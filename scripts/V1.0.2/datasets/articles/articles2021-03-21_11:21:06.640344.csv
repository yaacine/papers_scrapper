1164959,A review of the mathematical models for predicting the heating value of biomass materials,2012,JM Vargas-Moreno and AJ Callejón-Ferre and J Pérez-Alonso and Borja Velázquez-Martí,16,,5,3065-3083,Pergamon,Following the discovery of fire. biomass became the main source of energy used by mankind. Advanced societies have largely replaced the use of biomass with the use of fossil fuels. but our dependence on these ever scarcer resources. plus the need to reduce CO2 emissions in the face of climate change. is forcing us to make use of renewable sources of energy. including biomass. The exploitation of this resource often requires that its heating value be known. This can be determined either directly (though not cheaply) or by the use of models that predict it using a number of easily and economically determined variables. The present review gathers together the most recent models for predicting the heating value of biomass. assesses their areas of application. and highlights errors that have been made in their formulation. transcription. and in the references made to them.

The energy potential of this biomass is unclear. The aim of the present work was to accurately quantify this variable. differentiating between crop species while taking into consideration the area they each occupy. This. however. required the direct analysis of the higher heating value (HHV) of these residues. involving very expensive and therefore not commonly available equipment.

However. the difficulty involved in shrub management and the lack of information about behavior of this vegetation means that these areas are often left out of spatial planning projects. Airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) has been used successfully in forestry to estimate dendrometric and dasometric variables that allow to characterize forest structure. In contrast. little research has focused on shrub vegetation. The objective of this study was to estimate dry biomass of shrub vegetation in 83 stands of radius 0.5 m using variables derived from LiDAR data. Dominant species was Quercus coccifera. one of the most characteristic species of the Mediterranean forests.

Six different types of solely mechanical pruning were assessed. another six of mechanical pruning combined with subsequent manual pruning. and these were compared with traditional pruning. The most suitable method of cutting was determined as well as its influence on production. the quality of the fruit. and the biomass waste obtained. The results obtained indicate that the practice of mechanical pruning combined with manual pruning improves production. the cost being similar to traditional pruning. This means that profits are increased. The cost of combined pruning (mechanical + manual) is 800  ha-1. reaching an increase in production of 30 kg per tree. which is equal to 18 t of fruit/ha.

This iterative ST method (IST) is then compared to a different iterative superimposed training method of Meng and Tugnait (LSST).We show via simulations that the BER of our IST algorithm is very close to that of the LSST but with a reduced computational burden of the order of the channel length.

One of the main components in a drying system is the furnace. The furnace operation involves heat–mass transfer and combustion. thus it demands a complex mathematic representation. Since autoregressive methods are simple. and help to simulate rapidly a system. we model a drying furnace of olive pomace via an auto-regression with exogenous variables (ARXs) method. A neural network of radial basic functions (RBFs) defines the ARX experimental relation between the amounts of dry pomace (moisture content of 15%) used like fuel and the temperature of outlet gases. A real industrial furnace is studied to validate the proposed model. which can help to control the drying process.,True,wPCXno8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890412001975,2246446306211057752,/scholar?cites=2246446306211057752,,,0,0,0

The SOCP formulation allows converting the non-convex model of economic dispatch into a convex approach that guarantees the global optimum and has an easy implementation in specialized software. ie. CVX. This conversion is accomplished by performing a mathematical relaxation to ensure the global optimum in DCMG. The SOCP model includes changeable energy purchase prices in the DCMG operation. which makes it in a suitable formulation to be implemented in real-time operation.

A critical review of the literature was done. and mathematical models of drying curves proposed by investigators were evaluated. A comparison between the best mathematical models of fit in the drying curves used in past experiments and a two-term Gaussian model was performed. This model improved all the results of fit in each experiment. Drying rates and drying stages were obtained and discussed. An average drying rate for each experiment from the two-term Gaussian model was calculated. This value allowed for visualizing and comparing the average speed of evaporated water in each experiment for the different dryers. Finally. and after having verified that almost all drying occurs mainly by a diffusion phenomenon. an analysis on the effective moisture diffusivity and activation energy values was performed. The results indicated that there was no dependency of these quantities on independent variables such as the drying air temperature. the drying air velocity. and the sample thickness. It follows that drying of olive oil mill wastes is a very complex physical process that depends heavily on aspects such as pieces of pit. pulp. skin. vegetation water. olive oil content. sugars and organics compounds of different nature.,True,wPCXno8AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,10,https://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/7214,7923951138037417602,/scholar?cites=7923951138037417602,,http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/viewFile/BioRes_10_3_Cruz_Review_Drying_Kinetics_Olive_Oil_Wastes/3754,0,0,0

1165044,Effect of the size of the pupae. adult diet. oviposition substrate and adult population density on egg production in Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae).,2011,Berta Pastor and HELENA ČIČKOVÁ and Milan Kozánek and Anabel Martinez-Sanchez and PETER TAKÁČ and Santos Rojo,108,European Journal of Entomology,4,,,In order to enhance the mass production of the house fly. Musca domestica. five aspects of its oviposition biology were analyzed. Oviposition substrate and the manner of its presentation. the composition of the diet of the adults. size of the pupae and numbers of flies in a cage were identified as critical. Females preferred to lay eggs on a substrate which was presented within a shelter and with increased linear edges against which the flies could oviposit. Different types of oviposition substrate resulted in comparable yields of eggs. The presence of an oviposition attractant (ammonia) in the manure was found to have a potentially positive effect on female fecundity. Egg yield increased when two protein sources (yeast and milk) were included in the adult diet. However. flies fed a mixture of sugar and yeast laid over 50% fewer eggs than those fed the same proportion of sugar and milk. The fecundity of flies decreased with increase in the number of flies per cage. but the highest total number of eggs per cage was obtained when the flies were most crowded (14.2 cm3 per fly). The size of the pupae did not significantly affect egg production.,True,nIvVDsIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,46,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Milan_Kozanek/publication/270496580_Effect_of_the_size_of_the_pupae_adult_diet_oviposition_substrate_and_adult_population_density_on_egg_production_in_Musca_domestica_Diptera_Muscidae/links/56693b6e08ae8d6928fc0df7.pdf,3910405459161668136,/scholar?cites=3910405459161668136,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Milan_Kozanek/publication/270496580_Effect_of_the_size_of_the_pupae_adult_diet_oviposition_substrate_and_adult_population_density_on_egg_production_in_Musca_domestica_Diptera_Muscidae/links/56693b6e08ae8d6928fc0df7.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. the biological and genetic differences between different laboratory strains of M. domestica were analysed. Additionally. hybrids were obtained by mixing the strains and their biological parameters were also measured. The three strains of M. domestica presented differences in their biological and morphological parameters. the main differences were: size. egg production and developmental time. The strain A (specimens from Central Europe) had the best qualities to be used in mass-rearing conditions: it produced the largest quantities of eggs (5.77±0.38 eggs per female per day). the individuals were larger (12.62±0.22 mg) and its developmental time was shorter (15.22±0.21 days). However. the strain C (specimens from SW Europe) produced the fewest eggs (3.15±0.42 eggs per female per day) and needed 18.16±0.49 days to develop from larva to adult. whilst the females from strain B (from South America) produced 4.25±0.47 eggs per day and needed 17.11±0.36 days to complete its development. Genetic analysis of the original laboratory strains showed four different mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I haplotypes.

This covering leads to an overall degradation of the energy produced by that panel. Experiments on the shadow effects of artificial cover. which leads to degraded power generation. were conducted and analyses performed. The obtained results show that the variation in the reduction of PV voltage and power produced from each cell depends on the shadow effect created. Shading causes a decrease in the output of PV. and this chapter’s experiments illustrate the extent of that reduction.

Hot air can be used for drying applications. A single pass PVT with rectangle tunnel absorber has been developed. The rectangle tunnel acted as an absorber and was located at the back side of a standard photovoltaic panel. The dimension of the photovoltaic panel was 120 cm X 53 cm. The size of the rectangle tunnel was 27 units of tunnel bar with the size of 1.2 cm X 2.5 cm X 120 cm (width X tall X length) and 12 units with 1.2 cm X 2.5 cm X 105.3 cm (width X tall X length). The rectangle tunnel was connected in parallel. The PVT collector has been tested using a solar simulator. Results: Electrical efficiency increased when the solar cell was cool by air flow. Solar photovoltaic thermal collector with rectangle tunnel absorber has better electrical and thermal efficiency compared to solar collector without rectangle tunnel absorber.

1165257,The Effect of Atomizer Position in a Curved Duct on the Humidification Process of Steadily Flowing Air,2013,Sabah Tarik Ahmed and AJ Mohammed and Hussein Hayder Mohammed Ali,31,Eng. & Tech. Journal,5 Part A,793-815,,An experimental study is conducted on the utilization of water atomization to evaluate its impact on the humidification of steadily flowing air travelling throughout a curved portion of a uniform cross sectional duct. One of the more interesting aspects of curved channel flows is the introduction of a secondary flow pattern in the duct cross-section. The naturally generated turbulences in air flow will certainly assist the mixing between the air and the injected water droplets and improve the heat and mass transfer process encountered in evaporative cooling of the incoming air drought. The present study is considered as a simulation of the gas turbine inlet air cooling by the fogging technique. The drier the air. the better the humidification and cooling process. At higher ambient temperature of 43oC. an increase in the relative humidity of 67.8% and a temperature reduction of 39.6% were recorded at higher water atomizer rate of 24.2 ml/s. Generally. the lower half of the curved duct is shown to be less sensitive to the atomizer position for a range of inclination angles between 10o to 45o with radial locations between 5 to 20cm from the inner wall. This situation makes this region most suitable for using atomizing array across it in order to give acceptable performance for cooling system. Nevertheless. the upper half of the curved duct introduces a critical atomizer position suitable for single point spray. This position is considered as the optimum atomizer position defined by a radii ratio of (r/rin= 3.2) and an orientation of-10o to the tangential flow.,True,a-E6yNsAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,3,https://www.uotechnology.edu.iq/english/tec_magaz/2013/volum312013/No.05.A.2013/Text%20(1).pdf,257791462055704927,/scholar?cites=257791462055704927,,https://www.uotechnology.edu.iq/english/tec_magaz/2013/volum312013/No.05.A.2013/Text%20(1).pdf,0,0,0

Journal,4,,,In the current study simulation method was used for design of solar water heating system. An integrated transient simulation program was built up for simulating the Iraqi solar house heating system using TRNSYS as a design tool. The modeling was carried out is modeled for other virtual solar heating systems similar to the Iraqi solar house. The results obtained were used to develop a general design procedure for solar heating systems in Baghdad. Using the design charts and TRNSYS as a design tool simplifies the designer’s task for predicting the long-term heating energy supplied from a solar collector array.The above simulation was applied for Iraqi solar house and the results gave the increasing in storage volume caused increase the auxiliary energy supplied to the system. So. the best practical storage volume is 20m3 and increasing the collector area to optimum value results in increasing the solar fraction (f). The solar fraction may reach 0.97 when the collector area becomes as 400m2 at storage volume of 20m3.,True,a-E6yNsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://www.uotechnology.edu.iq/tec_magaz/volum292011/No.4.2011/text/Text%20(4).pdf,14802274693926446097,/scholar?cites=14802274693926446097,,https://www.uotechnology.edu.iq/tec_magaz/volum292011/No.4.2011/text/Text%20(4).pdf,0,0,0

Journal,4,,,An experimental and numerical investigation is carried out for the heat transfer from a cube faces subjected to impinging jet which centrally strikes the top face of the cube. The cube is subjected also to a comparatively low velocity cross flow through the duct occupying the cube. Different factors affecting the cooling characteristics of the cube are studied as orifice size. jet velocity and orifice to cube top distance. The results show that cross flow increases heat rates from the cube for small size orifices and low impinging jet velocities.

In this research. an experimental study was performed to investigate the thermal behaviour of a double skin roof model. The model was made of two parallel galvanized steel plates. Galvanized steel has been used in the roof construction of industrial buildings and storehouses in Iraq. The effect of inclination angle (ϴ) from the horizontal and the spacing (S) between the plates was investigated at different radiation intensities. It is found that using a double skin roof arrangement with a sufficient air gap (S) can reduce the heat gain significantly. The higher the inclination angle (ϴ) the higher the ventilation rate. the lower the heat gain through the roof. In this study. increasing the air gap from 2 cm to 4 cm reduced the heat gain significantly but when the gap was further increased to 6 cm. the reduction in the heat flux was insignificant. A dimensionless correlation was also reduced between Nusselt number () and the single parameter where L is the channel length.

1165268,Selection of OptimumRadiant Barrier System (RBS) Location in Double Skin Ventilated Roofs,2020,Mohannad R Ghanim and Sabah T Ahmed,12,Al-Khwarizmi Engineering Journal,1,32-41,,Double skin ventilated roof is one of the important passive cooling techniques that aims to reduce solar heat gain through roofs by reducing both the conduction and convection heat transfer from the roof to the ceiling of buildings. On the other hand. radiant barrier system (RBS) is very powerful in blocking the radiation heat transfer between the two skins. In this research. the effect of placing a thin layer of aluminium foil at different locations on the thermal insulation performance of a double skin ventilated roof model is investigated experimentally and the optimum location that transmits less heat flux from the lower skinis specified. The model is made of two parallel inclined galvanized steel plates. Galvanized steel has been used in the roof construction of industrial buildings and storehouses in Iraq. The radiant barrierisapplied alternately. on the outer surface of the upper skin. on the inner surface of the upper skin. suspended in the airgap between the skins. and on the inner surface of the lower skin.

This study was done by changing the parallel flow configuration into counter flow configuration under turbulent flow regime. The nanofluids (Ag. Cu and ZrO2–distilled water) at0. 5%. 1%. 2%. 3% and 5% particle volume concentration were prepared by two step method. The nanofluid can be applied in helical coiled tube heat exchanger to enhancement heat transfer. The use of nanofluid (Ag. Cu and ZrO2–DW) significant gives higher Nusselt number than distilled water base fluid. The presence of Ag. Cu and ZrO2 nanoparticles attributes to the generation of strong nanoconvection current and better mixing. Nanofluids that contain metal nanoparticles Ag. Cu show more enhancements compared to oxide nanofluids ZrO2–DW The shear stress of nanofluids increases with an increase in concentration of nanoparticles for both parallel flow and counter flow. No much impact of changing flow direction on overall heat transfer coefficient and the nanofluids (Ag. Cu and ZrO2–DW) behaves as the Newtonian fluid for 0.5%. 1%. 2%. 3% and 5%. The pressure drop and friction factor of the nanofluid are approximately the same as those of water. This implies that the nanofluid incurs no penalty of pump power and may be suitable for practical application. This study indicated that the thermal performance from nanofluid (Ag–DW) is higher than (Cu–DW) and (ZrO2–DW) due to higher thermal conductivity for the silver.

Kraft paper. glass. sodium salts. ceramic glazes. pharmaceuticals. dyeing of textile fibers etc. Part of its requirement is met from by-products of manufacturing processes like Aluminium silicate. rayon etc. Presently. evaporation followed by crystallization is the preferred technique for recovery of the salt. This technique becomes uneconomical when the waste water has low concentration of the salt. There is a need to develop new techniques for economical concentration of sodium sulphate. Keeping this in mind efforts were made to test the performance of two commercial CSM membranes Model Nos. NE-1812-70 and RE 1812-50 for concentrating the waste water stream. The results show that waste water stream could be concentrated. at pressure of 25 bar. up to 14.1% at permeate flux of 2.08 L-min-1-m-2 with NE-1812-70 membrane compared to 9.29% at permeate flux of 0.62 L-min-1-m-2 with RE 1812-50 membrane.

The current study aims to evaluate the possibility of operating the spark ignition engines by enriching the liquefied petroleum gas with volumetric fractions of natural gas. such as 30. 50. 70 and 80%. The influence of some design factors such as compression ratio and some operational factors such as the equivalent ratio. spark timing. and engine speed have been studied in detail. The study showed that the highest useful pressure of LPG is 10.5: 1 while natural gas was 13: 1. When adding natural gas to LPG. the compression ratio can be increased to a certain limit to be the highest increase in the mixing ratio of 80% with a compression ratio of 11.6: 1. The natural gas has a low flame propagation speed so the spark timing should be provided when added to the LPG. The addition of this addition reduces the induced power at a low speed due to this natural gas characteristic. Natural gas reduces the engine's output power by reducing the engine's volumetric efficiency by entering the combustion chamber with its gas phase.,True,EO0-w1EAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Khalid_Reza/publication/317604768_The_effect_of_adding_NG_to_LPG_on_a_spark_ignition_engine/links/5942c7a1aca2722db499c8c4/The-effect-of-adding-NG-to-LPG-on-a-spark-ignition-engine.pdf,967559898636308160,/scholar?cites=967559898636308160,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Khalid_Reza/publication/317604768_The_effect_of_adding_NG_to_LPG_on_a_spark_ignition_engine/links/5942c7a1aca2722db499c8c4/The-effect-of-adding-NG-to-LPG-on-a-spark-ignition-engine.pdf,0,0,0

LFCs for each area are designed based on availability of frequency deviation of each area and tie-line power deviation between areas. The fuzzy logic system approximation capabilities are exploited to develop suitable adaptive control law and parameter update algorithms for unknown interconnected LFC areas.

The clearness index is the proportion of extraterrestrial radiation reaching a location. where the extraterrestrial value used in the calculation varies with latitude and time of year. These correlations have been developed using data principally from latitudes greater than 40°. often using only data from a few locations and with few exceptions have not used solar altitude as a predictor.

A review of the literature,2014,Christian John Reynolds and Jonathan David Buckley and Philip Weinstein and John Boland,6,,6,2251-2265,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,This paper reviews the current literature around the environmental impacts of dietary recommendations. The focus of the review is on collating evidence relating to environmental impacts of the dietary advice found in the World Health Organisation guidelines. and environmental impact literature: reducing the consumption of fat. reducing the consumption of meat-based protein and animal-based foods. and increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables. The environmental impact of reducing dietary fat intake is unclear. although reducing consumption of the food category of edible fats and oils appears to have little impact. However most. but not all. studies support environmental benefits of a reduced consumption of animal-based foods and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables. In general. it appears that adhering to dietary guidelines reduces impact on the environment. but further study is required to examine the environmental impacts of animal-based foods. and fruit and vegetable intake in depth.

This study presents an estimate of the value of seagrass habitats in terms of the contribution to secondary production of some important South Australian fish species in a broad scale domain. The approach we take considers the relationship between primary production estimates for seagrass habitats in temperate and subtropical coastal waters and estimates of commercial. recreational and discarded catch figures. The paper briefly describes models which link expected harvest of different species to seagrass area and the consequent expected reduction in catch given seagrass decline. We estimate that the economic contribution of seagrass habitats to secondary production in the gulf waters of South Australia is of the order of $ A114 million per year.

Spells of several consecutive days of unusually high temperatures have led to increased mortality rates for the more vulnerable in the community. The problem is compounded by the escalating energy costs and increasing peak electrical demand as people become more reliant on air conditioning. Domestic air conditioning is the primary determinant of peak power demand which has been a major driver of higher electricity costs. This report presents the findings of multidisciplinary research which develops a national framework to evaluate the potential impacts of heat waves. It presents a technical. social and economic approach to adapt Australian residential buildings to ameliorate the impact of heat waves in the community and reduce the risk of its adverse outcomes. Through the development of a methodology for estimating the impact of global warming on key weather parameters in 2030 and 2050. it is possible to re-evaluate the size and anticipated energy consumption of air conditioners in future years for various climate zones in Australia. Over the coming decades it is likely that mainland Australia will require more cooling than heating. While in some parts the total electricity usage for heating and cooling may remain unchanged. there is an overall significant increase in peak electricity demand. likely to further drive electricity prices.

We quantify the tonnages. costs. and environmental impact of food rescued. and then compare food rescue to other food waste disposal methods composting and landfill. To our knowledge this is the first manuscript to comprehend the psychical flows of charity within an Input-Output framework—treating the charity donations as a waste product. We found that 18.105 tonnes of food waste was rescued. and calculate that food rescue operations generate approximately six kilograms of food waste per tonne of food rescued. at a cost of US $222 per tonne of food rescued. This a lower cost than purchasing a tonne of comparable edible food at market value. We also found that per US dollar spent on food rescue. edible food to the value of US $5.71 (1863 calories) was rescued. Likewise. every US dollar spent on food rescue redirected food that represented 6.6 m 3 of embodied water. 40.13 MJ of embodied energy. and 7.5 kilograms of embodied greenhouse gasses (CO 2 equivalents) from being sent to landfill or composting. and into mouths of the food insecure.

The Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM) is used to solve this problem. The base fluid is water containing different kinds of nanoparticles namely copper. silver. alumina and titanium oxide. The effective thermal conductivity and viscosity of the nanofluid are calculated using the Maxwell–Garnetts (MG) and Brinkman models. respectively. The analytical investigation is carried out for various governing parameters such as the squeeze number. nanoparticle volume fraction and Eckert number.

This study compared proposed conventional wastewater systems. both large and small scale. with separation systems:  one in which urine is handled separately and one in which black water is treated in a liquid composting process. The study showed that large economies of scale. in environmental terms. could be gained both for the operation and for the construction phase. The separation systems outperformed the conventional systems by showing lower emissions to water and more efficient recycling of nutrients to agriculture. especially of nitrogen but also of phosphorus.

A similar concept has been formulated for population tolerance. but we suggest that the concept is more useful when applied at the community level. Our examination of some crucial points behind PICT. using arsenate and periphyton communities. demonstrates that (1) the tolerance increase can be determined in short-term photosynthesis experiments.(2) PICT correctly indicates changes in species composition and net production. and (3) the selection pressure of arsenate is specific—that is. a tolerance increase for one compound is not followed by co-tolerance to other …,True,9S4R4twAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,349,https://www.astm.org/DIGITAL_LIBRARY/STP/PAGES/STP26265S.htm,2970421216511545694,/scholar?cites=2970421216511545694,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sverker_Molander/publication/284661690_Pollution_-_induced_community_tolerance/links/56752c5908aebcdda0e24cea.pdf,0,0,0

Their omission can lead to serious underestimates. particularly for meat. Here we estimate emissions from the conversion of forest to pasture in the Legal Amazon Region (LAR) of Brazil and present a model to distribute the emissions from deforestation over products and time subsequent to the land use change. Expansion of cattle ranching for beef production is a major cause of deforestation in the LAR. The carbon footprint of beef produced on newly deforested land is estimated at more than 700 kg CO2-equivalents per kg carcass weight if direct land use emissions are annualized over 20 years. This is orders of magnitude larger than the figure for beef production on established pasture on non-deforested land.

It remains virtually unknown as to how these technologies affect fish. and rotor collisions have been postulated as a major concern. In this study the effects of a vertical axis hydrokinetic rotor with rotational speeds up to 70 rpm were tested on the swimming patterns of naturally occurring fish in a subtropical tidal channel. Fish movements were recorded with and without the rotor in place. Results showed that no fish collided with the rotor and only a few specimens passed through rotor blades. Overall. fish reduced their movements through the area when the rotor was present. This deterrent effect on fish increased with current speed. Fish that passed the rotor avoided the near-field. about 0.3 m from the rotor for benthic reef fish. Large predatory fish were particularly cautious of the rotor and never moved closer than 1.7 m in current speeds above 0.6 ms-1. The effects of the rotor differed among taxa and feeding guilds and it is suggested that fish boldness and body shape influenced responses. In conclusion. the tested hydrokinetic turbine rotor proved non-hazardous to fish during the investigated conditions. However. the results indicate that arrays comprising multiple turbines may restrict fish movements. particularly for large species. with possible effects on habitat connectivity if migration routes are exploited. Arrays of the investigated turbine type and comparable systems should therefore be designed with gaps of several metres width to allow large fish to pass through.

Because some of these turbines are large. with rapidly moving rotor blades. the risk of collision with aquatic animals has been brought to attention. The behavior and fate of animals that approach such large hydrokinetic turbines have not yet been monitored at any detail. In this paper. we conduct a synthesis of the current knowledge and understanding of hydrokinetic turbine collision risks. The outcome is a generic fault tree based probabilistic model suitable for estimating population-level ecological risks. New video-based data on fish behavior in strong currents are provided and models describing fish avoidance behaviors are presented. The findings indicate low risk for small-sized fish. However. at large turbines (≥5 m). bigger fish seem to have high probability of collision. mostly because rotor detection and avoidance is difficult in low visibility. Risks can therefore be substantial for vulnerable populations of large-sized fish. which thrive in strong currents. The suggested collision risk model can be applied to different turbine designs and at a variety of locations as basis for case-specific risk assessments. The structure of the model facilitates successive model validation. refinement and application to other organism groups such as marine mammals.,True,9S4R4twAAAAJ:t7zJ5fGR-2UC,50,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117756,989434105349269910,/scholar?cites=989434105349269910,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117756,0,0,0

In this study. we assess life cycle resource requirements of producing an electrode area of graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and compare to the production of indium tin oxide (ITO). The resources considered are energy and scarce metals. The results show that graphene layers can have lower life cycle energy use than ITO layers. with 3–10 times reduction for our best case scenario. Regarding use of scarce metals. the use of indium in ITO production is more problematic than the use of copper in graphene production. although the latter may constitute a resource constraint in the very long run. The substitution of ITO by graphene thus seems favorable from a resource point of view.

CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done. biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat. electricity or hydrogen) to society.

Both of these factors depend on the assumptions made concerning the underlying utility and welfare functions. It is common to aggregate welfare gains and losses across generations and countries as if the utility of money were constant. but it is not. If we assume that a e CO2-equivalent dlubling implies costs equal to 1.5% of the income in both high and low income countries. a pure rate of time preference equal to zero. and a utility function which is logarithmic in income. then the marginal cost of CO2 emissions is estimated at 260–590 USD/ton C for a time horizon in the range 300–1000 years. an estimate which is large enough to justify significant reductions of CO2 emissions on purely economic grounds.

We claim that this approach might involve underestimating uncertainty in order to lay out a vision of future events sufficiently precise to be captured in a  discounted cost flow analysis in integrated assessment models. However. since the future of climate change is truly uncertain. this approach might at  best be marginally helpful and at worst downright dangerous: underestimating uncertainty can lead to strategies that do not defend the world against unexpected and sometimes even catastrophic threats. Another danger lies on the other extreme: if the global community can not find a strategy that works under traditional analysis or if uncertainties are too large that clear messages are absent. they may abandon the analytical rigor of their planning process altogether and base their decisions on good instinct and consensus of some future process that is easy to agree upon.   In this paper. we try to outline a system to derive strategic decisions under uncertainty for the climate change dilemma. What follows is a framework for determining the level of uncertainty surrounding strategic decisions and for tailoring strategy to that uncertainty.

1165525,Are the economic costs of stabilising the atmosphere prohibitive?,2002,Christian Azar and Stephen H Schneider,42,Ecological economics,1-2,73-80,Elsevier,Macro economic studies of the costs of reducing CO2 emissions generally estimate the global cost of stabilising the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 in the range 350–550 ppm in trillions of USD. This creates the impression that the cost of CO2 reductions is so large that it threatens economic development. But. presented in another way. a completely different picture emerges. There is widespread agreement amongst the more pessimistic macro economic studies that stringent carbon controls are compatible with a significant increase in global and regional economic welfare. Even if the cost of CO2 abatement rises to 5% of global income per year by the end of this century. this reduction is minor compared with the tenfold increase in global income that is expected. Since income is assumed to grow by a couple of percent per year. the trillion USD cost could also be expressed as a few years delay in achieving an …,True,z0x7ig4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,195,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800902000423,2079804334097212915,/scholar?cites=2079804334097212915,,http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/EconomicCostsOfStabilizingClimate.pdf,0,0,0

However. quantitative policy assessments routinely treat technological change as a factor that is independent of policy. Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 cannot be achieved through marginal changes in the way we supply and use energy. The only path to stabilization of climate over the next century that is consistent with widely accepted population and economic-growth scenarios involves substantial decoupling of energy services from carbon emissions. The required rate of structural and technical change for such a goal has been experienced only in the wake of economic and resource crises and for periods of a decade or less.

We argue that: fundamentally different allocation methodologies (that avoid updating and referencing against projected emissions) must be considered for Phase 2; that industrial concerns about competitiveness should be carefully scrutinized on a specific sub-sector basis rather than taken as a generic reason for generous allocations; and that EU-level institutions should agree stronger guidelines to ensure a greater degree of coordination. comparability and transparency in Phase 2 national allocation plans.,True,z0x7ig4AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,109,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2005.9685545,1560541783849328438,/scholar?cites=1560541783849328438,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Grubb/publication/233576880_Allowance_allocation_in_the_European_emissions_trading_system_A_commentary/links/53dba9570cf2cfac9928f63b/Allowance-allocation-in-the-European-emissions-trading-system-A-commentary.pdf,0,0,0

The framework takes into account how energy policies affect the oil market. the expected oil price increase. and the disruption costs. OPEC's strategic behavior is modelled as a dominant firm. and the model includes price interdependence between different energy commodities to better estimate the cost of an oil disruption. It is found that substituting pellets for oil in households and using imported sugar cane ethanol are cost-efficient policies if greenhouse gas benefits are included. Domestically produced wheat ethanol is not found to be cost-efficient even if both the expected cost of oil disruption and greenhouse gas benefits are included. the same also holds for hybrid vehicles.

Other studies have found that substantial reductions can be justified on economic grounds. This paper explores into the reasons for these differences and identifies four (partly overlapping) crucial issues that have to be dealt with when analysing the economics of the greenhouse effect: low-probability but catastrophic events; cost evaluation methods; the choice of discount rate; the choice of decision criterion. The paper shows that (i) these aspects are crucial for the policy conclusions drawn from models of the economics of climate change. and that (ii) ethical choices have to be made …,True,z0x7ig4AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,107,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008235326513,13276801430875009157,/scholar?cites=13276801430875009157,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.163.2417&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

This paper reviews different weight factors that have been used in the climate economics literature. Based on a simple model. it is shown that although the different weight factors imply substantially different cost-damage estimates. they actually yield the same optimal emission reductions. This paradox is explained by the fact that some of the approaches require that also the abatement costs are weighted – and this offsets the effect of the diverging cost-damage estimates. The model is then used to analyse the importance weighting may have on the overall cost-benefit analysis. At present. when most of the global emissions of (fossil) CO2 originate from the industrialised countries. the global optimal emissions are considerably lower if costs are weighted.

1165549,Functions in innovation system approaches,2001,Anna Johnson,,"Nelson and Winter Conference, Aalborg, Denmark",,12-15,,In the last twenty years. a large number of innovation system approaches have emerged. Even though there are similarities between different approaches. they emphasise different aspects of innovation systems. Moreover. within each approach the system models differ in terms of the concepts used and the actors identified and emphasised. It might. therefore. be useful to see if there is any agreement between the approaches with respect to what they claim “happens” in an innovation system. ie what functions are served in the system. The purpose of this paper is twofold:(1) to find out if existing innovation system approaches share an understanding of the functions that are served in an innovation system and (2) to elaborate on the usefulness of the concept of “function” in innovation system studies. In summary. there seems to be quite a widely spread correspondence between different innovation system approaches with respect to the functions they mention so that a number of common. basic functions can be identified. The concept of “function” has several benefits. It provides a tool for setting system borders and may be used as a tool to diagnose the present state of a system or to create an easily grasped picture of innovation system dynamics. It makes it possible to assess system performance and may be useful in comparative studies since actors may be uncoupled from what happens in the system.,True,KXzIricAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,389,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.4807&rep=rep1&type=pdf,18231781466008314807,/scholar?cites=18231781466008314807,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.4807&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

While TIS studies have always considered various kinds of contextual influences. we suggest that the TIS framework can be further strengthened by a more elaborated conceptualization of TIS context structures and TIS–context interactions. For that purpose. we identify and discuss four especially important types of context structures: technological. sectorial. geographical and political. For each of these. we provide examples of different ways in which context structures can interact with a focal TIS and how our understanding of TIS dynamics is enhanced by considering them explicitly.

Established competence-based and market-based explanations of this phenomenon argue that incumbents are seriously challenged only by ‘competence-destroying’ or ‘disruptive’ innovations. which make their existing knowledge base or business models obsolete and leave them vulnerable to attacks from new entrants. This paper challenges these arguments. With detailed empirical analyses of the automotive and gas turbine industries. we demonstrate that these explanations overestimate the ability of new entrants to destroy and disrupt established industries and underestimate the capacity of incumbents to perceive the potential of new technologies and integrate them with existing capabilities.

Firms’ strategies are central to innovation. but strategic options are shaped and constrained by environmental factors: collaborative patterns. regulatory systems. customary practices. etc.. are phenomena which persist in a systemic way and which inflect how innovation may occur.

But what if this model is precisely wrong. ie. what if these assumptions do not hold?How can you make sensible policy or strategy in a non-deterministic. evolutionary. and highly complex world. ie. a world where the most desirable outcomes are unknown but where there may be many possible acceptable outcomes. where change is characterized by both path dependence and unpredictability. and where there are many diverse components. interactions and feedback among components. and multiple dimensions to each problem?

We describe that the emergence of a new innovation system and changes in existing innovation systems co-evolve with the process of technological change. Therefore. it is necessary to create more insight in the dynamics of innovation systems. Traditional methods of innovation system analysis that mainly focus on the structure of innovation systems have proven to be insufficient. Therefore. we propose a framework that focuses on a number of processes that are highly important for well performing innovation systems. These processes are labeled as ‘functions of innovation systems’. After explaining this framework and embedding it in existing literature. we propose a method for systematically mapping those processes taking place in innovation systems and resulting in technological change.

The instruments are called systemic in the expectation that they will improve the functioning of entire (innovation) systems. A first step in designing systemic instruments is an analysis of the systemic problems that hinder the development of a specific technological trajectory.

Many environmental problems (such as water pollution. local air pollution. acid rain) have since been solved or substantially reduced by policies and incremental clean technologies (eg fuel gas desulphurisation in power plants. three-way catalytic converters in cars). but other problems have grown worse. eg climate change. loss of biodiversity. deforestation. depletion of fish stocks and of clean water supplies.

One way to deal with this is to support the development of sustainable energy technologies. Since the development and diffusion of renewable energy has proved to be a very slow process. strategic insight is needed into how the emergence of these technologies takes place and how this process can be accelerated. The objective of this book is to gain insight into the dynamics of technological change with a focus on sustainable energy technologies. As the theoretical starting point. the Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) framework is used. The TIS is a structure made up of actors. institutions and technologies. in which the development and diffusion of new technologies takes place. For the successful development of a technology. a TIS needs to be built up. This build-up is understood as the unfolding of key activities. or system functions. that take place within the TIS. The system functions are types of activities necessary for a TIS to develop and to yield fruitful innovations. These involve Entrepreneurial Activities. Knowledge Development. Knowledge Diffusion. Guidance of the Search. Market Formation. Resource Mobilisation and Support from Advocacy Coalitions. The author develops the idea that the build-up of a TIS. especially in a formative stage. can accelerate due to positive interactions between these system functions.

At the same time. it has been criticized for a number of issues and innovation scholars have made suggestions of how to improve the framework. In this viewpoint. we respond to six areas of criticism: (1) TIS context. (2) system delineation. (3) spatial aspects. (4) transitions. (5) politics. and (6) policy recommendations. We point to promising conceptual developments of how to address shortcomings and highlight needs for further research. We also discuss the prospects of the TIS approach for the analysis of socio-technical transitions.

We argue that at the current stage of development. substitution of conventional car technology by a new automotive propulsion technology may lead to premature lock-in of suboptimal technology. To avoid such lock-in. one should value the variety of current R&D activity that enables organizations to learn from multiple options and to create spillovers between options. We further argue that the existence of technological variety is not a sufficient condition to avoid lock-in. Organizational variety is also required to sustain competition and avoid the dominance of few firms that possibly enforce a suboptimal technology within the sector.

Four house types are modeled with increasing quantities of wood used in constructions. CO2 emission reductions of almost 50% are technically possible. We assess the innovation characteristics of these wood applications to create insights in the complexity of the necessary change process. Then we relate the innovation characteristics of the wood options to the context in which implementation of the technologies take place. The options vary strongly in the required technical and network changes and so do the opportunities to implement them.

It is assumed that for an emerging technology to fruitfully develop. it should be fostered by a Technological Innovation System (TIS). which is the network of actors. institutions and technologies in which it is embedded. For an emerging technology a TIS has yet to be built up. This research focuses on the dynamics of this build-up process by mapping the development of seven key activities: so-called system functions. The main contribution revolves around the notion of cumulative causation. or the phenomenon that the build-up of a TIS accelerates due to system functions reinforcing each other over time. As an empirical basis. an analysis is provided of the historical development of the TIS around automotive natural gas technology in the Netherlands (1970–2007).

In this way the indicators may give a warning signal to an unsustainable use of resources early in the chain from causes in societal activities to environmental effects. The aim is that these socio-ecological indicators shall serve as a tool in planning and decision-making processes at various administrative levels in society. The formulation of the indicators is made with respect to four principles of sustainability. which lead to four complementary sets of indicators.

CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done. biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat. electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity. hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage.

These losses are expected for two primary reasons: a reduction in the consumption of oil in importing countries and a reduction in the producer price of oil (taxation in an importing country implies a transfer of rents from producers to consumers). So far. most studies have focused on these two mechanisms and corroborated that revenue losses for OPEC are to be expected. However. there are also mechanisms that may be expected to raise the price of oil products. In a cost-effective regime for dealing with climate change. i.e.. a regime in which all or most countries participate and in which the same carbon price is applied on all carbon-emitting activities. the cost of using unconventional oil. or synthetic diesel from coal. will increase even …,True,MhYy_k0AAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,55,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421507002583,14238171244046752525,/scholar?cites=14238171244046752525,,https://www.academia.edu/download/65217237/j.enpol.2007.06.02720201218-13315-1lyqzrn.pdf,0,0,0

The treatment of technological change in energy system models is a critical challenge. Technological change may be treated as induced by climate policy or as exogenous. We investigate the importance of induced technological change (ITC) in GET-LFL. an iterative optimization model with Limited Foresight that incorporates Learning-by-doing. Scenarios for stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at 400. 450. 500 and 550 ppm are studied. We find that the introduction of ITC reduces the total net present value of the abatement cost over this century by 3-9% compared to a case where technological learning is exogenous. Technology specific policies which force the introduction of fuel cell cars and solar PV in combination with ITC reduce the costs further by 4-7% and lead to significantly different technological solutions. primarily in the transport sector.,True,MhYy_k0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,54,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=2135,11903506082750582338,/scholar?cites=11903506082750582338,,https://www.iaee.org/en/publications/download-instant.aspx?id=2135,0,0,0

The analysis is carried out with a regionalized version of the Global Energy Transition model. GET-R 6.0. Two different carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction scenarios are applied. both meeting an atmospheric CO2 concentration target of 450 ppm by the year 2100. The first scenario. “global cap” (GC). uses a global cap on CO2 emissions. and global emissions trading is allowed. In the second scenario. “regional caps” (RC). industrialized regions start to reduce their CO2 emissions by 2010 while developing regions may wait several decades and emission reductions are not tradable across regions.

The network approach to urban modeling is based on the assumption that the market dynamics that generates land values can be represented as a growing scale-free network. Our results suggest that the network properties of trade between specialized activities cause land values. and likely also other observables such as population. to be power-law distributed.

The evolutionary stability of populations has been analysed in the literature for the case where mutations in the population may be considered as isolated events. For this case. and assuming simple trigger strategies and many iterations per game. we analyse the rate of convergence to the evolutionarily stable populations. We find that for some values of the payoff parameters of the Prisoner's Dilemma this rate is so low that the assumption. that mutations in the population are infrequent on that time-scale. is unreasonable. Furthermore. the problem is compounded as the group size is increased.

The purpose is to retain the explanatory power of earlier models due to Simon.

In this sense. the model presented here is a combination of the two factors that have been identified as central to urban evolution but rarely appear unified in the same model: transportation costs and multiplicative growth.

Staying abreast of the electromobility trend poses challenges for automakers. One challenge is that electrification requires knowledge and competences that are different from those associated with the internal combustion engines (ICE). 1 Integrating components such as electric motors. batteries and regenerative braking systems. for instance. requires that automakers develop more complex systems to control and monitor electrical subsystems and components (see Chapters 3 and 4). Such developments require automakers to further develop competences in fields such as electronics and computing. Connecting electric vehicles to the electricity grid requires developments in ICT and utilises competences from electric power engineering. often in collaboration with utility companies (see Chapter 9). Specifically. electromobility means that automakers must integrate three competences areas that are sometimes described as ‘me-chem-tronics’(mechanical. chemical and electronic competences). alongside raw material management. 2 Overall the transition to electromobility means that automakers must increasingly draw on skills and knowhow that are beyond their traditional competence bases (see Chapter 2).1 Aggeri F.

1165631,Environmental Technology Assessment of Introducing Fuel Cell City Buses. A Case Study of Fuel Cell Buses in Goeteborg,2002,Magnus Karlström,,,,,,Over the last several years. fuel cell systems have improved. These advancements have increased the expectations that fuel cells are a feasible option for several applications such as transportation and stationary use. There are several reasons why fuel cell buses in city centres appear to be the most beneficial market niche to begin introducing the technology in. The goal of the report is to compile information about fuel cell buses relevant for city administrators working with public transport and environmental issues. A literature review of the fuel cells in buses is included. This study also consists of an environmental assessment of using fuel cell buses with hydrogen produced in various ways for buses on bus route 60 in Goeteborg by 2006. The fuel cell buses are compared with other bus and fuel alternatives. There are two goals of the case study: 1. The first goal is to describe the technical system. the methodology. and the problem for the intended audience. In the future. this study could help frame future investment decisions. 2. The second goal is to present environmental performance results---emission. health. monetary---relative the alternative bus technologies.

The answer is: Most day-to-day mobility takes place within local-regional labour and service markets. Thus. it is above all. mobility on this level that has to be reformed and brought into the framework of environmental sustainability. particularly if mobility on other levels (long-distance travel and transports. at least some air travel) is to be possible. These micro-regions typically have diameters of roughly 100 kilometres (60 miles). Their size is a function of the time at households’ disposal. which in turn sets the bounds for what activities are socially and humanly possible. given the multiple roles individuals play in their daily lives.

I wondered what this way of travelling might have to do with Life Cycle Assessment? The explanation is given at pp. 7 and 8 of this hilarious book: the title is a reference to a book by Douglas Adams1 and more specifically to the frustrating answer given by a supercomputer called'Deep Thought'2 to a question relating to the last secret of the universe:'42'. This meanwhile became popular as' 42 method'. The book tries the contrary: to give a down-to-earth textbook of LCA as it is–or at least should be–used by most practitioners. Modern theory and latest developments of LCA are not ignored. but the bulk of the book presents LCA in a form that can be used by well-trained students. researchers and practitioners in industry and consultancy. In some way it is astonishing that. 15 years after the birth of modern LCA. such a book (in English) has not been written before. There are several excellent monographs on the market. but no genuine textbook. This new textbook fills the gap. It has 13 chapters (organized in three parts: Introduction to LCA. 50 pp.; LCA methodology. 160 pp; LCA applications. 110 pp.) and additionally exercises (110 pp.). appendices (general inventory data. characterisation indicators and weighting indices). Glossary. Index (a total of 543 pp.). Since I assume (and strongly suggest) that most readers not yet owing this book will order and read it. I am not going to describe it in detail.

Due to limited knowledge on the application of SDIs in Swedish water utilities. a series of field studies were carried out in order to find out whether and how SDIs are applied. Concurrently. a literature survey was performed concerning the current use of SDIs in organizations in general.

Utsläppen har också minskat över tid. Det är förstås en viktig framgång. Men vad den nationella statistiken. som publiceras i enlighet med Kyotoprotokollet. inte säger något om är de utsläpp som vår konsumtion och livsstil för med sig globalt sett. Denna rapport utgår från ett konsumtionsperspektiv i analysen av svenskarnas utsläpp. Där inkluderas alla utsläpp av växthusgaser. även de som uppstår i andra länder från varor som vi importerar och från internationella transporter. På motsvarande sätt räknas de utsläpp som genereras av svensk export bort. Med ett sådant angreppssätt ser utvecklingen annorlunda ut.När växthusgasutsläppen från konsumtionen i Sverige analyseras över tid märks en gradvis ökning. Enligt Naturvårdsverket var dessa utsläpp 17 procent högre 2011 än vad de var 1993. Bakom den ökningen döljer sig en kraftig stegring av konsumtionsvolymen. motsvarande 45 procent i fasta priser.

Under an ambitious climate target. land that may be used for both bioenergy plantations and long-rotation forests. are likely to be scarce. and thereby competition between long-rotation forests and bioenergy plantations can be expected. The goal of the study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of bioenergy plantations versus long-rotations forests aimed at capturing and storing carbon.

However. recent analyses have argued that the carbon footprint (CF) of ruminant meat and dairy products are substantially reduced if one adopts alternative metrics for comparing emissions of GHGs—eg. the 100 year global temperature change potential (GTP 100). instead of the commonly used 100 year global warming potential (GWP 100)—due to a lower valuation of CH 4 emissions. This raises the question of which metric to use. Ideally. the choice of metric should be related to a climate policy goal.

Most studies of cost and feasibility of stringent climate targets that include nuclear power focus on the currently available light water reactor (LWR) technology. Since climate mitigation requires a long-term commitment. the inclusion of other nuclear technologies such as mixed oxide-fuelled LWRs and fast breeder reactors may better describe the future energy supply options. These different options also entail different nuclear weapon proliferation risks stemming from uranium enrichment or reprocessing of spent fuel.

Four different PHEV integration strategies. with different impacts on the total electric load profile. have been investigated. The study shows that PHEVs can reduce the CO2-emissions from the power system if actively integrated. whereas a passive approach to PHEV integration (i.e. letting people charge the car at will) is likely to result in an increase in emissions compared to a power system without PHEV load. The reduction in emissions under active PHEV integration strategies is due to a reduction in emissions related to thermal plant start-ups and part load operation. Emissions of the power sector are reduced with up to 4.7% compared to a system without PHEVs. according to the simulations.

1165720,Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as a mean to reduce CO2 emissions from electricity production,2009,Lisa Göransson and Sten Karlsson and Filip Johnsson,,"Proceedings of EVS24, Stavanger, May",,13-16,,In this study we have investigated the consequences of integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV: s) in a wind-thermal power system supplied by one quarter of wind power and three quarters of thermal generation. A fleet of PHEV: s with an electricity consumption corresponding to 3%. 12% and 20% of the total electricity consumption has been integrated to the system (ie the total electricity consumption remains unaffected while the non-PHEV consumption is 97%. 88% and 80% in the three cases). Four PHEV integration strategies. with different impacts on the total electric load profile. have been investigated by means of a mixed integer model which can model the effects of the new load profiles on the dispatch of the units in the system and. thus. on the CO2-emissions from the system. The study shows that PHEV: s can reduce the CO2-emissions from the power system if actively integrated. whereas a passive approach to PHEV integration (ie letting people charge the car at will) is likely to result in an increase in emissions compared to a power system without PHEV load.The model simulations give that CO2 emissions of the power sector are reduced with up to 4.7% compared to a system without PHEV: s. If the reduction in emissions is allocated to the electricity consumed by the PHEV: s. the emissions from generation of this electricity are reduced from 588 kgCO2/MWh (windthermal system without PHEV: s) down to 367 kgCO2/MWh (PHEV: s actively integrated).

Between 2002 and 2007 consumer amenities such as acceleration capacity and passenger space continued to increase while fuel consumption steadily decreased. During these years the main technological and market change was a shift toward diesel and flex-fuel ethanol vehicles. After 2007 the average weight and power of the vehicles were more or less constant. while fuel consumption decreased by 13% between 2007 and 2010. The developments after 2007 suggest that 77% of the technological development between 2002 and 2010 resulted in reductions in fuel consumption compares to previous years when 35% of any technology change resulted in a net reductions.

The most common purpose for storing electricity is of course to convert the stored energy back to electricity when needed. Currently there are not many mature alternatives for seasonal energy storage. Pumped hydro. hydrogen and compressed air are facing challenges with geographical distribution and ecological footprint. technical limitations or low density.2 Another option is to convert electricity into an energy carrier that can be used for other purposes. and not just as a medium for electricity storage. One possibility is to use periods of excess electricity for the production of carbon-based synthetic fuels. so called electrofuels.3 that can be used for various purposes. e.g. for heating. as a transportation fuel or in the chemical industry for the production of plastics. textiles. medicine and fertilizers. One challenge. common to all energy storage technologies. is to be economically viable in spite of the fact that excess. or low priced. electricity will likely be available only a fraction of the time. This chapter aims to explore the challenges and opportunities of using electrofuels to utilise excess electricity.

1165740,Characterization of fluid dynamics of fluidized beds by analysis of pressure fluctuations,2007,Srdjan Sasic and Bo Leckner and Filip Johnsson,33,,5,453-496,Pergamon,This paper reviews procedures for investigating the fluid-dynamic behavior of gas–solid fluidized beds using pressure signals as obtained from modeling or experiments. The procedures studied are applicable to all types of fluidized-bed reactor. Models generating pressure data in such systems are presented with respect to complexity and amount of information provided. There is a discussion on how a calculated pressure can be compared to a measured signal in order to create a reliable representation of the fluid dynamics of the system. The type of information resulting from various ways of measuring the pressure in fluidized beds is discussed. as well as the use of absolute versus differential pressure probes. Time series analysis is reviewed; it can be applied to modeled and measured pressure signals in time. frequency. time–frequency and state space.

The bottom bed is the dense bubbling zone just above the distributor. The experimental work was carried out in a 12 MWth CFB boiler and in a cold CFB. Three different distributions of the bubble flow in time and space. termed fluidization regimes. were identified in the cold CFB: the multiple bubble regime with many small bubbles evenly distributed in the bed; the single bubble regime. characterized by the presence of only one bubble at a time in the bed; and the exploding bubble regime with large. single. irregular voids stretching from the air distributor to the bed surface. These bubbling conditions were observed during variations in the gas velocity and the distributor pressure drop.

NY (United States),The vertical distribution of solids was studied by means of pressure drop measurements in a 12 MWth CFB boiler. Silica sands with average particle sizes of 0.20 mm. 0.32 mm. and 0.44 mm were used as bed materials. The primary gas velocities ranged from 1.5 m/s to 6 m/s. In some runs. secondary air was added as well. Three zones were identified with respect to the vertical distribution of solids in the furnace: a bottom bed zone with constant solids concentration. a splash zone with an exponential decay in particle concentration with height. and with a strong solids backmixing. and a transport zone. also with an exponential decay in solids concentration. but with a lower value of decay constant. with solids backmixing mainly at the furnace walls. In spite of primary gas velocities greatly exceeding the terminal velocity of the bed particles. a bottom bed was present having an average solids concentration of about 1000kg/m {sup 3}(porosity 0.6). Relating the primary gas velocity to the terminal velocity of the bed material. the same splash-zone decay constant was obtained for all three bed materials.

Four different PHEV integration strategies. with different impacts on the total electric load profile. have been investigated. The study shows that PHEVs can reduce the CO2-emissions from the power system if actively integrated. whereas a passive approach to PHEV integration (i.e. letting people charge the car at will) is likely to result in an increase in emissions compared to a power system without PHEV load. The reduction in emissions under active PHEV integration strategies is due to a reduction in emissions related to thermal plant start-ups and part load operation. Emissions of the power sector are reduced with up to 4.7% compared to a system without PHEVs. according to the simulations.

Measurements were carried out in a 100 kW test unit. designed for oxy-fuel combustion with flue gas recycling. Gas concentration and temperature profiles in the furnace were measured during combustion of lignite. The tests comprise a reference test in air and three oxy-fuel cases with different oxygen fractions in the recycled feed gas. With the burner settings used. lignite oxy-combustion with a global oxygen fraction of 25 vol % in the feed gas results in flame temperatures close to those of air-firing. Similar to previous work. the NO emission [mg/MJ] during oxy-fuel operation is reduced to less than 30% of that of air-firing.

Twelve energy saving measures (ESMs) are assessed using a bottom–up modeling methodology. in which the Swedish residential stock is represented by a sample of 1400 buildings (based on data from the year 2005). Application of the ESMs studied gives a maximum technical reduction potential in energy demand of 53%. corresponding to a 63% reduction in CO2 emissions.

A detailed gas-phase model identifies the effect of temperature. stoichiometric ratio. residence time and composition of the oxidizer on NOx reduction. It is concluded that an efficient high-temperature reduction of NOx is achieved with high-purity oxygen. negligible amount of air ingress. presence of a sub-stoichiometric combustion zone. and relatively long residence time. The temperature should be high but decreasing along with the NOx concentration throughout the reaction zone.

1165749,The market and the forum: three varieties of political theory,1997,Jon Elster,3,Deliberative democracy: Essays on reason and politics,,18,MIT Press,I want to compare three views of politics generally. and of the democratic system more specifically. I shall first look at social choice theory. as an instance of a wider class of theories with certain common features. In particular. they share the conception that the political process is instrumental rather than an end in itself. and the view that the decisive political act is a private rather than a public action. viz. the individual and secret vote. With these usually goes the idea that the goal of politics is the optimal compromise between given. and irreducibly opposed. private interests. The other two views arise when one denies. first. the private character of political behavior and then. secondly. goes on also to deny the instrumental nature of politics. According to the theory ofJurgen Habermas. the goal of politics should be rational agreement rather than compromise. and the decisive political act is that of engaging in public debate with a view to the emergence of a consensus. According to the theorists of participatory democracy. from John Stuart Mill to Carole Pateman. the goal of politics is the transformation and education of the participants. Politics. on this view. is an end in itself—indeed many have argued that it represents the good life for man. I shall discuss these views in the order indicated. I shall present them in a somewhat stylized form. but my critical comments will not.

1165763,Resources. environment. and economics: applications of the materials/energy balance principle,1978,Robert U Ayres,,,,,John Wiley and Sons. New York. NY,This book attempts to present. concisely. 1) the basic economic and physical theory underlying modern resource/environmental economics. 2) its application to the construction of analytical models. and 3) the corresponding requirements for statistical data. Placing particular emphasis on realistic empirical models. the book maps past. present. and future flows of materials and energy from extraction through successive stages of processing. consumption. and back to the environment as wastes. Special attention is given to problems of optimal technology choice. The book then concludes with a discussion of available data sources. and the organization of data into appropriate statistical subsystems in order to facilitate more comprehensive and reliable future evolutionary versions of the various models considered. This book is unusual in the degree to which it jointly treats economic and technological considerations. It contributes to economic theory by underlining the need for broader paradigms incorporating physical laws. constraints. and properties of materials. It contributes to modeling by showing. through numerous examples. how material/energy flows can be linked to traditional ecomomic variables within a single framework.,True,igKKg6IAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC,507,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6267976,16596998614238345355,/scholar?cites=16596998614238345355,,,0,0,0

The total weight of secondary fossil fuel and chemical inputs to produce and use a single 2-gram 32MB DRAM chip are estimated at 1600 g and 72 g. respectively. Use of water and elemental gases (mainly N2) in the fabrication stage are 32 000 and 700 g per chip. respectively. The production chain yielding silicon wafers from quartz uses 160 times the energy required for typical silicon. indicating that purification to semiconductor grade materials is energy intensive.

1165765,Accounting for growth: the role of physical work,2005,Robert U Ayres and Benjamin Warr,16,Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,2,181-209,North-Holland,This paper tests several related hypothesis for explaining US economic growth since 1900. It begins from the belief that consumption of natural resources—especially energy (or. more precisely. exergy) has been. and still is. an important factor of production and driver of economic growth. However the major result of the paper is that it is not ‘raw’ energy (exergy) as an input. but exergy converted to useful (physical) work that—along with capital and (human) labor—really explains output and drives long-term economic growth. We develop a formal model (Resource-EXergy Service or REXS) based on these ideas. Using this model we demonstrate first that. if raw energy inputs are included with capital and labor in a Cobb–Douglas or any other production function satisfying the Euler (constant returns) condition. the 100-year growth history of the US cannot be explained without introducing an exogenous ‘technical …,True,igKKg6IAAAAJ:j7_hQOaDUrUC,498,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954349X03000778,18148233624920588401,/scholar?cites=18148233624920588401,,https://www.academia.edu/download/32795734/ayreswarr2005accountinggrowthrolephysicalwork.pdf,0,0,0

The reality is different and more complex. A ‘growth engine’ is a positive feedback loop involving declining costs of inputs and increasing demand for lower priced outputs. which then drives costs down further. thanks to economies of scale and learning effects. In a competitive environment prices follow. The most important ‘growth engine’ of the first industrial revolution was dependent on coal and steam power. The feedback operated through rapidly declining fossil fuel and mechanical power costs. The advent of electric power. in growing quantities and declining cost. has triggered the development of a whole range of new products and industries. including electric light. radio and television. moving pictures. and the whole modern information sector.

The major implications of the First Law (conservation of mass/energy) are straightforward and have been discussed at length elsewhere. In brief. raw material inputs to economic processes are not `consumed'. Having been extracted from the environment in the first place. they eventually return to the environment as wastes. The economic implications of the Second Law (entropy law) are far more subtle. There is considerable literature. initiated by the work of Georgescu-Roegen. on the supposed constraints on economic growth imposed by the fact that economic processes utilize `low-entropy' raw materials (fossil fuels and high grade metal ores) and discard `high entropy' wastes.

We show how the enormous potential for adding value while reducing material inputs can be realized in almost every sector of the economy. Many of these gains can be obtained by ‘internalizing’ the product. In many cases there is a large scope for ‘double dividends’. by which we mean increased profits for the firm combined with environmental improvement. We also discuss the role of government regulation as a driver of change. Finally. we review a number of specific cases from (mostly) European firms. with emphasis on the potential for internalizing the product by recovery. remanufacturing and materials recycling.

Analysts are also interested in forecasting future materials/energy fluxes on regional and global scales. as a function of various economic growth and regulatory scenarios. A fundamental tenet of LCA is that every material product must eventually become a waste. To choose the ‘greener’ of two products or policies it is necessary to take into account its environmental impacts from ‘cradle to grave’. This includes not only indirect inputs to the production process. and associated wastes and emissions. but also the future (downstream) fate of a product. The first stage in the analysis is quantitative comparisons of materials flows and transformations. Energy fluxes are important insofar as they involve materials (e.g.. fuels. combustion products).

The analysis shows almost 90% higher specific energy use (GJ/m2) for the top-down methodology. The differences are only around 20% for the share coupled to production and processing of building materials. while for other involved sectors such as transport. construction activities. production of machines and service sectors. the input–output analysis gives much higher values.

The statistics for new-constructed multi-dwelling buildings indicate increasing energy use per floor area since 1995. and even more amazing: the new-constructed multi-dwelling buildings are at the same level of energy efficiency as the average existing building.

Improvements in efficiency may cause so-called rebound effects by reducing the prices of energy services as well as by increasing the budget for consumption of other goods and services. The magnitude of such effects is crucial to whether energy efficiency should be a strategy for environmental policy or not.

In new buildings the average specific energy use for heating is twice as high as in the best performing buildings 20 years ago. By combining econometric studies and interviews with actors in the building sector we analyse the underlying economic and organisational causes for this development. In the stock of buildings. specific energy use for heating (kWh/m2/yr) has a high correlation with increasing energy prices and price elasticities have not changed markedly over time. This implies that the stagnation to a large extent can be explained by energy price trends. On the contrary. in new buildings the correlation between energy prices and specific energy use is much weaker. One important cause of low sensitivity to price changes is that information about the life cycle cost (LCC) of different …,True,1I6ykowAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,99,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421508003467,16942291163982915631,/scholar?cites=16942291163982915631,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48325071/j.enpol.2008.07.01820160825-12378-c3lclg.pdf,0,0,0

An analysis of time use and consumption in Swedish households,2015,Jonas Nässén and Jörgen Larsson,33,Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy,4,726-745,SAGE Publications,This paper addresses the effect of working hours on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from private consumption. Time use and consumption patterns of Swedish households are analysed to estimate the effects of changing income and availability of leisure time. The results indicate that a decrease in working time by 1% may reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by about 0.7% and 0.8%. respectively. These results are mainly because of the effects of lower income and lower consumption. The partly offsetting effect of households having more time available for leisure activities is less than a tenth of the income effect. In a sketched scenario we also elaborate on the long-term impacts of a work time reduction. A gradual reduction towards a 30-hour working week in 2040 would result in a significantly slower growth of energy demand. which would also make it easier to reach climate targets.,True,1I6ykowAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,96,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/c12239,6643831991409257976,/scholar?cites=6643831991409257976,,http://digamoo.free.fr/nassenlarsson2015.pdf,0,0,0

However. this assumption has been questioned by researchers. who instead argue that people may live better lives by consuming less and reduce their environmental impact in the process. In this study we explore the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and subjective well-being. using a sample of 1000 Swedish respondents.Our results show that there is no strong link between an individual's emissions and subjective wellbeing. We also analyze the relationship between specific emission-intensive activities and subjective well-being and find that none of the activities examined correlates with subjective well-being.

The model optimizes a combination of energy efficiency measures. technologies and fuels for heat supply and district heating extensions over a 50 year period.

This idea is especially forceful since shorter work hours have possible positive consequences such as less time pressure and more time for activities which are important for subjective well being like social contacts. volunteer work and child care. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of this issue. analyzing the impact of work hours on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden. We use a micro-data approach analyzing how a change in work time affects the energy use of households via changing income and changing time use patterns. We assume that a change in work hours gives a proportional effect on income. We identify the marginal consumption through carrying out linear regressions. In addition we make similar regressions in order to estimate how the time is used when work hours are changed. The regression results are matched with energy intensities and greenhouse gas emissions per expenditure and per minute of time use. The results of this study indicate that an increase or decrease in work time by 10 percent gives a change in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by about 8 percent on average. a bit less for high income households and a bit more for low income households. The increase or decrease in energy use with work hours is dominated by the effect of income.

To do this. we define the energy efficiency gap as being the difference between the ex ante market and techno-economic energy savings potentials. The estimation of market potential is based on top-down (econometric) modelling of energy demand using data from the period 1970–2005. The techno-economic estimates are made using a bottom-up building stock model (ECCABS) to assess the effects and cost-efficiency of various energy efficiency measures. Common to these two modelling approaches are two scenarios of energy prices. which differ only with respect to the carbon tax component.

1165799,Energy efficiency-Trends. determinants. trade-offs and rebound effects with examples from Swedish housing,2007,Jonas Nässén,,,,,,This thesis is based on five separate papers. The first paper analyses the development of the Swedish building sector over time by decomposing CO{sub 2} emissions in underlying trends. and studying separate energy use trends for existing buildings. new buildings and best available technology. The results show rapid improvements in energy efficiency during the seventies. but that this development stagnated in both existing and new buildings in the late eighties and nineties. and that the diffusion of energy efficient technologies appears to be slow. The specific energy use for heating in average new buildings is twice as high as in the best performing buildings 20 years ago. The second paper deals with the causes of these trends. including an econometric part and a qualitative part. The third paper handles indirect energy use and CO{sub 2} emissions coupled to the production phase of buildings. Results from an input-output analysis are disaggregated into activities and materials which can be compared to results from bottom-up studies. The results show only minor differences for production and processing of building materials. but for other upstream sectors such as transport. services and production of machines. the input-output analysis gives much higher values. This implies that bottom-up studies may underestimate the relative importance of energy use in the production phase in relation to the use phase.

1165804,Fuel taxes: An important instrument for climate policy,2007,Thomas Sterner,35,Energy policy,6,3194-3202,Elsevier,This article shows that fuel taxes serve a very important role for the environment and that we risk a backlash of increased emissions if they are abolished. Fuel taxes have restrained growth in fuel demand and associated carbon emissions. Although fuel demand is large and growing. our analysis shows that it would have been much higher in the absence of domestic fuel taxes. People often assert that fuel demand is inelastic but there is strong research evidence showing the opposite. The price elasticity is in fact quite high but only in the long-run: in the short run it may be quite inelastic which has important implications for policy makers. Had Europe not followed a policy of high fuel taxation but had low US taxes. then fuel demand would have been twice as large.

1165805,Discounting and distributional considerations in the context of global warming,1996,Christian Azar and Thomas Sterner,19,Ecological Economics,2,169-184,Elsevier,The economics of global warming is reviewed with special emphasis on how the cost depends on the discount rate and on how costs in poor and rich regions are aggregated into a global cost estimate. Both of these factors depend on the assumptions made concerning the underlying utility and welfare functions. It is common to aggregate welfare gains and losses across generations and countries as if the utility of money were constant. but it is not. If we assume that a e CO2-equivalent dlubling implies costs equal to 1.5% of the income in both high and low income countries. a pure rate of time preference equal to zero. and a utility function which is logarithmic in income. then the marginal cost of CO2 emissions is estimated at 260–590 USD/ton C for a time horizon in the range 300–1000 years. an estimate which is large enough to justify significant reductions of CO2 emissions on purely economic grounds.

In 1994. Varberg introduced a weight-based billing system for household waste charging 1 kr/kg of waste and at the same time recycling centers were set up and a ‘green shopping’ campaign was launched. This led to a significant reduction in waste collected and increased recycling. This study had access to actual measured data on waste disposal at the household level for a residential area called Tvååker. in addition to survey data for the same households. This makes it possible to carry out a more reliable and more detailed analysis than has been previously possible. particularly with respect to attitudinal variables.

The argument for using a declining discount rate (DDR) is simple: if the discount rates that will be applied in the future are uncertain but positively correlated. and if the analyst can assign probabilities to these discount rates. then the result will be a declining schedule of certainty-equivalent discount rates. There is a growing empirical literature that estimates models of long-term interest rates and uses them to forecast the DDR schedule. However. this literature has been criticized because it lacks a connection to the theory of project evaluation.

To economists this should be no surprise yet it seems that the role of fuel taxation as an instrument of climate policy has not been fully appreciated. It is however one of the few policy instruments that. since several decades. has actually reduced fuel consumption appreciably. Thanks to taxation (mainly in Europe and Japan). carbon emissions are considerably lower than they would have been otherwise. In future where carbon emissions are to be cut drastically. this instrument will be crucial. There is however much opposition to the instrument. This opposition uses various arguments. for instance that fuel taxes hurt the poor since they are strongly regressive.

1165819,Fuel taxes and the poor: the distributional effects of gasoline taxation and their implications for climate policy,2012,Thomas Sterner,,,,,Routledge,Fuel Taxes and the Poor challenges the conventional wisdom that gasoline taxation. an important and much-debated instrument of climate policy. has a disproportionately detrimental effect on poor people. Increased fuel taxes carry the potential to mitigate carbon emissions. reduce congestion. and improve local urban environment. As such. higher gasoline taxes could prove to be a fundamental part of any climate action plan. However. they have been resisted by powerful lobbies that have persuaded people that increased fuel taxation would be regressive. Reporting on examples of over two dozen countries. this book sets out to empirically investigate this claim. The authors conclude that while there may be some slight regressivity in some high-income countries. as a general rule. fuel taxation is a progressive policy particularly in low income countries. Rich countries can correct for regressivity by cutting back on other taxes that adversely affect poor people. or by spending more money on services for the poor. Meanwhile. in low-income countries. poor people spend a very small share of their money on fuel for transport. Some costs from fuel taxes may be passed on to poor people through more expensive public transportation and food transport. Nevertheless. in general the authors find that gasoline taxes become more progressive as the income of the country in question decreases. This book provides strong arguments for the proponents of environmental taxation. It has immediate policy implications at the intersection of multiple subject areas. including transportation. environmental regulation. development studies. and climate change …,True,QPcgMqwAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,149,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iurFBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT10&dq=info:mFUe4uT6eLUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=FGTB2VTZPl&sig=gJK_h2CnFGG6dVp2in_QWvPuPow,13076477379023361432,/scholar?cites=13076477379023361432,,,0,0,0

There has been a marked increase in national policies and legislation on climate change since the AR4 with a diversity of approaches and a multiplicity of objectives (see Section 15.2). However. Figure 1.9 of Chapter 1 suggests that these policies. taken together. have not yet achieved a substantial deviation in emissions from the past trend. Limiting concentrations to levels that would be consistent with a likely probability of maintaining temperature increases below 2 degrees C this century (scenarios generally in the range of 430-480 ppmv CO2eq) would require that emissions break from these trends and be decreased substantially. In contrast. concentrations exceed 1000 ppmv CO2eq by 2100 in many baseline scenarios (that is. scenarios without additional efforts to reduce emissions).   The literature on mitigation scenarios provides a wide range of CO2 shadow price levels consistent with these goals. with estimates of less than US$50/tCO2 in 2020 in many studies and exceeding US$100/tCO2 in others. assuming a globally-efficient and immediate effort to reduce emissions. These shadow prices exhibit a strongly increasing trend thereafter. Policies and instruments are assessed in this light.   Section 15.2 assesses the role of institutions and governance. Section 15.3 lays out the classification of policy instruments and packages. while 15.4 discusses the methodologies used to evaluate policies and institutions. The performance of various policy instruments and measures are individually assessed in Sections 15.5 and 15.6.

This suggests that the food and agricultural systems are hard to manage and that sensible food policies are difficult to formulate. Better tools to analyze and evaluate national agricultural policies can help improve them. A set of models was created for this purpose and linked together to cover the world's agriculture. This book presents the methodological underpinnings and empirical elaborations of that linked system of national models. The model system. developed by the Food and Agriculture Program of IIASA in cooperation with the Centre for World Food Studies (SOW) in Amsterdam. is called the BLS (Basic Linked System). mainly for historical reasons. Obviously. to understand the background. we must turn briefly to the history of the project.The BLS can be looked at as the successor to MOIRA: Model of International Relations in Agriculture. which Linnemann et al.(1979) developed at the request of the Club of Rome. MOIRA. like the BLS. is a general equilibrium model. consisting of standard national models. However. these national models are far less detailed than the ones in the I3LS. MOIRA is largely based on cross-country regressions. thus permitting the modelers to distinguish a larger number of countries (106) and a larger number of social classes (six agricultural and six nonagricultural).

1165831,Towards free trade in agriculture,2013,Kirit S Parikh and Günther Fischer and Klaus Frohberg and Odd Gulbrandsen,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Agriculture seems to be a difficult sector to manage for most governments. Developing countries face tough dilemmas in deciding on appropriate price poli eies to stimulate food production and maintain stable. preferably low. prices for poor consumers. Governments in developed countries face similar difficult deci sions. They are called upon to give income guarantees to farmers whose incomes are unstable and relatively low when compared to those in the nonagricultural sector. These guarantees often lead to ever-increasing budgetary outlays and unwanted agricultural surpluses. High prices make new investments and the application of new technologies more attractive than world prices warrant. and a process is set in motion where technological innovation attains amomenturn of its own. in turn requiring price policies that maintain their rates of return. Surpluses are disposed of with subsidies in domestic markets or in the international market. Price competition reduces the market share of other exporters. who may be efficient producers. unless they are willing to engage in subsidy competition. This lowers export earnings and farm incomes or depletes the public resources of developing countries that export competing products. Retaliatory measures have led to frictions and further distortions of world prices. Every so orten the major agricultural exporters-the USA. the EC. Aus tralia. or Canada-accuse one another of unfair intervention. Though they have agreed to discuss agricultural trade liberalization under GATT negotiations. if anything. the expenditure on farm support has continued to increase in both the EC and the USA.,True,lPdOt1oAAAAJ:k_IJM867U9cC,141,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=psX0CAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:7fFXxXZ04kIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MAFwkjZgsE&sig=nNSb1eo9LTsxYnmGb5Xvvlw0y28,4819542604705690093,/scholar?cites=4819542604705690093,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/3063/1/XB-88-701.pdf,0,0,0

Different scenarios are generated using the model. Since comparison of GDP in two alternative scenarios can be misleading. the policy alternatives are assessed on the basis of their impact on welfare in terms of equivalent incomes of different expenditure classes. A policy is assessed preferable only when the distribution of welfare is found to be preferable in a well defined way.

The planning problem involves optimal placement and sizing of capacitors in a network such that operating and investment costs are minimum. A simple bus-wise cost-benefit analysis (CBA) scheme is proposed which involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively. The proposed CBA incorporates detailed hourly loading conditions at a bus and achieves a fairly accurate estimate of the benefits from capacitor placement. The formulation is directly handled by the well known MINOS code and is solved efficiently. It obviates the need to introduce integer variables and is thus suitable for large system applications.

Carbon cost “pass-through” is critical to the survival of existing coal generation assets and has been discussed widely as a measure of business impact in the electricity industry. This paper sets out in a structured way the factors that determine price pass-through and why this may differ greatly across different systems. Although the basic concept of price pass-through is simple. a clear understanding of the underlying factors is critical to developing insights on how carbon cost would impact on existing coal generation businesses. It is shown that pass-through can vary drastically if the underlying dispatch potential of generators varies significantly across alternative emissions reduction scenarios.

The paper presents a linear programming formulation of an energy brokerage system in an operational planning framework. Emission trading among utilities is envisaged to achieve emission reduction targets. The power and emission buy/sell quotes for individual utilities are computed and communicated to a central broker. The broker determines the power and emission interchange schedule which maximizes the power system savings for all participating utilities. The Shapley value criterion is proposed for allocation of cost savings among the utilities. This criterion reflects the true marginal contribution of a utility to the aggregate system savings and hence. is superior to the existing methods of cost savings allocation.,True,dZ_nQVwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,35,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/476061/,14909986713709336138,/scholar?cites=14909986713709336138,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52076035/Energy_brokerage_system_with_emission_tr20170308-28535-cbszpz.pdf,0,0,0

1165892,Promoting private sector financing of commercial investments in renewable energy technologies,2002,Norbert Wohlgemuth and Jyoti Painuly,,Testing New Policy Approaches,,319,,Too much investment is directed towards conventional energy technologies. even where commercially available energy efficient and renewable technologies are technically feasible and economically attractive. The fact that renewable energy technologies (RETs) account for only a modest proportion of the world’s commercial energy demand suggests that there are obstacles to their implementation. These obstacles (either financial or non-financial) need to be identified and addressed in order to design innovative policy approaches for the international and domestic sector financing of RETs. It is clear that a strategy to increase the market share of renewable energy should address the full range of obstacles. Since the use of renewable energy contributes to all dimensions of sustainable development. particularly in developing countries. one of the challenges for energy policy is to ensure that environmentally sound technologies. including RETs. have a fair opportunity to compete for the resources required for the provision of energy services.The coming together of the renewable energy industry and the financial sector cannot yet be regarded as a marriage made in heaven. There is considerable suspicion and misunderstanding on both sides which permeates all RET sectors. as well as most levels of financial institutions. In order to overcome the “understanding gap” between the worlds of renewable energy and financing. various initiatives have been launched recently to bring these two together. Innovation in financing mechanisms to advance RET projects can be as important as technological breakthroughs.,True,ZKBBCj0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,18,http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/hpg/envis/sdev/nairobi_meeting.pdf#page=325,17465098088241364947,/scholar?cites=17465098088241364947,,http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/hpg/envis/sdev/nairobi_meeting.pdf#page=325,0,0,0

1165894,Renewable energy financing-what can we learn from experience in developing countries?,2006,Jyoti Prasad Painuly and Norbert Wohlgemuth,14,Energy Studies Review,2,,,Renewable energy (RE) has been considered as one of the stronger contenders to improve the plight of nearly two billion people. mostly in rural areas. without access to modern forms of energy. Although the economics of renewable energy technologies (RETs) have yet to reach a stage where these could replace fossil fuels on a significant scale. many experts argue that technologies such as solar. wind. and small-scale hydropower are not only economically viable but also ideal for rural areas. The mismatch between the potential and actual use of RE ca n be attributed to barriers in its implementation. Among others. a lack of financing has been one of the important barriers adversely affecting the widespread use of RETs. In developing countries. a majority of initiatives have focused on financial incentives. The re are successes as well as failures from the models adopted. The paper discusses problems related to financing RETs. by focusing on small-scale off-grid RETs in developing countries. and reviews some of these model s to bring out the lesson s that we can learn to accelerate the availability of finance to RETs.,True,ZKBBCj0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,17,https://energystudiesreview.ca/esr/article/view/499,10407289839671217095,/scholar?cites=10407289839671217095,,https://energystudiesreview.ca/esr/article/download/499/477,0,0,0

We show that the developing countries will always be better-off participating in the CDM if the emissions quota they get in the post-Kyoto period is not linked to their baseline emissions. However if their quota equals (or is related to) their baseline emissions. CDM participation strategy may be a preferred alternative only if the CDM price is high enough to off-set the losses of the post-Kyoto period (during ET regime) due to participation in the CDM. We simulate the CDM and ET in the Kyoto and post-Kyoto period and show that with the reduction targets given in the Kyoto Protocol for Annex B countries. participation in the CDM is beneficial to non-Annex B (developing) countries. even if their emissions quota …,True,ZKBBCj0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,17,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021366319476,7188695513424247424,/scholar?cites=7188695513424247424,,,0,0,0

1165897,Environmentally sound energy efficient strategies: A case study of the power section in India,1997,Jyoti Parikh and Jyoti P Painuly and Kankar Bhattacharya,,,,,,Coal is a major source of energy in India. providing more than 60% of the commercial energy requirements. Coal is also most polluting fuel in terms of GHG emissions. Considering India`s energy resources. coal may continue to provide a large part of energy requirements in the future too. Coal is mainly used for generating electricity. Therefore. efficient measures for generation. transmission and end use of electricity can help in reducing the environmental pollution. leading to environmentally sound development. The report highlights some such important measures; reduction in auxiliary consumption (i e. the electricity consumed by generating units in the process of generation). reduction in transmission and distribution losses. and application of demand side management (DSM) options for high tension (HT) industries. The study was conducted in two phases. Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). the largest utility in Maharashtra was chosen for the detailed study in the first phase. For the study of auxiliary consumption. two typical plants of the MSEB were selected. The transmission losses were studied for the MSEB system based on a snap-shot picture of the system. For the DSM part. energy saving potential in HT industries in Maharashtra was explored based on a survey of HT industries. In the second phase of the study. two more plants outside Maharashtra were also studied to get better insight into diverse causes for the different levels of auxiliary consumption and estimate potential savings. All India potential for savings through reduction in auxiliary consumption was also estimated in this phase.

1165898,Policy analysis of oil substitution by natural gas in India: Transport and industry sectors,1993,JP Painuly and Jyoti Parikh,21,Energy policy,1,43-52,Elsevier,Diesel and fuel oil are the two major petroleum products consumed in the Indian economy. They are predominantly used in the transport and industry sectors. Both of these products can be partly substituted by natural gas (NG). which is indigenously available. The paper explores levels of substitutions that should be planned for diesel by compressed natural gas (CNG) driven vehicles and for fuel oil by natural gas. Such an approach would require maximization of consumers' and producers' surplus so that economic costs to the country and financial costs to the users are realistically assessed. It is shown that when international crude prices and refinery margins increase. the natural gas allocated to the transport sector increases. followed by the industry sector. This leads to savings of US$ 460–3700 million for crude price of $14 per barrel to $32 per barrel respectively.

To present the application and implications of the various methodologies and approaches in a concrete context. Africa’s largest wind farm—namely the 60 MW wind farm located in Zafarana. Egypt—is examined as a hypothetical CDM wind power projectThe report shows that for the present case example there is a difference of about 25% between the lowest (0.5496 tCO2/MWh) and the highest emission rate (0.6868 tCO2/MWh) estimated in accordance with these three standardized approaches to baseline development according to the Marrakesh Accord. This difference in emission factors comes about partly as a result of including hydroelectric power in the baseline scenario. Hydroelectric resources constitute around 21% of the generation capacity in Egypt. and. if excluding hydropower. the difference between the lowest and the highest baseline is reduced to 18%. Furthermore. since the two variations of the “historical” baseline option examined result in the highest and the lowest baselines. by disregarding this baseline option altogether the difference between the lowest …,True,ZKBBCj0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,11,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:38098242,1416727706743033930,/scholar?cites=1416727706743033930,,https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/38/098/38098242.pdf,0,0,0

Different cost components are identified. and subsequently. a generalized reactive power cost model is developed for wind turbine generators that can help the independent system operator (ISO) in managing the system and the grid efficiently.

The concept of electrical distance has been used to identify the different voltage-control areas within a power system. The proposed reactive power market is settled on uniform price auction. using a modified optimal power-flow model.

The planning problem involves optimal placement and sizing of capacitors in a network such that operating and investment costs are minimum. A simple bus-wise cost-benefit analysis (CBA) scheme is proposed which involves solving a modified optimal power flow problem (OPF) iteratively. The proposed CBA incorporates detailed hourly loading conditions at a bus and achieves a fairly accurate estimate of the benefits from capacitor placement. The formulation is directly handled by the well known MINOS code and is solved efficiently. It obviates the need to introduce integer variables and is thus suitable for large system applications.

The proposed approach consists of two stages. (i) cluster formation. and (ii) data transmission. In the first stage. a variable step size firefly algorithm (VSSFFA) is proposed for generating energy-aware clusters by optimal selection of cluster heads. The VSSFFA reduces the cost of locating optimal position for the head nodes in a cluster. Additionally. we proposed the VSSFFA-based approach within the cluster rather than base station. which makes it a semi-distributed method. The selection criteria of the objective function are based on the residual energy. intra-cluster distance. node degree and head count of the probable cluster heads. Data communication is done using data transmission stage. which reduces the latency. delay. and control overhead.

Before knowing the actual aspects of social media people must have to know what does social media mean? Social media is a term used to describe the interaction between groups or individuals in which they produce. share. and sometimes exchange ideas. images. videos and many more over the internet and in virtual communities. Children are growing up surrounded by mobile devices and interactive social networking sites such as Twitter. MySpace. and Facebook. Orkut which has made the social media a vital aspect of their life. Social network is transforming the behavior in which youthful people relate with their parents. peers. as well as how they make use of technology. The effects of social networking are twofold.[1] On the positive side. social networks can act as invaluable tools for professionals. They achieve this by assisting young professionals to market their skills and seek business opportunities. Social networking sites may also be used to network efficiently. On the negative side. the internet is laden with a number of risks associated with online communities. Cyber bullying. which means a type of harassment that is perpetrated using electronic technology. is one of the risks. In this paper we cover every aspect of social media with its positive and negative effects. Focus is on the particular field like health. business. education. society and youth.

Ltd.,Polyamide/silver (PA/Ag) composite materials are regarded as potential antimicrobials by virtue of their efficacy to release the Ag+ ions in an aqueous medium. The effects of the matrix crystallinity on the Ag+ ion release characteristics of PA/Ag composites are discussed. It is found that matrix crystallinity is very decisive for the silver ion releasing properties and hence the antimicrobial efficacy of silver‐based antimicrobial polyamides. The crystallinities of the composites were evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry. The silver ion release characteristics of these composites were measured by anode stripping voltammetry. Silver ion release was higher in systems possessing lower degrees of crystallinity. Water‐diffusion characteristics of the composites control the silver ion release. The effect of crystallinity on silver ion release rate depends on the time of soaking of the specimens in water.

HOX11 activation can occur in the absence of translocation of the gene to the T-cell receptor locus (Salvati et al.. 1995). implying that activation mechanisms must be involved other than the juxtaposition of the gene to adjacent enhancing sequences. We tested whether the methylation status of the proximal promoter was correlated with expression status in T-ALL and found that. in all cases. expression of HOX11 in T-ALL was associated with extensive demethylation of the proximal HOX11 promoter. regardless of whether or not translocation was involved.

Shippers' port selection. for export or import cargo. depends on the location of the shipper; preferences for shipping line services; and facilities offered by ports. In this paper. we model the port choice behaviour of shippers. in China. using a shipper level database obtained from a survey of shippers of containerised cargo in China in 1998. We use a discrete choice model where each shipper faces a choice of 14 alternatives. based on shipping line and port combinations. and makes his decision on the basis of various shipper and port characteristics. The results indicate that the distance of the shipper from port. distance to destination (in case of exports). distance from origin (in case of imports). port congestion. and shipping line's fleet size play an important role.

The efficiency of housing subsidies would depend on price elasticities of housing demand. Different households have different perceptions of housing demand based on their economic and demographic factors.

This paper models the port and shipping line choice behavior of shippers in China. using a shipper-level database obtained from a 1998 survey of containerized cargo shippers. We used a discrete choice model where each shipper chooses among 10 shipping line and port combinations and makes decisions based on various shipper and port characteristics. This paper incorporates the shipping line choice behavior through model specification by nesting the choices in a hierarchical fashion where shippers choose from Chinese and non-Chinese shipping lines and then from ports or vice versa.

They are also due to the problems that unplanned urbanization. income disparity. poverty. illiteracy. and unemployment brought. These issues extenuated the housing problem. causing a housing shortage of 51 million in 2011. Though India has a long history of establishing policies. programs. and institutions to cater to housing. without allocating adequate resources. their impact in ameliorating the shortage has been marginal. This paper argues that to address the housing shortage in India. there is desperate need to prepare a framework for housing by (i) including housing as a constitutional right;(ii) resolving issues of unclear land titles and ensuing claims;(iii) building adequate financial resources for affordable housing programs;(iv) building responsive instruments to facilitate the affordability of housing by all income segments; and (v) overcoming market segmentation. which is currently catering to the housing needs of creditworthy clients and is overlooking the growing demand from middle-and lower-income segments.

This sector is highly vulnerable to changes in pricing structure. Various construction techniques have been analysed and it is shown that a room of length 3.5 m. breadth 3.5 m and height 3.14 m would lead to about 6 tonnes of CO2 emissions if constructed at the minimum possible cost.

As such. housing can be thought of as the most universal property type. demand for which is directly related to population demographics and to micro-and macroeconomic factors like income growth and government policies. The demographics and the culture-based household characteristics are all critical determinants of the aggregate demand for housing. while other factors–wealth. age distribution. affordability etc.–tend to determine the types of housing most in demand. State of housing is a complex outcome of government policies. affordability and systems of provision of housing.

1165979,Performance evaluation of cost effective buildings—A cost. emissions and employment point of view,1996,Piyush Tiwari and Jyoti Parikh and Vinod Sharma,31,Building and Environment,1,75-90,Pergamon,Given the uphill task of providing housing for all within a short time frame and making it affordable. the construction industry has to look into various low cost options of construction using locally available building materials. This paper evaluates various dimensions of low cost techniques. For the same engineering criterion to be satisfied. a room of dimensions 3.5 m × 3.5 m × 3.14 m constructed using low cost techniques costs only 66% of the conventional construction cost. Since these materials are low energy consuming. the associated CO2 emission is also low. The CO2 emission with the conventional method of construction is 5.88 tonnes compared to 2.42 tonnes in the low cost method of construction. There is a possibility of further reducing the emissions by 23% with 0.03% increase in the cost. Another implicit advantage for a country like India with surplus labour force. is that employment increases with greater …,True,PuP_6zcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0360132395000100,16018189827273738956,/scholar?cites=16018189827273738956,,,0,0,0
1165980,Sustainable practices to meet shelter needs in India,2003,Piyush Tiwari,129,Journal of urban planning and development,2,65-83,American Society of Civil Engineers,Adequate shelter for all is one of the most pressing challenges faced by developing countries. Based on its census of 1991. India had a shortage of 18.5 million houses in 1991. and this number would have swollen since then. The construction sector represents the most pressing need. namely shelter. Technologies that are environmentally sustainable are another important issue in countries that are on the path to development. Earlier researchers have indicated that construction activity contributes 17% of the carbon dioxide emissions in India. This paper interweaves various issues and proposes a construction strategy for the Indian housing sector. Affordability of a house and availability of building materials for its construction are the main constraints upon access to shelter. This paper analyzes the possibility of containing cost and adopting technologies that can achieve lower emissions.

1165981,Modes of commuting in Mumbai: A discrete choice analysis,2001,Piyush Tiwari and Tetsu Kawakami,13,Review of Urban & Regional Development Studies,1,34-45,Blackwell Publishers Ltd,Using a nested multinomial logit model (NMNL). this paper estimates the choice probabilities and demand elasticities of various modal alternatives for Mumbai using 1990 trip origination and destination data. The results indicate that with an increase in the cost of private transit system. market share is reduced. The result of this experiment is highly elastic private commuting mode demand. In addition. reduction in the market share of own vehicles is larger than that of hired vehicles. The increase in the cost of mass transit system reduces its share but is inelastic. Decrease in the market share of one mode is accompanied by increase in the market share of others. Income has a positive effect on the market share of private transit modes. particularly on the own vehicles' share.

Since monthly mortgage payments cannot exceed 25% of current income. households tend to accumulate downpayments in the range of 30–45% of house value. This not only defers their entry into homeownership. but also has significant influence on the type of house eventually purchased. The objective of this study is to understand the changing access to ownership during the 1990s. with emphasis on wealth positions based on savings out of income. private transfers and bequests. and support from parents or other relatives. The source of data is the Ministry of Infrastructure. Land and Transportation survey on household home finance conducted from 1992 to 2000.

Buildings and activities in buildings are responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions. but they are also the key to mitigation strategies. In 2010. the building sector accounted for approximately 117 Exajoules (EJ) or 32% of global final energy consumption and 19% of energy-related CO2 emissions; and 51% of global electricity consumption. Buildings contribute to a significant amount of F-gas emissions. with large differences in reported figures due to differing accounting conventions. ranging from around an eighth to a third of all such emissions. The chapter argues that beyond a large emission role. mitigation opportunities in this sector are also significant. often very cost-effective. and are in many times associated with significant co-benefits that can exceed the direct benefits by orders of magnitude. The sector has significant mitigation potentials at low or even negative costs. Nevertheless. without strong actions emissions are likely to grow considerably - and they may even double by mid-century - due to several drivers. The chapter points out that certain policies have proven to be very effective and several new ones are emerging. As a result. building energy use trends have been reversed to stagnation or even reduction in some jurisdictions in recent years. despite the increases in affluence and population.

The model assumes that the VOCs originate predominantly in a uniform slab of polymer backing material. Parameters for the model (the initial concentration of a VOC in the polymer. a diffusion coefficient and an equilibrium polymer/air partition coefficient) are obtained from experimental data produced by a previous chamber study. The diffusion coefficients generally decrease as the molecular weight of the VOCs increase. while the partition coefficients generally increase as the vapor pressure of the compounds decreases. In addition. for two of the study carpets that have a styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) backing. the diffusion and partition coefficients are similar to independently reported values for SBR. The results suggest that prediction of VOC emissions from new carpets may be possible …,True,ojTG9D0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,332,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1352231094900973,18199407463027796401,/scholar?cites=18199407463027796401,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0t76c1pg/qt0t76c1pg.pdf,0,0,0

A Retrospective Examination of Long-Term Energy Forecasts for the United States,2002,Paul P Craig and Ashok Gadgil and Jonathan G Koomey,27,,1,83-118,Annual Reviews,This paper explores how long-term energy forecasts are created and why they are useful. It focuses on forecasts of energy use in the United States for the year 2000 but considers only long-term predictions. i.e.. those covering two or more decades. The motivation is current interest in global warming forecasts. some of which run beyond a century. The basic observation is that forecasters in the 1950–1980 period underestimated the importance of unmodeled surprises. A key example is the failure to foresee the ability of the United States economy to respond to the oil embargos of the 1970s by increasing efficiency. Not only were most forecasts of that period systematically high. but forecasters systematically underestimated uncertainties. Long-term energy forecasts must make assumptions about both technologies and social systems. At their most successful. they influence how people act by showing the …,True,ojTG9D0AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,275,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.energy.27.122001.083425,13565716202628051136,/scholar?cites=13565716202628051136,,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.energy.27.122001.083425,0,0,0

After adjusting for the lack of statistical representativeness of the data. we found that the distribution of leakage area normalized by floor area is approximately lognormal. Based on a classification tree analysis. year built and floor area are the two most significant predictors of leakage area: older and smaller houses tend to have higher normalized leakage areas than newer and larger ones. Multivariate regressions of normalized leakage are presented with respect to these two factors for three house classifications: low-income households. energy program houses. and conventional houses.

1166014,Critique of the use of deposition velocity in modeling indoor air quality,1993,William W Nazaroff and Ashok J Gadgil and Charles J Weschler,,,,,ASTM International,Among the potential fates of indoor air pollutants are a variety of physical and chemical interactions with indoor surfaces. In deterministic mathematical models of indoor air quality. these interactions are usually represented as a first-order loss process. with the loss rate coefficient given as the product of the surface-to-volume ratio of the room times a deposition velocity. In this paper. the validity of this representation of surface-loss mechanisms is critically evaluated. From a theoretical perspective. the idea of a deposition velocity is consistent with the following representation of an indoor air environment.

1166015,Comparing zonal and CFD model predictions of isothermal indoor airflows to experimental data.,2003,L Mora and AJ Gadgil and E Wurtz,13,Indoor air,2,77-85,,It is inappropriate to use the assumption of instantaneously well-mixed zones to model airflows and pollutant transport in large indoor spaces. We investigate two approaches for describing the details of airflows in large indoor spaces. for accuracy and suitability for integration with multi-zone infiltration models. One approach. called the zonal method. was developed over the last 15 years to provide an improvement over the well-mixed assumption. The second approach is the use of a computational fluid dynamics simulation using a coarse grid model of the large indoor space. We compare velocity predictions from different formulations of zonal methods and coarse-grid k-epsilon computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. to measurements. in a 2D mechanically ventilated isothermal room. Our results suggest that. when airflow details are required. coarse-grid CFD is a better-suited method to predict airflows in large indoor spaces coupled with complex multi-zone buildings. than are the zonal methods.

The simulations are carried out by dividing the process in a large number of quasi-static steps. In each quasi-static step. steady-state natural convection in the liquid phase is calculated by directly solving the governing equations of motion with a finite difference technique. This is used to predict the shape and motion of the solid-liquid boundary at the beginning of the next step. The predictions are found to be in good agreement with experiment.

EC is based on the rapid in situ dissolution of a sacrificial Fe(0) anode to generate iron precipitates with a high arsenic sorption affinity. We used X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate the local coordination environment (<4.0 Å) of Fe and As in EC precipitates generated in synthetic Bangladesh groundwater (SBGW).

Over 50 countries participating in the program have used the guidelines. which have been refined to reflect their comments. The guidelines delineate a step-wise methodology for evaluating greenhouse gas mitigation options for the energy and non-energy sectors and describe the applications of common analytical tools. The US Country Studies Program uses these guidelines in conjunction with intensive training workshops and follow up technical assistance during the lifetime of each country's study. The program uses similar reference materials to assist counties with their greenhouse gas emission inventories and evaluations of climate change vulnerability and adaptive responses. These guidelines serve three purposes: to assist countries in making decisions about the scope and methodology for mitigation assessments; to provide countries with guidance and step-by-step instructions on each element of a mitigation assessment; and to help countries determine which analytical tools are best suited to their needs and describe procedures for applying these tools.

Focussing on the UK Government's policy for a low carbon transition. the paper provides a conceptual language with which to describe and assess the geographical implications of a transition towards low carbon energy. Six concepts are introduced and explained: location. landscape. territoriality. spatial differentiation. scaling. and spatial embeddedness. Examples illustrate how the geographies of a future low-carbon economy are not yet determined and that a range of divergent – and …,True,uT560ZwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,873,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512009512,11495062430021478160,/scholar?cites=11495062430021478160,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512009512,0,0,0

1166037,Modelling transport energy demand: A socio-technical approach,2012,Jillian Anable and Christian Brand and Martino Tran and Nick Eyre,41,Energy policy,,125-138,Elsevier,Despite an emerging consensus that societal energy consumption and related emissions are not only influenced by technical efficiency but also by lifestyles and socio-cultural factors. few attempts have been made to operationalise these insights in models of energy demand. This paper addresses that gap by presenting a scenario exercise using an integrated suite of sectoral and whole systems models to explore potential energy pathways in the UK transport sector. Techno-economic driven scenarios are contrasted with one in which social change is strongly influenced by concerns about energy use. the environment and well-being. The ‘what if’ Lifestyle scenario reveals a future in which distance travelled by car is reduced by 74% by 2050 and final energy demand from transport is halved compared to the reference case.

USA.,More than 50% of the global population already lives in urban settlements and urban areas are projected to absorb almost all the global population growth to 2050. amounting to some additional three billion people. Over the next decades the increase in rural population in many developing countries will be overshadowed by population flows to cities. Rural populations globally are expected to peak at a level of 3.5 billion people by around 2020 and decline thereafter. albeit with heterogeneous regional trends. This adds urgency in addressing rural energy access. but our common future will be predominantly urban. Most of urban growth will continue to occur in small-to medium-sized urban centers. Growth in these smaller cities poses serious policy challenges. especially in the developing world. In small cities. data and information to guide policy are largely absent. local resources to tackle development challenges are limited. and governance and institutional capacities are weak. requiring serious efforts in capacity building. novel applications of remote sensing. information. and decision support techniques. and new institutional partnerships. While'megacities' with more than 10 million inhabitants have distinctive challenges. their contribution to global urban growth will remain comparatively small.Energy-wise. the world is already predominantly urban.

Traditional approaches to energy reduction look at direct emissions savings. and recommend insulation and efficiency as more cost-effective than microgeneration. However. microgeneration has indirect. ‘soft’ benefits and could play a significant role in emissions reduction. Current uptake of microgeneration in the UK is low. with various barriers—economic. technical. cultural. behavioural and institutional—both to uptake and to maximising energy and emissions savings once installed. Subsidies and spreading information alone do not guarantee maximising uptake. and even if successful. this is not enough to maximise savings.

Although some impacts cannot be valued. important conclusions are possible. This paper outlines some provisional implications for energy policy.

It is also well established that levels of energy efficiency are below the optimum for economic efficiency. i.e. there are market barriers to energy efficiency. Neo-c1assical economic theory provides a taxonomy of the barriers in terms of market failure and can evaluate short term policy options to address them. However. this paradigm does not explain the underlying causes or why all the market failures act in the direction of lower energy efficiency. Economic analysis alone cannot identify long term. sustainable approaches to removing the barriers; input is needed from other disciplines.

The challenge is difficult because of an inefficient building stock and high penetration of natural gas. We present new quantified scenarios for residential energy use in the UK to 2050. With minimal policy intervention the UK will remain locked into a gas based heating system. which would conflict with the policy goal of decarbonisation.

Tradable obligations on energy companies can achieve these goals. This paper outlines the experience of such obligations in three major European countries. Market liberalization in European countries led to new formal regulatory structures at the same time as concerns about energy security and climate change were growing. The UK. Italy and France all chose to address these challenges. in part. through tradable obligations. However. different national priorities and different energy market structures led to a variety of policy designs. This paper outlines these different designs. including the ‘governance approach’(responsibility for regulation and administration). obligated parties. scope. scale and tradable commodity. It identifies the expected. and currently observed. outcomes-both quantitative and qualitative changes to energy markets. It comments on some key issues. including the impact of different energy market structure on regulatory choices and their outcomes. the importance of monitoring and evaluation and the effectiveness of the markets for trading.

PCT is a policy invention. i.e. a policy that does not yet exist anywhere and therefore is perceived as risky by many. It faces more barriers than ‘conventional’ new policies. Obstacles to PCT are examined at the policy stages of agenda-setting. problem definition. and policy decision.

The analysis is based on an Input–Output (IO) table and Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for the year 2003–04 that distinguishes 25 sectors and 10 household classes. Total emissions of the Indian economy in 2003–04 are estimated to be 1217 million tons (MT) of CO2. of which 57% is due to the use of coal and lignite. The per capita emissions turn out to be about 1.14 tons. The highest direct emissions are due to electricity sector followed by manufacturing. steel and road transportation.

Alternative scenarios are developed for 2005. The I-O model considers structural changes in aggregate consumption behaviour and sectoral composition of output between 1990 and 2005.

Under ambitious poverty reduction targets. the annual growth rate of CO2 emissions increases from 4.8% to 5.9%. However. energy efficiency programmes could reduce the average annual growth rate of CO2 emissions back to 4.9%.

1166065,Economic development in Orissa: Growth without inclusion?,2012,Manoj K Panda,,,,,,The economy of Orissa has been lagging behind the national economy by several decades. Its per capita net state domestic product. a measure of average income. stood at Rs.20200 for 2006-07 which falls behind the national average by about 35 per cent. Moreover. the gross domestic product of the state grew by a considerable lower rate than many other states for a long time despite its high growth potential. Drawing on the experience of several countries as well as that of India. various studies concluded that economic growth was the most critical factor for reduction of incidence of poverty in the state. It now seems that there has been a turning point in the last few years and the economy of Orissa has witnessed an acceleration in terms of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). The evidence presented here clearly shows that the economy is poised for a take-off to a high growth phase. almost similar to that at the national level. On the poverty dimension. however. the recent developments have been gloomy. to say the least. The consumption expenditure surveys carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). the standard source of data for poverty analysis in India by official and non-official investigators. shows that the period 1993-2004 has witnessed a reversal of the achievements made on the poverty front during 1983-93.

The results show that the gross domestic product (GDP) growth and income-poverty reduction projected to occur following trade liberalization do not necessarily improve the food security and/or nutritional status of the poor. Evidence from simulations of (partial) trade reforms reflecting a possible Doha-like scenario show that the bottom 30 percent of the population in both rural and urban areas would suffer a decline in calorie and protein intake. in contrast to the rest of the population. even as all households increase their intake of fats. The food security/nutritional status outcome with regard to individual nutrients depends crucially on movements in the relative prices of different commodities along with changes in income levels. These results show that trade policy analysis should consider indicators of food security in addition to the overall growth and poverty measures traditionally considered in such studies.,True,qA1osPUAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,43,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=KV7SYBNFFsIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:ZEsoEUJyf6UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MpO4NEfccP&sig=J06wdLs73VfVwEzZK_M1DZUAeNw,11925375966381624164,/scholar?cites=11925375966381624164,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=KV7SYBNFFsIC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&dq=info:ZEsoEUJyf6UJ:scholar.google.com&ots=MpO4NEfccP&sig=J06wdLs73VfVwEzZK_M1DZUAeNw,0,0,0

1166074,Growth and poverty in Maharashtra,2006,Srijit Mishra and Manoj Panda,1,,,,Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research,Maharashtra is among the richest states in India in terms of per capita income. yet incidence of poverty in the state remains close to the national average. The state’s economy grew at a faster rate than the all-India average during 1980-1 to 1992-3. but it slowed down a bit during 1993-4 to 2003-4 due to poorer performance of agriculture and industry. Agriculture’s contribution to GSDP has come down to 12 per cent in 2002-3. but more than 50 per cent of total workers are still engaged in this. Cropping pattern has been shifting to greater value addition non-cereal crops like fruits. vegetables. oilseeds and sugarcane. Composition of manufacturing has shifted towards more capital-intensive sectors. Communication. transport and public administration have accounted for large part of service growth. The benefits of this growth process have. however. not spread equally across social groups or regions. which partly explains prevalence of high poverty compared to other states at similar mean income. The much talked about Maharashtra Employment Guarantee Scheme (MEGS) has had limited success and its coverage across districts/divisions is not proportionate to the share of poor. Despite these developments. rural poverty has reduced from 38 per cent in 1993-4 to around 24 per cent in 1999-2000. Given current investment flows. the overall growth potential of Maharashtra does look bright for the medium run. But. distributional implications of the emerging growth pattern across sectors suggest that the poor might not benefit proportionately from the growth process.

1166083,Policy dilemmas in India: The impact of changes in agricultural prices on rural and urban poverty,2008,Sandra Polaski and Manoj Panda and Anand Ganesh-Kumar and Scott McDonald and Sherman Robinson,,,,,,Trade policy reforms which lead to changes in world prices of agricultural commodities or domestic policies aimed at affecting agricultural prices are often seen as causing a policy dilemma: a fall in agricultural prices benefits poor urban consumers but hurts poor rural producers. while a rise yields the converse. Poor countries have argued that they need to be able to use import protection and/or price support policies to protect themselves against volatility in world agricultural prices in order to dampen these effects. In this paper. we explore this dilemma in a CGE model of India that uses a new social accounting matrix (SAM) developed at the Indira Ghandi Institute of Development Research (IGIDR) in Mumbai. The SAM includes extensive disaggregation of agricultural activities. commodity markets. labor markets. and rural and urban households. This SAM includes 115 commodities. 48 labor types and 352 types of households.(classified by social group. income class. region. and urban/rural). The CGE model based on this SAM can be used to explore the linkages between changes in world prices of agriculture and the incomes of poor rural and urban households. capturing rural-urban linkages in both commodity and factor markets. The results indicate that the inclusion of linkages between rural and urban labor markets is necessary to fully explore. and potentially eliminate. the dilemma. A fall in agricultural prices hurts agricultural producers. lowers wages and/or employment of rural labor. and in some cases spills over into urban labor markets. depressing wages and incomes of poor urban households as well. In these cases both rural and urban …,True,qA1osPUAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,10,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=2797,6369779206291282312,/scholar?cites=6369779206291282312,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/3877.pdf,0,0,0
1166084,Reforms in Indian agro-processing and agriculture sectors in the context of unilateral and multilateral trade agreements,2012,Anand Ganesh Kumar and Manoj K Panda and Mary E Burfisher,,,,,,In this paper. we explore the potential impacts of trade and investment-related policy reforms on India’s agro-processing sector. We consider the direct effects of policy reforms within the processing sector. and the indirect effects on agro-processing of policy reforms in the primary agriculture sector. in the Indian economy as a whole. and in a multilateral framework. Towards this. we develop a 22-sector. 16-region version of the GTAP computable general equilibrium (CGE). global model for our analysis. We find that trade and investment-related reforms in agro-processing together can help the sector to grow. Policy reforms that stimulate investment and help to improve productivity will be crucial in offsetting the contractionary pressures of trade reform alone on the production of processed agricultural products. We also find that indirect effects on agro-processing from India’s policy reforms in other sectors are more important than reforms in agro-processing itself. Our findings argue for an economy-wide perspective when targeting reform or development of the agro-processing sector in India. Compared to trade reform. comprehensive domestic reforms in the agro-processing and agriculture sectors relating to investment are critical for achieving growth in agro-processing. However. while the impacts of trade reform per se seem to be small. trade reform - by ushering in a higher degree of competition - could itself be a stimulus for investment and productivity gains in India. At present. unilateral reforms. especially those that improve productivity in agro-processing and in primary agriculture. are more important to agro-processing than multilateral trade …,True,qA1osPUAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,9,http://oii.igidr.ac.in:8080/xmlui/handle/2275/42,14146103667299564550,/scholar?cites=14146103667299564550,,http://oii.igidr.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2275/42/WP-2006-011.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1166085,Macroeconomic Overview,2008,Manoj Panda,,India Development Report,,,,There have been several interesting developments in the Indian economy in recent years. Substantial market friendly reforms initiated in 1991 created a favourable economic environment for high rates of growth in the economy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown between 7.4 and 9.4 per cent for four successive years in a row since 2003–4 and its growth in 2007–8 is likely to be along the same trajectory. This fascinating aggregate growth makes India currently the second highest growing economy in the world. next only to China. The pessimism that prevailed during the period 1997–2002 about the economy’s growth rate being stuck at a moderate level of 5–6 per cent has been replaced by a new optimism for a higher growth. Exports have surpassed the target and foreign demand has contributed substantially to the GDP acceleration—reflecting greater integration of the Indian economy with the world economy. Despite the strong upward pressure in international oil prices. inflation has been moderate but for certain short periods and the balance of payment position has remained comfortable. New policy initiatives have been undertaken to introduce fiscal discipline. specially at the state level. Another major step has been the enactment of the Rural Employment Guarantee Act which. if implemented properly. could substantially benefit the poor. Yet. there is a disquieting feeling that the growth process has not benefited all sections of the people.

Currently natural gas accounts for 7% of the primary energy consumption of India. The Government of India has its commitment to food security and energy security. The policies are directed toward greater allocation of natural gas on a priority basis to fertilizer and the power sector. Natural gas is the main and preferred feedstock for urea manufacture. This paper analyzes and estimates projected demand of natural gas in the next two decades. The demand projections have been reviewed in the context of changing government policies …,True,F13ilOQAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,16,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544209000590,3345500478626274025,/scholar?cites=3345500478626274025,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chandrashekhar_Singh3/publication/245076793_Natural_Gas_requirement_by_fertilizer_sector_in_India/links/5ae037a9aca272fdaf8bd510/Natural-Gas-requirement-by-fertilizer-sector-in-India.pdf,0,0,0

1166119,Excitation Cross-section Evaluation for the Lowest Auto-ionizing State of Potassium,2012,E Jobunga and J Okumu and CS Singh,7,The African Review of Physics,,,,The accuracy and reliability of any theoretical scattering model relies on the wave functions used and the energy of the projectile. Perturbation methods are known to be accurate at intermediate and high energies of the incident projectile but this accuracy also depend on the distortion potentials employed and the consideration given to higher order terms and the exchange effects. In a distorted wave model the initial state distorted wave is generated by the static potential of the target atom in the initial state and the final state distorted wave is generated by a potential taken as the sum of one-half of the initial state static potential and one-half of the final state static potential of the target atom. We used this model to evaluate the integral and differential crosssections as well as alignment and lambda parameters for electron-impact excitation of the lowest auto-ionizing states of K in the energy range of 18-1000 eV. The wave functions employed are the multi-zeta Hartree-Fock single electron wave functions. The numerical calculations are performed using DWBA1 program. which we modified to evaluate the exchange amplitudes exactly without any approximation. We have compared our results with other known theoretical and experimental results.

Based on certain theoretical considerations multivariate functional models (MFMs) are developed to estimate methane mitigation and energy generating potential of the proposed system. Comparison was made between the existing waste management system and proposed PBLF system. It has been found that the proposed methodology not only controlled methane emissions to the atmosphere but also could yield considerable energy in terms of landfill gas (LFG). Economic feasibility of the proposed system has been tested by comparing unit cost of waste disposal in conventional as well as PBLF systems.

A peculiarity of electronic waste is that it has a ‘significant’ value even after its life time. and to add complication. even after its extended life in its ‘dump’ stage. Thus. in Indian situations. after its life time is over. the e-material changes hands more than once and finally ends up either in the hands of informal recyclers or in the store rooms of urban dwellings.

The group aggregation (GA) methods and their correctness were tested while prioritizing the alternative options to achieve energy efficient and less polluting transport system in Delhi It was observed that among all group aggregation methods. geometric mean method (GMM) - the most widely adopted GA method of AHP - showed poor performance and failed to satisfy the most popular pareto optimality and non-dictatorship axiom raising questions on its validity as GA method adopted in AHP. All other group aggregation methods viz. weighted arithmetic mean method with varying weights and equal weights (WAMM. WeAMM) and arithmetic mean of individual priorities (AMM) resulted in concurring results with the individual member priorities. This study demonstrates that WeAMM resulted in better aggregation of individual priorities compared to WAMM. Comparative analysis between individual and group priorities demonstrates that the arithmetic mean (AMM) of priorities by individual members of the group showed minimum deviation from the group consensus making it the most suitable and simple method to aggregate individual preferences to arrive at a group consensus.,True,SRQ0-OgAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,18,https://ideas.repec.org/p/eab/microe/22400.html,3347889292358544416,/scholar?cites=3347889292358544416,,,0,0,0

In an earlier study to find a suitable adsorbent to remove endosulfan. wood charcoal was found to give promising results. In the present study. the process controlling the rate of endosulfan sorption onto wood charcoal and the mechanism of removal were examined using various methodologies. Both film and pore diffusion coefficients were determined. and the linearity of the rate constants of adsorption with initial endosulfan concentrations revealed the process to be controlled by film diffusion. This was supported by the linear fit of the rate constants with the inverse of the diameter of adsorbent particles and the change in adsorption rates with agitation speed.

For instance. cities with less development face lack of sanitation facilities resulting in unhygienic conditions and spread of infectious diseases. With increasing economic growth such problems slowly disappear. giving rise to different problems like industrial pollution and air pollution. As the growth rate furthers environmental problems transform into rich life style problems like higher energy use and increased waste generation and the related problems. Many developed cities in Asia have undergone these stages and cities are facing different kind of environmental problems according to their respective economic growth levels.However. with the increasing awareness for environment and the related problem. it should be possible to leapfrog certain environmental problems in the course of the. economic developing by learning from the cities. which have already experienced those problems. City planners should be made aware of such trends of environmental dynamics and be helped with the measures to leapfrog some of the environmental problems that they may face in the due course of their development.

They have contributed least to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) but they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This is due to their location in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world and their low capacities to adapt to these changes. Adaptation to climate change has become an important policy priority in the international negotiations on climate change in recent years. However. it has yet to become a major policy issue within developing countries. especially the LDCs. This article focuses on two LDCs. namely Bangladesh and Mali. where progress has been made regarding identifying potential adaptation options. For example. Bangladesh already has effective disaster response systems. and strategies to deal with reduced freshwater availability. and Mali has a well-developed programme for …,True,6FYIdSQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,546,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14693062.2004.9685508,8610022334334024520,/scholar?cites=8610022334334024520,,http://lib.riskreductionafrica.org/bitstream/handle/123456789/452/3897.Mainstreaming%20adaptation%20to%20climate%20change%20in%20Least%20Developed%20Countries%20%28LDCs%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Yet evidence shows that some of the most adverse effects of climate change will be in developing countries. where populations are most vulnerable and least likely to easily adapt to climate change. and that climate change will affect the potential for development in these countries. Some synergies already exist between climate change policies and the sustainable development agenda in developing countries. such as energy efficiency. renewable energy. transport and sustainable land-use policies.

While attention has been understandably focussed on the ratification process. it is time to begin thinking about the next steps for the global climate regime. particularly in terms of a deeper inclusion of developing countries' concerns and interests. This paper begins doing so from the perspective of the developing countries. The principal argument is that we need to return to the basic principles outlined in the Framework Convention on Climate Change in searching for a north—south bargain on climate change. Such a bargain may be achievable if we can realign the policy architecture of the climate regime to its original stated goals of sustainable development.,True,6FYIdSQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,262,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3763/cpol.2003.0329,9964145031625308308,/scholar?cites=9964145031625308308,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44499411/Najam_20-_20Climate_20Negotiations_20Beyond_20Kyoto_20Developing.pdf,0,0,0

Although climate change seems marginal compared to the pressing issues of poverty alleviation and economic development. it is becoming clear that the realisation of development goals may be hampered by climate change. However. development can be shaped in such a way as to achieve its goals and at the same time reduce vulnerability to climate change. thereby facilitating sustainable development that realises economic. social. local and global environmental goals. This approach has been coined the ‘development first approach’. in which a future climate regime should focus on development strategies with ancillary climate benefits and increase the capability of developing countries to implement these.

Science has made progress in understanding major issues and proximate causes of dryland degradation such that indicator sets can be accordingly selected from the wealth of existing and documented indicator systems.

1166170,Widening energy access in Africa: Towards energy transition,2012,Youba Sokona and Yacob Mulugetta and Haruna Gujba,47,Energy Policy,,3-10,Elsevier,The discussion to widen access to modern energy services has been influential in shaping some of the discussions on energy at the international level. The practice of widening modern energy services access to the poor in Africa is complex. and exacerbated by the dual nature of the energy system across Sub-Saharan Africa where traditional and modern energy systems and practices co-exist.

The importance of heating and cooling in total building energy use is very diverse with this share varying between 18% and 73%. Biomass is still far the dominant fuel when a global picture is considered; the role of electricity is substantially growing. and the direct use of coal is disappearing from this sector. largely replaced by electricity and natural gas in the most developed regions.

Buildings and activities in buildings are responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions. but they are also the key to mitigation strategies. In 2010. the building sector accounted for approximately 117 Exajoules (EJ) or 32% of global final energy consumption and 19% of energy-related CO2 emissions; and 51% of global electricity consumption. Buildings contribute to a significant amount of F-gas emissions. with large differences in reported figures due to differing accounting conventions. ranging from around an eighth to a third of all such emissions. The chapter argues that beyond a large emission role. mitigation opportunities in this sector are also significant. often very cost-effective. and are in many times associated with significant co-benefits that can exceed the direct benefits by orders of magnitude. The sector has significant mitigation potentials at low or even negative costs. Nevertheless. without strong actions emissions are likely to grow considerably - and they may even double by mid-century - due to several drivers. The chapter points out that certain policies have proven to be very effective and several new ones are emerging. As a result. building energy use trends have been reversed to stagnation or even reduction in some jurisdictions in recent years. despite the increases in affluence and population.

Acknowledging this gap. this paper explores the mainstream academic and policy literatures to provide a taxonomy of interactions and identify synergies and trade-offs between them. The most important trade-off identified is the potential increase in energy poverty levels as a result of strong climate change action if the internalisation of the external costs of carbon emissions is not offset by efficiency gains. The most significant synergy was found in deep energy efficiency in buildings. The paper argues that neither of the two problems – deep reductions in GHG emissions by mid-century. and energy poverty eradication – is likely to be solved fully on their own merit. while joining the two policy goals may provide a very …,True,6CjZDSYAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,198,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421511009918,12432162047289190998,/scholar?cites=12432162047289190998,,https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3949440/mod_resource/content/1/energy%20and%20poverty%20alleviation.pdf,0,0,0

Globally. the energy use for heating and cooling by the middle of the century will be between 45 and 59 exajoules per year (corresponding to an increase of 7–40% since 2010). Most of this variability is due to the uncertainty in future urban densities of rapidly growing cities in Asia and particularly China. Dense urban development leads to less urban energy use overall.

Buildings and activities in buildings are responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions. but they are also the key to mitigation strategies. In 2010. the building sector accounted for approximately 117 Exajoules (EJ) or 32% of global final energy consumption and 19% of energy-related CO2 emissions; and 51% of global electricity consumption. Buildings contribute to a significant amount of F-gas emissions. with large differences in reported figures due to differing accounting conventions. ranging from around an eighth to a third of all such emissions. The chapter argues that beyond a large emission role. mitigation opportunities in this sector are also significant. often very cost-effective. and are in many times associated with significant co-benefits that can exceed the direct benefits by orders of magnitude. The sector has significant mitigation potentials at low or even negative costs. Nevertheless. without strong actions emissions are likely to grow considerably - and they may even double by mid-century - due to several drivers. The chapter points out that certain policies have proven to be very effective and several new ones are emerging. As a result. building energy use trends have been reversed to stagnation or even reduction in some jurisdictions in recent years. despite the increases in affluence and population.

During the 30 years of the Brazilian Alcohol Program. Brazil has accumulated a significant amount of experience in the various aspects of sugarcane ethanol production. This paper discusses this experience and the lessons learned. with special attention paid to the following aspects: (1) private investments now fund alcohol mill construction. eliminating the need for subsidies or other government incentives (so there is no influence of the sunk capital investments made in the past). and it is competitive with gasoline without the need for government subsidies to the industry; (2) the favorable …,True,cjchjWcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,141,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973082608605293,2770147010319755002,/scholar?cites=2770147010319755002,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39180806/54d22c470cf28959aa7c2d05.pdf,0,0,0

In addition to the environmental and strategic benefits to be derived from replacing fossil fuels with biofuels. particularly in the transportation and the energy sectors. their production and trade can bring about significant social benefits due to the perspectives of job creation mainly in rural areas of developing countries. The experience of the Alcohol Programme in Brazil is a positive example of such gains. However. despite all these advantages. developed countries are placing high barriers in the way of the international trade of biofuels. South-North and South-South biofuels trade is important for producers of biofuels in developing countries such as South Africa. India. China and Brazil (or potential biofuel producers). as it could contribute to the sustainable development of these countries. as well as provide environmental benefits to developed countries in the context of the global efforts to combat climate change.,True,cjchjWcAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,84,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.613.3127&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6029125881305533484,/scholar?cites=6029125881305533484,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.613.3127&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In the first edition of this book. Professor Goldemberg pioneered the study of all three elements in relation to one another. With contributions from Oswaldo Lucon. this second edition has been expanded and updated to cover how energy is related to the major challenges of sustainability faced by the world today. The book starts by conceptualizing energy. and then relates it to human activities. to existing natural resources and to development indicators. It then covers the main environmental problems. their causes and possible solutions. Disaggregating national populations by income and by how different income groups consume energy. the authors identify the differences between local. regional and global environmental impacts. and can thus ascertain who is responsible for them. Finally. they discuss general and specific policies to promote sustainable development in energy. New coverage is included of today's pressing issues. including security. environmental impact assessment and future climate change/renewable energy regimes. The authors also cover all major new international agreements and technological developments. Energy.

It can reach isolated areas without significant infrastructure investments. can be stored safely and can provide the basic services for the most needy. such as heating. cooking and lighting. Imported LPG had a very significant role in Brazil in the 20th century. when continent-scale distribution logistics were established. supplying the fuel to households at subsidized prices. In 2001. the subsidies were removed. correcting price distortions but creating even worse social and environmental problems.

The new IPCC report makes clear that humankind plays a dominant role on climate change due to CO2 emissions from energy consumption. and that a significant reduction in CO2 emissions is necessary within decades. At the same time. the supply of fossil energy sources like coal. oil. and natural gas becomes less reliable. In spring 2008. the oil price rose beyond 100$/barrel for the first time in history. It is commonly accepted today that we have to reduce the use of fossil fuels to cut down the dependency on the supply countries and to reduce CO2 emissions.

The importance of heating and cooling in total building energy use is very diverse with this share varying between 18% and 73%.

Several cubicles were constructed and their thermal performance throughout the time was measured. For each construction material. macroencapsulated PCM is added in one cubicle (RT-27 and SP-25 A8). The cubicles have a domestic heat pump as a cooling system and the energy consumption is registered to determine the energy savings achieved. The free-floating experiments show that the PCM can reduce the peak temperatures up to 1 °C and smooth out the daily fluctuations. Moreover. in summer 2008 the electrical energy consumption was reduced in the PCM cubicles about 15%.

Buildings and activities in buildings are responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions. but they are also the key to mitigation strategies. In 2010. the building sector accounted for approximately 117 Exajoules (EJ) or 32% of global final energy consumption and 19% of energy-related CO2 emissions; and 51% of global electricity consumption. Buildings contribute to a significant amount of F-gas emissions. with large differences in reported figures due to differing accounting conventions. ranging from around an eighth to a third of all such emissions. The chapter argues that beyond a large emission role. mitigation opportunities in this sector are also significant. often very cost-effective. and are in many times associated with significant co-benefits that can exceed the direct benefits by orders of magnitude. The sector has significant mitigation potentials at low or even negative costs. Nevertheless. without strong actions emissions are likely to grow considerably - and they may even double by mid-century - due to several drivers. The chapter points out that certain policies have proven to be very effective and several new ones are emerging. As a result. building energy use trends have been reversed to stagnation or even reduction in some jurisdictions in recent years. despite the increases in affluence and population.

These materials are used in applications where it is necessary to store energy due to the temporary phase shift between the offer and demand of thermal energy. Thus. possible applications are the solar systems as well as the recovery of residual heat for its posterior use in other processes. In spite of this great potential. the practical feasibility of latent heat storage with PCM is still limited. mainly due to a rather low thermal conductivity. This low conductivity implies small heat transfer coefficients and. consequently. thermal cycles are slow and not suitable for most of the potential applications.This work investigates experimentally the heat transfer process during melting (charge) and solidification (discharge) of five small heat exchangers working as latent heat thermal storage …,True,h9Ev4vYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,383,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030626190900021X,5336488628867121214,/scholar?cites=5336488628867121214,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48959726/Experimental_evaluation_of_commercial_he20160919-3006-1isvtkh.pdf,0,0,0

Free-cooling is understood as a means to store outdoors coolness during the night. to supply indoors cooling during the day. The use of PCMs is suitable because of the small temperature difference between day indoors and night outdoors. An installation that allows testing the performance of PCMs in such systems was designed and constructed. The main influence parameters like ratio of energy/volume in the encapsulates. load/unload rate of the storage. and cost of the installation were determined. and experiments were performed following the design of experiments strategy.

Heat and cold stores can basically be divided in two groups. In sensible heat stores the temperature of the storage material is increased significantly. Latent heat stores. on the contrary. use a storage material that undergoes a phase change (PCM) and a small temperature rise is sufficient to store heat or cold. The major advantages of the phase change stores are their large heat storage capacity and their isothermal behavior during the charging and discharging process. However. while unloading a latent heat storage. the solid–liquid interface moves away from the heat transfer surface and the heat flux decreases due to the increasing thermal resistance of the growing layer of the molten/solidified medium.

In spite of its high potential. industrial waste heat (IWH) is currently underutilized. This may be due. on one hand. to the technical and economic difficulties in applying conventional heat recovery methods and. on the other. the temporary or geographical mismatch between the energy released and its heat demand.

Due to the high cost of fossil fuels and to the necessity to reduce CO2 emissions. and also due to the new building regulations more attention is paid to the insulation of buildings. Different insulation materials are available in the market. Usually. they are compared by their thermal conductivity and with theoretical calculations. but there are no experimental comparisons available. where the behavior of such insulation materials in a building is compared over time.

This effect is known as thermal stratification. and has been studied experimentally thoughtfully. This system stores sensible heat in water for short term applications. Adding PCM (phase change material) modules at the top of the water tank would give the system a higher storage density and compensate heat loss in the top layer because of the latent heat of PCM. Tests were performed under real operating conditions in a complete solar heating system that was constructed at the University of Lleida. Spain.

Buildings and activities in buildings are responsible for a significant share of GHG emissions. but they are also the key to mitigation strategies. In 2010. the building sector accounted for approximately 117 Exajoules (EJ) or 32% of global final energy consumption and 19% of energy-related CO2 emissions; and 51% of global electricity consumption. Buildings contribute to a significant amount of F-gas emissions. with large differences in reported figures due to differing accounting conventions. ranging from around an eighth to a third of all such emissions. The chapter argues that beyond a large emission role. mitigation opportunities in this sector are also significant. often very cost-effective. and are in many times associated with significant co-benefits that can exceed the direct benefits by orders of magnitude. The sector has significant mitigation potentials at low or even negative costs. Nevertheless. without strong actions emissions are likely to grow considerably - and they may even double by mid-century - due to several drivers. The chapter points out that certain policies have proven to be very effective and several new ones are emerging. As a result. building energy use trends have been reversed to stagnation or even reduction in some jurisdictions in recent years. despite the increases in affluence and population.

In some countries a large number of ESCOs have been successfully operating for a number of years. while in other countries only a few ESCOs have recently started to operate. This difference could be explained by several factors. such as different levels of support offered to ESCOs by national and regional energy authorities. local market structures and rules. and variation in the definitions. roles and activities of ESCOs.

European Union,,,,Electricity consumption in the EU-27 Member States and Candidate Countries has continued to grow in the last years despite numerous energy efficiency polices and programmes at EU and national level. Total electricity consumption in the residential sector in the EU-25 has grown by 10.8% in the period 1999-2004. at almost the same rate as the economy (GDP). Similar trends are also observed in the tertiary sector and to a lesser extend in industry. The electricity consumption in the tertiary sector has grown by 15.6% in the period 1999-2004 and by 2.0% in the period 2003-2004. Despite this increase and the consequent impact on CO2 emissions. there is little knowledge at European level. where the electricity is uses. what is the status of efficiency of the installed and sold equipment and what is the likely impact of the past. present and planned policies. For the tertiary sector there is even much less data available for individual electricity end-uses than for the residential sector. and only a few sources or countries attempted to split the total electricity consumption among the different end-uses.The energy consumption of the industrial sector has continued to grow in the period 1999 to 2004 in the EU-25 with an increase of 6.6%. while the yearly growth rate in the period 2003-2004 has been 1. 3.

The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector including data centres generates up to 2% of the global CO 2 emissions. a number on par to the aviation sector contribution. and data centres are estimated to have the fastest growing carbon footprint from across the whole ICT sector. mainly due to technological advances such as the cloud computing and the rapid growth of the use of Internet services. There are no recent estimations of the total energy consumption of the European data centre and of their energy efficiency. The aim of this paper is to evaluate. analyse and present the current trends in energy consumption and efficiency in data centres in the European Union using the data submitted by companies participating in the European Code of Conduct for Data Centre Energy Efficiency programme. a voluntary initiative created in 2008 in response to the increasing energy consumption in data centres and the need to reduce the related environmental. economic and energy supply security impacts. The analysis shows that the average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of the facilities participating in the programme is declining year after year. This confirms that voluntary approaches could be effective in addressing climate and energy issue.

Lighting was the first service offered by electric utilities and still continues to be one of the largest electrical end-uses. Most current lighting technologies can be vastly improved. and therefore lighting loads present a huge potential for electricity savings.Solid State Lighting (SSL) is amongst the most energy-efficient and environmentally friendly lighting technology. SSL has already reached a high efficiency level (over 276 lm/W) at ever-decreasing costs. Additionally the lifetime of LED lamps is several times longer than discharge lamps.

Typically 60-80% of the electricity which is used in the industrial sector and about 35% of the electricity used in the commercial sector in the European Union is consumed by motors. In industry. a motor consumes an annual quantity of electricity which corresponds to approximately 5 times its purchase price. throughout its whole life of aroun~ 12 to 20 years. Motors are by far the most important type of electric load. They are used in all sectors and in a wide range of applications. namely the following: fans. compressors. pumps. mills. winders. elevators. transports. home appliances. and office equipment. etc. It is their wide use that makes motor drive systems one of the main targets to achieve significant energy savings.

GDP. population or any other suitable variable. These can be termed as partial indicators as they consider emissions as a function of only one variable. Simultaneous consideration of more variables affecting carbon emissions is relatively complex. In this paper. several variables are simultaneously considered in comparing carbon emissions of countries using a new mathematical programming methodology. called the Data Envelopment Analysis. We have illustrated the use of the methodology with four variables representing CO2 emissions. energy consumption and economic activity. The illustrative analysis shows that Luxembourg. Norway.

We measure two indices of the relative impact of climate across countries. impact per capita. and impact per GDP. These measures sum market impacts across the climate-sensitive economic sectors of each country. Both indices reveal that climate change will have serious distributional impact across countries. grouped by income per capita. We predict that poor countries will suffer the bulk of the damages from climate change. Although adaptation. wealth. and technology may influence distributional consequences across countries. we argue that the primary reason that poor countries are so vulnerable is their location.

Using data from a survey of more than 9.000 farmers across 11 African countries. a cross-sectional approach estimates how farm net revenues are affected by climate change compared with current mean temperature. Revenues fall with warming for dryland crops (temperature elasticity of −1.9) and livestock (−5.4). whereas revenues rise for irrigated crops (elasticity of 0.5). which are located in relatively cool parts of Africa and are buffered by irrigation from the effects of warming. At first. warming has little net aggregate effect as the gains for irrigated crops offset the losses for dryland crops and livestock.

The effects of temperature and precipitation on net crop revenues are analyzed using cross‐sectional data consisting of both rainfed and irrigated farms. Based on survey data from 8.405 households across 28 provinces. the results suggest that global warming is likely to be harmful to rainfed farms but beneficial to irrigated farms.

1166320,Water pricing experiences: An international perspective,1997,Ariel Dinar and Ashok Subramanian,,,,,The World Bank,This report presents water pricing experiences across 22 countries in various sectors and over time. Country case studies provide a perspective of recent and future water pricing and water management issues. These studies show that countries have different reasons for charging for water. including cost recovery. redistribution of income. improvement of water allocation. and water conservation. Most countries are now gradually turning over management responsibilities of water supplies to private enterprises and nongovernmental organizations. Some countries are developing legal frameworks to decentralize water management. and encouraging the private sector to become involved through incentives. Still their water supply authorities have the power to set and adjust water rates. A large majority are implementing price schemes to recover operation and maintenance costs from users. and some are also recovering at least a portion of capital costs. Almost all country reports discuss the need for volumetric pricing. metering. moving away from uniform tariffs. and abolishing minimum prices. Many specify the need to significantly increase water charges to all users. The report identifies the development of formal transferable water rights and water markets as crucial issues to consider for managing water resources in the future. The report also recognizes the need to provide incentives to water suppliers and consumers. and the use of measuresto protect the environment. such as pollution taxes. Other price-related issues are mentioned such as pricing for irrigation water of different quality. adjusting charges to reflect regional differences in water …,True,mPkVIgEAAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC,323,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US2012419837,834958436993480178,/scholar?cites=834958436993480178,,,0,0,0
1166321,Markets for water: Potential and performance,1998,K William Easter Mark W Rosegrant and Ariel Dinar,15,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Markets for Water: Potential and Performance dispels many of the myths surrounding water markets and gives readers a comprehensive picture of the way that markets have developed in different parts of the world. It is possible. for example. for a water market to fail. and for the transaction costs in water markets to be excessive. Too often water trading is banned because the water resources have been developed with public funds and the water agencies do not want to lose control over water. There is also a concern that poor farmers or households will be disadvantaged by water trading. These concerns about public resources and the poor are not very different from those that have been voiced in the past about land sales. The problem is that in many cases the poor already have limited access to resources. but this limit is not due to water trading. In fact. water trading is likely to expand the access to water for many small-scale farmers. Markets for Water: Potential and Performance provides an analytical framework for water market establishment. It develops the necessary conditions for water markets and illustrates how they can improve both water management and economic efficiency.

Enhanced with a detailed and comprehensive index. Climate Change and Agriculture is highly recommended for academic library environmental studies and economic studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists. The Midwest Book Review Despite its great importance. there are surprisingly few economic studies of the impact of climate on agriculture and how agriculture can adapt under a variety of conditions. This book examines 22 countries across four continents. including both developed and developing economies. It provides both a good analytical basis for additional work and solid results for policy debate concerning income distributional effects such as abatement. adaptation. and equity. Agriculture and grazing are a central sector in the livelihood of many people. particularly in developing countries. This book uses the Ricardian method to examine the impact of climate change on agriculture. It also quantifies how farmers adapt to climate. The findings suggest that agriculture in developing countries is more sensitive to climate than agriculture in developed countries. Rain-fed cropland is generally more sensitive to warming than irrigated cropland and cropland is more sensitive than livestock. The adaptation to climate change results reveal that farmers make many adjustments including switching crops and livestock species. adopting irrigation. and moving between livestock and crops.

1166329,Economics of reservoir sedimentation and sustainable management of dams,2001,Alesssandro Palmieri and F Shah and A Dinar,61,Journal of environmental management,2,149-163,Academic Press,Accepted practice has been to design and operate reservoirs to fill with sediment. generating benefits from remaining storage over a finite period of time. The consequences of sedimentation and project abandonment are left to the future. This ‘future’ has already arrived for many existing reservoirs and most others will eventually experience a similar fate. thereby imposing substantial costs on society. Such costs could be avoided if sedimentation was minimized and dams were allowed to live forever. The fact that the world’s inventory of suitable reservoir sites is limited provides an additional reason for encouraging the sustainable management of dams. This paper provides a framework for assessing the economic feasibility of sediment management strategies that would allow the life of dams to be prolonged indefinitely.

Technology & Education,The aim of the present work is to evaluate the influence of La6W2O15 secondary phase on the properties and integrity of La6-xWO12-δ–based membranes. Structural. microstructural and thermo–chemical study was carried out evidencing significant crystallographic and thermal expansion anisotropy: the reason for poor thermo–mechanical stability of La6W2O15. Conductivity of La6W2O15 was one to two orders of magnitude lower compared to the phase pure La6-xWO12-δ in the range of 300 to 900 °C. The relaxation study showed that the hydration process was faster for the La6W2O15 compared to the LWO phase. due to the higher electronic contribution to the total conductivity. Short–term stability tests in H2 at 900 °C and in a mixture of CO2 and CH4 at 750 °C were conducted and material remained stable.

A 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2 (3YSZ) porous tubular support was manufactured by the freeze-casting technique. offering a hierarchical and radial-oriented porosity of about 15 µm in width. separated by fully densified walls of about 2 µm thick. suggesting low pressure drop and boosted gas transport. The external surface of the support was successively dip-coated to get a Ce 0.8 Gd 0.2 O 2− δ–5mol% Co (CGO-Co) interlayer of 80 µm in thickness and an outer dense layer of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3− δ (LSCF) with a thickness of 30 µm. The whole tubular membrane presents both uniform geometric characteristics and microstructure all along its length. Chemical reactivity between each layer was studied by coupling X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping at each step of the manufacturing process. Cation interdiffusion between different phases was discarded. confirming the compatibility of this tri-layer asymmetric ceramic membrane for oxygen production purposes. For the first time. a freeze-cast tubular membrane has been evaluated for oxygen permeation. exhibiting a value of 0.31 mL· min− 1· cm− 2 at 1000 C under air and argon as feed and sweep gases. respectively. Finally. under the same conditions and increasing the oxygen partial pressure to get pure oxygen as feed. the oxygen permeation reached 1.07 mL· min− 1· cm− 2.

The main feature of agents in these systems is autonomy. It is this autonomy that requires regulation. and norms are a solution for this. Norms represent a tool for achieving coordination and cooperation among the members of a society. They have been employed in the field of Artificial Intelligence as a formal specification of deontic statements aimed at regulating the actions of software agents and the interactions among them. This article gives an overview of the most relevant works on norms for multi-agent systems.

The application of holonic concepts to manufacturing was initially motivated by the inadequacy of existing manufacturing systems in the following two aspects: (i) dealing with the evolution of products within an existing production facility. and (ii) maintaining a satisfactory performance outside of normal operating conditions. In spite of the large number of developments reported in Holonic Control Architectures and Holonic Control Algorithms. there is very little work reported on Methodologies for HMS.

The training and testing sets of data used for the neural network studies were obtained by means of a combinatorial approach search. which employs an evolutionary optimization strategy.

An important problem for the performance of the Virtual Organization is the distribution of the agents across the computational resources. The final distribution should provide a good load balancing for the organization. In this article. a genetic algorithm is applied to calculate a proper distribution across hosts in an agent-based Virtual Organization. Additionally. an abstract multi-agent system architecture which provides infrastructure for Virtual Organization distribution is introduced. The developed genetic solution employs an elitist crossover operator where one of the children inherits the most promising genetic material from the parents with higher probability.

En la mayoría de las ocasiones. a pesar de que el dominio de búsqueda es finito. éste puede ser de dimensiones exponenciales. En la actualidad es posible solucionar un gran número de problemas combinatorios presentes en la vida real empleando técnicas basadas en programación entera.

Para estas ocasiones. los esfuerzos de investigación se han centrado en la aplicación de técnicas meta-heurísticas. En este último caso se enmarca el presente trabajo. es decir. en la resolución de problemas combinatorios complejos. de grandes dimensiones. donde explorar todas las posibilidades a fin de encontrar el óptimo es inabordable. ya sea por motivos económicos (probar cada combinación sea caro) o por motivos computacionales (temporalmente sea intratable).

To maintain the mechanical stability of the membrane. a supporting structure is needed. In this work magnesium oxide (MgO) is identified as support material for H2-separation membranes made of La6-xWO12-δ (LaWO). Therefore MgO is tested under application-related conditions in a water-gas-shift (WGS) catalytic membrane reactor for hydrogen production and shows a good stability. The sequential tape casting serves as the manufacturing method for the preparation of the asymmetric membrane structures. To show the compatibility of the two materials. detailed investigations of the sintering behaviour and stability tests are performed and show the well-matching properties of the two materials.

1166596,Synthesis of single-crystalline TiO2 nanotubes,2002,SM Liu and LM Gan and LH Liu and WD Zhang and HC Zeng,14,Chemistry of materials,3,1391-1397,American Chemical Society,In this work. we demonstrate experimentally that the classification of “inorganic fullerene-like structures” can be extended from transition metal sulfides to include metal oxides. Single-crystalline TiO2 nanotubes have been synthesized for the first time with an unconstrained solution growth method by hydrolyzing TiF4 under acidic condition at 60 °C. With SEM/HRTEM/XRD methods. it is found that the walls of TiO2 tubes are formed with stacking of {101} planes (anatase polymorph).

The transformation of the current fossil-fuel-based energy system to a more sustainable. renewable and cleaner alternative is desperately required to mitigate climate change. As a carbon-free and clean energy carrier. hydrogen has long been considered as a promising energy option. However. hydrogen does not exist naturally due to its inherently reactive features and has to be cost-effectively produced from hydrogen-containing compounds. Solar or electrochemically driven water splitting is an appealing vision for future sustainable hydrogen production.

1166637,Ice-Templating for the Elaboration of Oxygen Permeation Asymmetric Tubular Membrane with Radial Oriented Porosity,2019,Cyril Gaudillere and Julio Garcia-Fayos and Jorge Plaza and José M Serra,2,Ceramics,2,246-259,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,An original asymmetric tubular membrane for oxygen production applications was manufactured in a two-step process. A 3 mol% Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2 (3YSZ) porous tubular support was manufactured by the freeze-casting technique. offering a hierarchical and radial-oriented porosity of about 15 µm in width. separated by fully densified walls of about 2 µm thick. suggesting low pressure drop and boosted gas transport. The external surface of the support was successively dip-coated to get a Ce 0.8 Gd 0.2 O 2− δ–5mol% Co (CGO-Co) interlayer of 80 µm in thickness and an outer dense layer of La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3− δ (LSCF) with a thickness of 30 µm. The whole tubular membrane presents both uniform geometric characteristics and microstructure all along its length. Chemical reactivity between each layer was studied by coupling X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Energy Dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping at each step of the manufacturing process. Cation interdiffusion between different phases was discarded. confirming the compatibility of this tri-layer asymmetric ceramic membrane for oxygen production purposes. For the first time. a freeze-cast tubular membrane has been evaluated for oxygen permeation. exhibiting a value of 0.31 mL· min− 1· cm− 2 at 1000 C under air and argon as feed and sweep gases. respectively. Finally. under the same conditions and increasing the oxygen partial pressure to get pure oxygen as feed. the oxygen permeation reached 1.07 mL· min− 1· cm− 2.

1166638,Freeze-casting: Fabrication of highly porous and,2016,Cyril Gaudillere and José M Serra,,,,,,The manufacture of structured ceramic porous support knows an important boom since more than a decade with the development of new shaping techniques. Among the most promising ones. the freeze-casting also called Ice-Templating allows the fabrication of ceramic parts exhibiting high porosity (> 50%) and vertically aligned and hierarchically organized pores. Such structures were firstly conceived for biomedical applications like bone substitute and tissue engineering. but the distinctive features of freeze-cast structures have attracted the attention of diverse scientific fields. especially in high temperature ceramicbased energy production systems. Indeed. technologies like (a) Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Electrolyser Cell (SOEC).(b) gas separation (O2. H2) by asymmetric supported membranes based on mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIEC) or hydrogen-permeable metals. and (c) Catalytic Membrane Reactor (CMR) systems present a porous component in their physical structure. This latest. presenting a tortuous pathway for gas access and as a consequence. a high transport limitation. is known to be a limiting component for the operation at high flow streams that would enable to reach industrial target. The aim of this paper is to give an overview of the freeze-casting ceramic shaping method and to show how its implementation could be useful for several energy applications where key components comprise a porous scaffold. A detailed presentation of the freeze-casting process and of the characteristics of the resulting porous parts is firstly given.

For the purpose of minimizing concentration polarization in the support pores. the microstructure of these support-layers has been optimized. For that reason supports with a porosity of up to 41% were developed.

However. this reaction faces two major issues: The one-pass conversion is limited by thermodynamics. and the catalyst deactivates quickly through kinetically favored formation of coke. We show that integration of an electrochemical BaZrO3-based membrane exhibiting both proton and oxide ion conductivity into an MDA reactor gives rise to high aromatic yields and improved catalyst stability.

The oxidation. as measured bythermogravimetry. was approximately parabolic. The oxidescales could be divided in two main regions: An outerregion consisting of copper oxides and an inner porousregion. which consists of Cu2O with dispersedNiO particles. NiO particles exists as internal-oxide particles. The interface between the two layersreflects the original surface. which shows that theouter part grows by outward Cu diffusion via vacancies.The inner part grows by outward diffusion of copper and inward transport of gaseous oxygen by thedissociative-transport mechanism.

Doping LaNbO 4 on both A and B site (with Ca and Ti. respectively) resulted in a two-phase composition of LaNbO 4 and LaNb 3 O 9.

The electrical characterisation of Ti-doped LaNbO 4 revealed mixed electronic (n-and p-type) and ionic conductivity at temperatures above approx. 750° C. while proton conductivity was dominating below this temperature under wet conditions.

A sweep gas method was employed. Results indicate that in the range of thickness 0.057–0.215 cm used in the present study. the oxygen flux is predominantly controlled by bulk diffusion across the membrane. The measured activation energy is 60 kJ mol−1. By fitting the permeation data for various thicknesses to the transport equation obtained upon assuming linear kinetics for the surface exchange reactions and bulk ionic transport. we could derive the oxygen ionic conductivity and the characteristic membrane thickness. The latter quantity determines the transition from predominant control by diffusion to that by surface exchange. The ionic conductivity is about 0.5 S cm−1 at 1000°C.

ZG(ω)=Z0(k+jω)−1/2. has been observed in the frequency response of mixed conducting solid electrolyte systems.

Metal alkoxides are much stronger Lewis bases compared to silicon alkoxides and the acidity of water is strong enough to achieve their rapid hydrolysis via proton-assisted SN1 pathway even in the absence of additional catalysts.

Methane. the main component of natural gas. can be converted to liquid fuels. hydrogen. and other value-added chemicals through a syngas intermediate. a mixture of CO and H2. Currently. syngas is produced by reacting methane with steam at high temperatures and pressures. This process is very energy-and capitalintensive. as the reaction is highly endothermic. An alternative process to produce syngas is the partial oxidation of methane (POM) with pure oxygen in the presence of a catalyst.[1. 2] The exothermic nature of POM makes the process attractive in terms of energy consumption. The other advantage of POM over the steam-reforming process is that the H2/CO ratio of∼ 2 of the as-produced syngas is highly suitable for subsequent conversion to environmentally friendly liquid fuels through a Fischer …,True,_fNl9nsAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,182,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.200351085,6180375623846600466,/scholar?cites=6180375623846600466,,,0,0,0

Based on the large thermal expansion coefficient of La2Ce3.25O9.5. the low thermal conductivities and low sintering abilities of La2Zr2O7 and La2(Zr0.7Ce0.3)2O7. double-ceramic-layer thermal barrier coatings were prepared.

This leads to certain limitations in the achievable microstructural features. Suspension plasma spraying (SPS) is a new promising processing method which employs suspensions of sub-micrometer particles as feedstock. Therefore much finer grain and pore sizes as well as dense and also thin ceramic coatings can be achieved. Highly porous coatings with fine pore sizes are needed as electrodes in solid-oxide fuel cells. Cathodes made of LaSrMn perovskites have been produced by the SPS process.

In all cases this results from crack propagation of pre-existing cracks near the bond coat (BC)–top coat interface. Stresses developing on a microscopic scale near the BC–TBC interface of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings govern crack growth in an initial phase of the failure process. Using a finite element (FE) method the local dependence of stresses in the vicinity of this rough interface was investigated. Measurements of real roughness profiles provided geometrical parameters needed for the calculations. A significant difference in the stress distributions was found for peak and valley locations of the BC roughness profile.

The presence of nanoparticle suspension in the molten chloride resulted in improved production of NH3. recording NH3 synthesis rate of 1.78×10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 and 3.00×10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 with CoFe2O4 and Fe2O3. which are 102% and 240% higher than that without the use of a nanocatalyst. respectively.

Shear evaluation is analyzed in accordance with the Codes under different conditions: a combination of fibers with stirrups. the possible influence of flange width on shear strength and the interaction of fibers with other important parameters such as flange width and longitudinal reinforcement. The results obtained show that fibers act as additional reinforcement to stirrups and also that the Codes are within the safety limits as regards shear ultimate limit state (ULS).,True,EAG5udcAAAAJ:b0M2c_1WBrUC,65,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061813003085,14038424346117753852,/scholar?cites=14038424346117753852,,https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/45577/ECuenca-PSerna-flanges-beams.pdf;sequence=5,0,0,0

Transfer length test results of seven-wire strand on twelve different concrete mixtures were analyzed. A testing technique based on the analysis of bond behavior by means of measuring the force supported by the tendon has been used. The specimens had been instrumented with slip measurement devices at each end of the specimen. A sequence of slip values at each end of the specimen after release versus the embedment length has been analyzed. The expressions relating the transfer length to the tendon end slip are presented. A value of Guyon's factor for tendon stress distribution shape has been obtained. Two criteria to determine the transfer length from the slip sequences at both ends of the specimens have been analyzed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],True,EAG5udcAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,63,https://search.proquest.com/openview/ad782771f9e1edab34195b0f3a3789d1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=36963,4189386944776711601,/scholar?cites=4189386944776711601,,,0,0,0

The results show that limestone fillers speed up hydration reactions and provide a finer porous structure. As a result. when specimens are hardened under water. SCC made with limestone fillers tends to shrink. since the water only penetrates the outer layers of the specimen. while the interior is subject to self-desiccation. If the concrete contains substantial air content (3.2%) the water finds it easier to penetrate and the concrete swells. When hardening takes place in the open air. autogenous shrinkage in SCC is lower than in normally-vibrated concretes (NVC) and the higher the fines content. the lower the shrinkage. This is more than likely due to the use of limestone filler as addition. finer porous structure …,True,EAG5udcAAAAJ:zA6iFVUQeVQC,62,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884612000026,8970106187324030362,/scholar?cites=8970106187324030362,,,0,0,0

Although oxidative C− H bond activation of CH4 is thermodynamically and kinetically accessible at low temperatures. few catalysts are capable of preventing overoxidation of methane to carbon dioxide. This lack in selectivity arises from the high C− H bond energy (415 kJ mol− 1) of the methane molecule in comparison to the lower C− H bond energy of the partially oxidized products. which results in further oxidation through consecutive reactions. Currently. the catalytic production of methanol from methane. accomplished through the two-step process of high temperature (∼ 1170 K) steam reforming to syngas and its subsequent conversion over Cu-based methanol …,True,EAG5udcAAAAJ:DJbcl8HfkQkC,59,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.8b01180,537816724258730380,/scholar?cites=537816724258730380,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscatal.8b01180,0,0,0

Herein. we demonstrate that this reaction is catalyzed by a [Cu–O–Cu]2+ motif that forms via a hypothesized proton-aided diffusion of hydrated Cu ions within the cages of SSZ-13 zeolites. While various Cu configurations may be present and active for methane oxidation. a dimeric Cu motif is the primary active site for selective partial methane oxidation. Mechanistically. CH4 activation proceeds via rate-determining C–H scission to form a surface-bound C1 intermediate that can either be desorbed as methanol in the presence of H2O/H+ or completely oxidized to CO2 by gas-phase O2.

1166878,Quantum dot solar cells,2002,Arthur J Nozik,14,Physica E: Low-dimensional Systems and Nanostructures,1-2,115-120,North-Holland,Quantum dot (QD) solar cells have the potential to increase the maximum attainable thermodynamic conversion efficiency of solar photon conversion up to about 66% by utilizing hot photogenerated carriers to produce higher photovoltages or higher photocurrents. The former effect is based on miniband transport and collection of hot carriers in QD array photoelectrodes before they relax to the band edges through phonon emission. The latter effect is based on utilizing hot carriers in QD solar cells to generate and collect additional electron–hole pairs through enhanced impact ionization processes. Three QD solar cell configurations are described: (1) photoelectrodes comprising QD arrays.

An InP precursor was formed from the reactants at room temperature; heating the precursor in a solution of trioctylphosphine oxide at 270 C for several days producedInP QDs with a mean diameter of 26.1±7.5 A (determined by counting lattice fringes in a TEM micrograph). From the known QD size distribution and its absorption spectrum. we used a theoretical model to calculate thedependence of InP QD bandgap on QD size. From these results we could then calculate thesize distribution of any InP colloid from its absorptionspectrum. It was found that preparing the InP precursor with an excess of In3+ and then heating it in a mixture of trioctylphosphine oxide and trioctylphosphine at 270 C for 3 days produced a very narrow QD size distribution with a mean diameter of 25±1.9 A.,True,Gv46Ak8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,503,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100070a004,4044034600312690793,/scholar?cites=4044034600312690793,,,0,0,0

InAs quantum dots of different sizes were synthesized and incorporated in solar cell devices. Efficient charge transfer from InAs quantum dots to TiO2 particles was achieved without deliberate modification of the quantum dot capping layer. A power conversion efficiency of about 1.7% under 5 mW/cm2 was achieved; this is relatively high for a nanocrystalline metal oxide solar cell sensitized with presynthesized quantum dots. but this efficiency could only be achieved at low light intensity. At one sun. the efficiency decreased to 0.3%.

Interfacial electron transfer processes are at the heart of catalysis. electrochemistry. and photoimaging. and have great potential for future applications in solar energy conversion and the photodegradation of environmentally hazardous chemicals. Surface Electron Transfer Processes is the first book to integrate approaches for electrochemistry. ultrasensitive laser spectroscopic studies of surfaces. and ultrahigh vacuum studies of model interfaces. The result is a detailed description of reaction mechanism. including a comprehensive treatment of interfacial electronic transitions. A wide range of surface types and structures are covered. Metals. semiconductors. nanostructures. and discrete states are treated in a unifying manner. Surface Electron Transfer Processes is organized like a tutorial. taking the reader through the basic theory required to understand the reaction dynamics. and proceeding with a comprehensive presentation of all aspects of the electronic and nuclear factors controlling surface reactions. Analysis of the assumptions and shortcomings of theoretical models leads naturally to discussion of experimental results. Subsequent chapters begin with introductory reviews of experimental studies and then bring the reader up-to-date on the most current methods for studying surface reactions and reaction mechanisms.

Solar energy is the largest source of non-carbonaceous energy and can be used to produce both electricity and fuel. However. the ratio of the areal cost to the conversion efficiency for devices converting solar photons to electricity or fuel must be reduced by at least 1 order of magnitude from the present values; this requires large increases in the cell efficiency and large reductions in the cost per unit area. We have shown how semiconductor quantum dots may greatly increase photon conversion efficiencies by producing multiple excitons from a single photon. This is possible because quantization of energy levels in quantum dots slows the cooling of hot excitons. promotes multiple exciton generation. and lowers the photon energy threshold for this process.

1166915,CO2 in the iron and steel industry: an analysis of Japanese emission reduction potentials,2002,Dolf Gielen and Yuichi Moriguchi,30,Energy policy,10,849-863,Elsevier,A new linear programming model has been developed for the analysis of CO2 emission reduction potentials in the Japanese iron and steel industry. This model is named Steel Environmental strategy Assessment Program. The model can be used to analyse the impact of CO2 taxes on technology selection. iron and steel trade and product demand for the next three decades. The Japanese iron and steel industry accounts for approximately 15% of the Japanese greenhouse gas emissions. The model results suggest that these emissions will decline from a level of 185 Mt in 2000 to about 150 Mt in 2020–2030 because of declining production and increasing recycling. A further emission reduction to 90 Mt is technologically feasible and can be achieved through a global tax of 5000¥/t CO2 (120¥ is equivalent to 1 US$).

A clear sign of the impact that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are having on the earth’s climate is that the average global temperature of the most recent years is the warmest on record. As a result. glaciers are rapidly disappearing and sea levels are rising more than 0.2 cm per year. In September 2015. the average global temperature over land and ocean surfaces was 0.9 C above the twentieth-century average1. This temperature rise is in line with the projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) forecasting models. which relate these effects to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At the start of 2015. the CO2 concentration was 400 parts per million (ppm).

This option is analysed in more detail in this paper. The results suggest that a CO2 capture system. based on a shift reaction and physical absorption. in combination with underground or oceanic carbon storage. could be attractive. Costs are estimated to amount to 10.3–18.8 US$/t CO2. depending on the iron production process. This cost level is similar to or even lower than the cost level for CO2 removal for new coal fired power plants. Global CO2 emissions could be reduced by 4%. Japanese CO2 emissions could be reduced by 6.5% (80 Mt/yr) in case this option were applied to its full extent by the iron and steel industry.

The concept is that GHG emission reduction in developing countries will also reduce local air pollution. On the basis of this concept. it is argued that it is possible to achieve simultaneously a reduction of local air pollution and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In reality. however. there is a sequence to the policy agenda. First the apparent local air pollution problems are tackled then the more distant greenhouse gas problem is considered. This sequence has consequences for the optimal policy selection. Moreover. most studies that focus on fringe benefits of GHG policies neglect the existence of cost-effective dedicated abatement technology for local air pollutants.

Energy benchmark curves provide data measured at individual plants and they offer a basis to estimate the sectoral energy efficiency improvement potentials (IP) compared to a best practice technology (BPT) currently in operation worldwide. In this paper. we estimate the BPT energy use of 17 industry sectors based on such curves or energy indicators prepared at country-level. We compare BPT data with current energy use to estimate the IP. According to our analysis. BPT offers improvement potentials of 27 ± 8% worldwide. This is equivalent to 32.5 ± 9.6 EJ (exajoules) of final energy savings worldwide. of which three-quarters can be achieved in developing countries.

This share is projected to increase as the economy expands rapidly. The level of industrial energy efficiency in India varies widely. Certain sectors. such as cement. are relatively efficient. while others. such as pulp and paper. are relatively inefficient. Future energy efficiency efforts should focus on direct reduced iron. pulp and paper and small-scale cement kilns because the potentials for improvement are important in both percentage and absolute terms. Under business as usual. industrial energy use is projected to rise faster than total final energy use. A strong focus on energy efficiency can reduce this growth. but CO2 emissions will still rise substantially.

The method should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate diverse applications whose contexts are location specific and path dependent without imposing the straightjacket constraints of a “one size fits all” cookbook approach. Nonetheless. the method should produce unitless indicators that can be employed to judge the relative vulnerabilities of diverse systems to multiple stresses and to their potential interactions.

These issues manifest in very different ways in each of the three “spheres”. but often the impacts are closely related. Identifying these interrelationships a priori is of great importance to help target synergies and avoid potential tensions. Systems thinking is required to address such a wide swath of possible topics.

Such a strategy will have to reflect the long time horizon of. and the prevailing uncertainties about. climate change. An intuitively appealing approach therefore seems to be to enhance the flexibility and resilience of systems to react to and cope with climate shocks and extremes. as well as to improve information. In addition. in the case of quasi-irreversible investments with a long lifetime (e.g. infrastructure investments. development of coastal zones). precautionary adjustments may be called for to increase the robustness of structures. or to increase the rate of depreciation to allow for earlier replacement.

Article 2 of the UNFCCC states that:“... the ultimate objective of this Convention… is to achieve… stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved with a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change. to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.”(UNEP/WMO. 1992).The ultimate goal for stabilizing GHG concentrations is to avoid “dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” The question of what is dangerous is one that the authors of this chapter cannot answer. Danger is a function of the degree to which effects are negative and the degree to which those effects are unacceptable. The latter is a value judgment.

Although there is substantial scope for economizing on the consumption of water without affecting its service level. the main response to water scarcity has been to increase the supply. To a large extent. this is done by transporting water from places where it is abundant to places where it is scarce. At a smaller scale and without a lot of public and political attention. people have started to tap into the sheer limitless resource of desalinated water. This study looks at the development of desalination and its costs over time. The unit costs of desalinated water for five main processes are evaluated. followed by regressions to analyze the main influencing factors to the costs. The unit costs for all processes have fallen considerably over the years.

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

This static approach ignores the dynamic effects through which climate change may affect economic growth and hence future welfare. In this paper we take a closer look at these dynamic effects. in particular saving and capital accumulation. With a constant savings rate. a lower output due to climate change will lead to a proportionate reduction in investment which in turn will depress future production (capital accumulation effect) and. in almost all cases. future consumption per capita. If the savings rate is endogenous. forward looking agents would change their savings behavior to accommodate the impact of future climate change.

Negative impacts will be substantially greater in poorer. hotter. and lower-lying countries.

H2S) and nitrogen compounds (NOx and NH3) was investigated using subscale fuel cells. The severity of the effect of these impurities varies depending on the contaminants. Among air contaminants. sulfur compounds cause the most severe performance loss due to decrease of available Pt sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We found that sulfur compounds adsorbed on Pt surface tend to be oxidized to sulfate at 0.9 V and higher potentials. The cell performance can be recovered partially by excursions to high potentials due to increase of available Pt sites. Furthermore. flushing the cathode with high humidity gases results in almost complete recovery of the cell performance.

1166979,Electrochemical Degradation: Electrocatalyst and Support Durability,2011,Shyam S Kocha,,Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Degradation,,89,Academic Press,Stack technology for direct hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) for automotives has advanced to levels where commercialization is projected to commence around 2015. Currently (2010). there are an estimated 200 operational fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and 20 fuel cell buses; these FCVs typically employ compressed hydrogen stored in tanks at 350–700 bar. can be refueled in about 3–4 min. and provide a driving range comparable to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. About 10 million tons of hydrogen are produced in the US every year and currently~ 60 hydrogen fueling stations supply fuel to the vehicles. However. several fundamental and practical engineering challenges need to be addressed in order to clear the pathway towards automotive PEMFC commercialization. The challenges lie in both the areas of durability/cost of the fuel cell components (catalyst. membrane. diffusion media. bipolar plates. etc.). and the balance of plant (thermal. fuel. air. and water management). In this chapter. we focus on the electrochemical degradation of the most critical fuel cell components–namely the catalyst and the support it is dispersed on. Cost analyses (by TIAX. LLC and DTI) assuming 500.000 units/year indicate that improvements in technology have resulted in a lowering of the projected transportation fuel cell system cost from $275/kW in 2002 to $51/kW in 2010–well on the way towards the target of $30/kW in 2015 [1–3]. The cost of the stack alone is about half the cost of the entire fuel cell system including the balance of plant.

Kerogen contained in oil shale can be retorted to produce liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. The ATP is an above-ground oil shale retort that combusts the coke or “char” deposited on the shale during retorting to fuel the retorting process.

Our dataset contains 308 oil fields covering 3× 109 m2 (1180 square miles). and a total of 9.775 wells. The cumulative crude oil produced to date is 25.1 billion bbl. Given that nearly all California oil fields are in the southern half of the state. we assume that the land above the California fields is 25% chaparral and 75% grassland. These land types have carbon stocks in soil and above ground biomass of 8 and 4 g C/m2 (80 and 40 Mg C/ha). respectively. for chaparral and 8 and 1 g C/m2 (80 and 10 Mg C/ha). respectively. for grassland (Searchinger et al. 2008). To estimate the fraction of land in California oil fields that is disturbed. we used an image analysis program to convert the images of three oil fields into binary files (black and white). Black being the vegetation. which is typically much darker than the dirt roads and areas around wells. The percentages without vegetation (white) range from 25-35% for the 3 fields analyzed. with a few images having as low as 10% cleared.We use Jordaan and Keith (2008. submitted to ERL) study to estimate the average land use for open pit mining and in situ production.

1166997,Oil depletion and the energy efficiency of oil production: The case of California,2011,Adam R Brandt,3,Sustainability,10,1833-1854,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,This study explores the impact of oil depletion on the energetic efficiency of oil extraction and refining in California. These changes are measured using energy return ratios (such as the energy return on investment. or EROI). I construct a time-varying first-order process model of energy inputs and outputs of oil extraction. The model includes factors such as oil quality. reservoir depth. enhanced recovery techniques. and water cut. This model is populated with historical data for 306 California oil fields over a 50 year period. The model focuses on the effects of resource quality decline. while technical efficiencies are modeled simply. Results indicate that the energy intensity of oil extraction in California increased significantly from 1955 to 2005. This resulted in a decline in the life-cycle EROI from 6.5 to 3.5 (measured as megajoules (MJ) delivered to final consumers per MJ primary energy invested in energy extraction. transport. and refining). Most of this decline in energy returns is due to increasing need for steam-based thermal enhanced oil recovery. with secondary effects due to conventional resource depletion (eg. increased water cut).

Unfortunately. quantitative work to date in this area has suffered from poor data availability and uncertain methods. We apply a new methodology and new dataset to compute ERRs (energy return ratios) for the oil sands industry. We collected monthly oil sands energy consumption and output data from 1970 to 2010. Current oil sands operations have mine mouth NERs (net energy returns) of about 6 GJ output per GJ of energy consumed and point of use energy returns of about 3 GJ/GJ. Long-term trends show oil sands operations becoming significantly more efficient: point of use NER increased from about 1 GJ/GJ in 1970 to 3 GJ/GJ in 2010.

A lack of a general mathematical framework prevents inter-comparison of NER/EROI estimates between authors: methods used are not standardized. nor is there a framework for succinctly reporting results in a consistent fashion. In this paper we derive normalized mathematical forms of four ERRs for energy extraction and conversion pathways. A bottom-up (process model) formulation is developed for an n-stage energy harvesting and conversion pathway with various system boundaries. Formations with the broadest system boundaries use insights from life cycle analysis to suggest a hybrid process model/economic input output based framework. These models include indirect energy consumption due to external energy inputs and embodied energy in materials. Illustrative example results are given for simple energy extraction and conversion pathways.

Golden. CO (United States),The combination of high oil costs. concerns about oil security and availability. and air quality issues related to vehicle emissions are driving interest in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). PHEVs are similar to conventional hybrid electric vehicles. but feature a larger battery and plug-in charger that allows electricity from the grid to replace a portion of the petroleum-fueled drive energy. PHEVs may derive a substantial fraction of their miles from grid-derived electricity. but without the range restrictions of pure battery electric vehicles. As of early 2007. production of PHEVs is essentially limited to demonstration vehicles and prototypes. However. the technology has received considerable attention from the media. national security interests. environmental organizations. and the electric power industry. The use of PHEVs would represent a significant potential shift in the use of electricity and the operation of electric power systems.

1167018,The value of compressed air energy storage with wind in transmission-constrained electric power systems,2009,Paul Denholm and Ramteen Sioshansi,37,Energy Policy,8,3149-3158,Elsevier,In this work. we examine the potential advantages of co-locating wind and energy storage to increase transmission utilization and decrease transmission costs. Co-location of wind and storage decreases transmission requirements. but also decreases the economic value of energy storage compared to locating energy storage at the load. This represents a tradeoff which we examine to estimate the transmission costs required to justify moving storage from load-sited to wind-sited in three different locations in the United States. We examined compressed air energy storage (CAES) in three “wind by wire” scenarios with a variety of transmission and CAES sizes relative to a given amount of wind. In the sites and years evaluated. the optimal amount of transmission ranges from 60% to 100% of the wind farm rating. with the optimal amount of CAES equal to 0–35% of the wind farm rating. depending heavily on wind …,True,U42-EW8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,338,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421509002328,9976567731658090812,/scholar?cites=9976567731658090812,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1354704,0,0,0

Our analysis shows that TES can increase the value of CSP by allowing more thermal energy from a CSP plant's solar field to be used. allowing a CSP plant to accommodate a larger solar field. and by allowing CSP generation to be shifted to hours with higher energy prices.

Storage devices were simulated in a utility system in the western United States. and the operational costs of generation was compared to the same system without the added storage. This operational value of storage was estimated for devices of various sizes. providing different services. and with several sensitivities to fuel price and other factors. Overall. the results followed previous analyses that demonstrate relatively low value for load-leveling but greater value for provision of reserve services. The value was estimated by taking the difference in operational costs between cases with and without energy storage and represents the operational cost savings from deploying storage by a traditional vertically integrated utility. The analysis also estimated the potential revenues derived from a merchant storage plant in a restructured market. based on marginal system prices. Due to suppression of on-/off-peak price differentials and incomplete capture of system benefits (such as the cost of power plant starts). the revenue obtained by storage in a market setting appears to be substantially less than the net benefit provided to the system.

The solar resource itself is virtually unlimited compared to any conceivable demand for energy (Morton 2006); however. the ultimate contribution from PV could be limited by several factors in the current grid. One is the limited coincidence between the solar resource and normal demand patterns (Denholm and Margolis 2007a). A second is the limited flexibility of conventional generators to reduce output and accommodate this variable generation resource. At high penetration of solar generation. increased grid flexibility will be needed to fully utilize the variable and uncertain output from PV generation and shift energy production to periods of high demand or reduced solar output (Denholm and Margolis 2007b).,True,U42-EW8AAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,137,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6442239949170072351&hl=en&oi=scholarr,6442239949170072351,/scholar?cites=6442239949170072351,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1030440,0,0,0

Inc.,A new method is derived for computing the wave propagation constant γ of a uniform transmission line. The new method is based on the properties of a similar and unitary matrix. and allows us to minimize the errors due to connection repeatability. These matrices are obtained from the wave cascade matrices (computed from scattering parameter measurements) of two different length lines of identical but unknown characteristic impedance. The usefulness of the new method is demonstrated by assessing the dispersion of the dielectric constant εeff and the attenuation constant α of an ultra‐low‐loss transmission line in the frequency range of 0.040–65 GHz. ©1999 John Wiley & Sons.

1167125,Mechanical stress impairs mitosis progression in multi-cellular tumor spheroids,2013,Annaïck Desmaison and Céline Frongia and Katia Grenier and Bernard Ducommun and Valérie Lobjois,8,PloS one,12,e80447,Public Library of Science,Growing solid tumors are subjected to mechanical stress that influences their growth rate and development. However. little is known about its effects on tumor cell biology. To explore this issue. we investigated the impact of mechanical confinement on cell proliferation in MultiCellular Tumor Spheroids (MCTS). a 3D culture model that recapitulates the microenvironment. proliferative gradient. and cell-cell interactions of a tumor. Dedicated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microdevices were designed to spatially restrict MCTS growth. In this confined environment. spheroids are likely to experience mechanical stress as indicated by their modified cell morphology and density and by their relaxation upon removal from the microdevice. We show that the proliferation gradient within mechanically confined spheroids is different in comparison to MCTS grown in suspension. Furthermore. we demonstrate that a population of cells within the body of mechanically confined MCTS is arrested at mitosis. Cell morphology analysis reveals that this mitotic arrest is not caused by impaired cell rounding. but rather that confinement negatively affects bipolar spindle assembly. All together these results suggest that mechanical stress induced by progressive confinement of growing spheroids could impair mitotic progression. This study paves the way to future research to better understand the tumor cell response to mechanical cues similar to those encountered during in vivo tumor development.,True,WFbJ2JgAAAAJ:B3FOqHPlNUQC,50,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080447,12591252117264372056,/scholar?cites=12591252117264372056,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080447,0,0,0

While a multitude of 60 GHz front-ends have been published in recent years. they are not consequently optimized for low power consumption. Thus. these front-ends dissipate too much power for battery-powered applications like handheld devices. mobile phones and wireless sensor networks. This article describes the design of a direct conversion receiver front-end that addresses the issue of power consumption. while at the same time permitting low cost (due to area minimization by the use of spiral inductors). It is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS technology. The realized front-end achieves a record power consumption of only 43mW including lownoise amplifier (LNA). mixer. a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). a local oscillator (LO) buffer and a baseband buffer (without this latter buffer the power consumption is even lower.only 29mW).

Dielectric charging caused by charge injection under voltage stress was observed. The amphoteric nature of traps and its effect on the switch operation were confirmed under both positive and negative control voltages. Furthermore. it has been confirmed that the charging is a complicated process. which can be better described through the stretched exponential relaxation.

In these devices stiction can be caused by two main mechanisms: dielectric charging and meniscus formation resulting from the adsorbed water film between the switch bridge and the dielectric layer. The effect of each mechanism and their interaction were investigated by measuring the adhesive and friction forces under different electrical stress conditions and relative humidity levels. An atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to perform force–distance and friction measurements on the nanoscale.

Both RF MEMS switches and metal-semiconductor-metal capacitors with PECVD silicon nitride as the dielectric layer were fabricated and their charging mechanisms were examined. Measurements indicate that charging arises from the formation of a defect band where charge transport occurs through a Poole-Frenkel-like effect.

Their output mainly consists of a mixture of atomic nitrogen and metastable excited molecules. The relative concentration of these species as a function of RF power and nitrogen gas flow rate has been investigated by plasma optical emission spectroscopy. It is shown that the concentration of excited molecular nitrogen species is monotonically increasing with both parameters while the concentration of nitrogen atoms is almost independent of the nitrogen gas flow rate and increases monotonically with the coupled RF power. As a result of this functional dependence. the plasma source can be tuned to produce mainly excited nitrogen molecules or a mixture of excited molecules and atomic nitrogen.

Relatively large barrier height differences have been observed between Ga- and N-face GaN polarities which we ascribed to the possible influence of the surface fixed charge caused by the opposite spontaneous polarization in GaN with Ga- and N-polarities. Large differences between barrier height calculated from I–V and C–V curves may also be caused by the fixed surface polarization charge. Barrier heights decrease with decreasing temperature for both polarities and ideality factors increase. Low ideality factors and no excess leakage currents indicate thermionic transport mechanism for Ga-face diodes at temperatures over 200 K.

Sustained growth of InN is possible for In/N flux ratio less than one and substrate temperature below 520 ∘C. However. under these conditions. nucleation of InN islands that grow with large height to width aspect ratios is observed. This is attributed to low N adatom mobility on the surface as well as to the significantly higher active nitrogen flux incident on the top surface of the islands as compared to the one incident on their lateral faces. Therefore the substrate temperature dependant nucleation density of the InN islands becomes the key factor determining their coalescence.

The switch has been integrated in a 0.13mum CMOS SOI process with high resistivity substrate and a thick oxide (50Aring) option.

Indeed. most radio communication standards employ nonconstant envelope modulation such as in the 802.11 series. Owing to power amplifiers' nonlinearities. distortions on the modulations degrade the overall transmitter performance. As a consequence. linearization methods. such as envelope elimination and restoration. have to be employed. The architecture relies on the transformation of a nonconstant envelope modulation to a constant or switched one. This signal coding enables the efficient amplification of the signal without undergoing power amplifier distortions.
