46939,Principles of bioactive lipid signalling: lessons from sphingolipids,2008,Yusuf A Hannun and Lina M Obeid,9,,2,139-150,Nature Publishing Group,It has become increasingly difficult to find an area of cell biology in which lipids do not have important. if not key. roles as signalling and regulatory molecules. The rapidly expanding field of bioactive lipids is exemplified by many sphingolipids. such as ceramide. sphingosine. sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). ceramide-1-phosphate and lyso-sphingomyelin. which have roles in the regulation of cell growth. death. senescence. adhesion. migration. inflammation. angiogenesis and intracellular trafficking.

46940,Programmed cell death induced by ceramide,1993,Lina M Obeid and Corinne M Linardic and Linda A Karolak and Yusuf A Hannun,259,Science,5102,1769-1771,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation have been implicated in a signal transduction pathway that mediates the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and other agents on cell growth and differentiation. In many leukemic cells. TNF-alpha causes DNA fragmentation. which leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). C2-ceramide (0.6 to 5 microM). a synthetic cell-permeable ceramide analog. induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. which was inhibited by zinc ion. Other amphiphilic lipids failed to induce apoptosis. The closely related C2-dihydroceramide was also ineffective. which suggests a critical role for the sphingolipid double bond. The effects of C2-ceramide on DNA fragmentation were prevented by the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. which suggests the existence of two opposing intracellular pathways in the regulation of apoptosis.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1940,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/259/5102/1769.abstract,2973647685557548927,/scholar?cites=2973647685557548927,,,0
46941,Functions of ceramide in coordinating cellular responses to stress,1996,Yusuf A Hannun,274,,5294,1855-1859,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Sphingolipid metabolites participate in key events of signal transduction and cell regulation. In the sphingomyelin cycle. a number of extracellular agents and insults (such as tumor necrosis factor. Fas ligands. and chemotherapeutic agents) cause the activation of sphingomyelinases. which act on membrane sphingomyelin and release ceramide. Multiple experimental approaches suggest an important role for ceramide in regulating such diverse responses as cell cycle arrest. apoptosis. and cell senescence. In vitro. ceramide activates a serine-threonine protein phosphatase. and in cells it regulates protein phosphorylation as well as multiple downstream targets [such as interleukin converting enzyme (ICE)-like proteases. stress-activated protein kinases. and the retinoblastoma gene product] that mediate its distinct cellular effects.

Recent significant progress in understanding biologically active sphingolipid synthesis. specifically within ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated pathways. has identified crucial roles for these molecules both in cancer development and progression.

When the mechanism of inhibition of activity and phorbol dibutyrate binding was investigated in vitro using Triton X-100 mixed micellar methods. sphingosine inhibition was subject to surface dilution; 50% inhibition occurred when sphingosine was equimolar with sn-1.2-dioleoylglycerol (diC18:1) or 40% of the phosphatidylserine (PS) present.

46951,An overview of sphingolipid metabolism: from synthesis to breakdown,2010,Christopher R Gault and Lina M Obeid and Yusuf A Hannun,,,,1-23,Springer. New York. NY, Sphingolipids constitute a class of lipids defined by their eighteen carbon amino-alcohol backbones which are synthesized in the ER from nonsphingolipid precursors. Modification of this basic structure is what gives rise to the vast family of sphingolipids that play significant roles in membrane biology and provide many bioactive metabolites that regulate cell function. Despite the diversity of structure and function of sphingolipids. their creation and destruction are governed by common synthetic and catabolic pathways. In this regard. sphingolipid metabolism can be imagined as an array of interconnected networks that diverge from a single common entry point and converge into a single common breakdown pathway.In their simplest forms. sphingosine. phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine serve as the backbones upon which further complexity is achieved.

Nerve growth factor can activate the sphingomyelin cycle. generating the putative-lipid second messenger ceramide. In T9 glioma cells. addition of a cell-permeable ceramide analog mimicked the effects of nerve growth factor on cell growth inhibition and process formation. This signaling pathway appears to be mediated by p75NTR in T9 cells and NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing p75NTR. Expression of an epidermal growth factor receptor-p75NTR chimera in T9 cells imparted to epidermal growth factor the ability to activate the sphingomyelin cycle.

46961,Enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism: from modular to integrative signaling,2001,Yusuf A Hannun and Chiara Luberto and Kelley M Argraves,40,,16,4893-4903,American Chemical Society,Many enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism are regulated in response to extra- and intracellular stimuli and in turn serve as regulators of levels of bioactive lipids (such as sphingosine. ceramide. sphingosine 1-phosphate. and diacylglycerol). and as such. they serve a prototypical modular function in cell regulation. However. lipid metabolism is also closely interconnected in that a product of one enzyme serves as a substrate for another. Moreover. many cell stimuli regulate more than one of these enzymes. thus adding to the complexity of regulation of lipid metabolism. In this paper. we review the status of enzymes of sphingolipid metabolism in cell regulation and propose a role for these enzymes in integration of cell responses. a role that builds on the modular organization while also taking advantage of the complexity and interconnectedness of lipid metabolism. thus providing for a combinatorial mechanism of …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,561,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bi002836k,4757191625000085986,/scholar?cites=4757191625000085986,,,0

Whether such correlation implies a high unavoidable intrinsic cancer risk has become a key public health debate with the dissemination of the ‘bad luck’hypothesis. Here we provide evidence that intrinsic risk factors contribute only modestly (less than~ 10–30% of lifetime risk) to cancer development. First. we demonstrate that the correlation between stem-cell division and cancer risk does not distinguish between the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We then show that intrinsic risk is better estimated by the lower bound risk controlling for total stem-cell divisions. Finally. we show that the rates of endogenous mutation accumulation by intrinsic processes are not sufficient to account for the observed cancer risks.

A Wiley Company,A novel pathway termed the sphingomyelin cycle has been identified whereby membrane sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed in response to multiple extracellular stimuli (such as tumor necrosis factor α) which cause activation of regulated sphingomyelinases. The product. ceramide. has emerged as a second messenger that mediates many of the cellular effects of these extracellular stimuli. An intriguing relation exists between activation of the sphingomyelin cycle and the action of multiple stress stimuli that induce growth arrest and programmed cell death. Exogenously administered ceramide mimics these growth‐suppressing effects. including the induction of apoptosis.

In this signal transduction pathway. extracellular inducers such as tumor necrosis factor alpha cause hydrolysis of membrane SM. resulting in the generation of the lipid second messenger ceramide. Only 10-20% of cellular SM appears to be involved in the SM cycle. raising the possibility of the existence of a unique “signaling” pool of SM. The existence and subcellular location of such a pool were investigated. Using bacterial sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus (bSMase). we first characterized two pools of SM. identified as an outer leaflet bSMase-sensitive pool and a distinct bSMase-resistant pool. These pools were further characterized by their differential solubility in Triton X-100 and by their kinetics of labeling.

In breast cancer cells. cisplatin produces early and marked changes in cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton. These changes manifest as loss of lamellipodia/filopodia and appearance of membrane ruffles. Furthermore. cisplatin induces dephosphorylation of the actin-binding protein ezrin. and its relocation from membrane protrusions to the cytosol. Because cisplatin activates acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase). we investigate here the role of the ASMase/ceramide (Cer) pathway in mediating these morphological changes. We find that cisplatin induces a transient elevation in ASMase activity and its redistribution to the plasma membrane.

We identified two mouse strains. flincher (fln) and toppler (to). with spontaneous recessive mutations that cause cerebellar ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration. Positional cloning demonstrated that these mutations reside in the Lass1 gene. Lass1 encodes (dihydro)ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1). which is highly expressed in neurons. Both fln and to mutations caused complete loss of CerS1 catalytic activity. which resulted in a reduction in sphingolipid biosynthesis in the brain and dramatic changes in steady-state levels of sphingolipids and sphingoid bases. In addition to Purkinje cell death. deficiency of CerS1 function also induced accumulation of lipofuscin with ubiquitylated proteins in many brain regions. Our results demonstrate clearly that ceramide biosynthesis deficiency can cause neurodegeneration and suggest a novel mechanism of lipofuscin formation. a common phenomenon that occurs during normal aging and in some neurodegenerative diseases.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:7wO8s98CvbsC,129,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002063,17828111994782461793,/scholar?cites=17828111994782461793,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002063,0

In mammals. degradation of ceramide by ceramidase yields sphingosine. which is phosphorylated by the action of sphingosine kinase to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate. Therefore. ceramidases are key enzymes in the regulation of the cellular levels of ceramide. sphingosine. and sphingosine 1-phosphate. To explore the physiological functions of a neutral ceramidase with diverse cellular locations. we disrupted the Asah2 gene in mice.

Inactivation of serine palmitoyltransferase. a key enzyme in generating endogenous phytosphingosine. prevents proteolysis during heat stress. Addition of phytosphingosine bypasses the requirement for serine palmitoyltransferase and restores proteolysis.

The impact of sphingolipids on cancer research facilitated the entry of sphingolipid analogues and enzyme modulators into clinical trials. Owing to its ability to regulate two bioactive sphingolipids. ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate. acid ceramidase (AC) emerges as an attractive target for drug development within the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Indeed. there is extensive evidence supporting a pivotal role for AC in lipid metabolism and cancer biology.

To date. the subcellular localization of PKC during sustained activation has not been extensively studied. We report here that long term activation of PKC (1 h) leads to the selective translocation of classical PKC isoenzymes. α and βII. to a juxtanuclear compartment.

We investigate whether lipids that are membrane components and involved in cell signaling could modify the Ca2+-dependent activation of tTG. We found that sphingosylphosphocholine (lyso-SM) was the only lipid to activate transglutaminase at low Ca2+ concentrations. In the presence of lyso-SM (125 μm). transglutaminase was detectable at 10 μm Ca2+. whereas in the absence of lyso-SM. similar activity was obtained at 160 μm Ca2+. Furthermore. in the presence of lipid vesicles lyso-SM retained the ability to enhance the Ca2+-dependent activation of tTG. Lyso-SM did not significantly change the K m for the glutamyl and primary amine substrates. However. the K actfor Ca2+ was reduced from …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,76,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818701014,15262520421398670974,/scholar?cites=15262520421398670974,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818701014,0

Although activation of N-SMase by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF was described almost two decades ago. the underlying signaling pathway is unresolved. Here. we identify the Polycomb group protein EED (embryonic ectodermal development) as an interaction partner of nSMase2. In yeast. the N terminus of EED binds to the catalytic domain of nSMase2 as well as to RACK1. a protein that modulates the activation of nSMase2 by TNF in concert with the TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1)-associated protein FAN.

Recent studies have identified a novel translocation of PKC to a juxtanuclear compartment. the pericentrion. which is distinct from the Golgi complex but epicentered on the centrosome. Sustained activation of PKC (longer than 30 min) also results in sequestration of plasma membrane lipids and proteins to the same compartment. demonstrating a global effect on endocytic trafficking. This review summarizes these studies. particularly focusing on the characterization of the pericentrion as a distinct PKC-dependent subset of recycling endosomes.

Because of the potential role of protein kinase C (PKC) in apoptosis. we examined the effects and mechanisms of TNF-α on PKC regulation. specifically on PKCα. In L929 murine fibroblasts. TNF-α (0.5– 5 nm) caused potent inhibition of PKCα activity and induced translocation of PKCα from the cytosol to the membrane. Treatment of cells with TNF-α also induced dephosphorylation of PKCα as detected by a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and inhibition of PKC phosphorylation as probed by anti-phospho-PKC antibodies. Since PKC is activated directly by diacylglycerol and inactivated indirectly by ceramide. we next examined the roles of these lipid mediators in the regulation of PKCα.

However. not all cancer cells are susceptible to TRAIL and mechanisms of resistance and new strategies to enhance sensitivity are an area of intense investigation. Glucose withdrawal or paclitaxel increase intracellular ceramide. down-regulate cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (cFLIP). and sensitize cells to TRAIL. Therefore. we investigated whether TRAIL resistance is due to ceramide levels and/or defects in ceramide generation following ligand binding.

MA,Ceramide (Cer) occupies a central role in sphingolipid metabolism (Hannun and Luberto. 2000; Merrill and Wang. 1992). Ceramide metabolism commences in the de novo pathway with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl CoA. resulting in the formation of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (Merrill and Wang. 1992). which in turn serves as a precursor to dihydrosphingosine (Figure 1). Dihydrosphingosine is then acylated at the 2-amino position to cause the formation of dihydroceramide. It is accepted that the sphingolipid 4-5 double bond is inserted at this point. causing the formation of Cer. In turn. Cer is the precursor of mammalian complex sphingolipids. which are distinguished by substitutions at the 1-hydroxyl position of ceramide. For example. sphingomyelin contains a choline phosphate head group. whereas cerebroside contains a glucosyl or galactosyl subunit.

These classes of inhibitors are based on indole and quinoline structures and are represented by MK-886 and L-674.573. respectively. A novel class of hybrid structure based on the indole and quinoline classes of inhibitors. termed quindoles. has recently been developed. These compounds. exemplified by L-689.037. are potent inhibitors of leukotriene biosyn-thesis. both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study. we have developed and characterized a potent radioiodinated photo-affinity analogue of L-689.037. termed [1251} L-691. 678. This com-pound was used in immunoprecipitation studies with FLAP anti-sera to show that the quindole series of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors interact directly with FLAP. In addition. we show that MK-886.

However. the upstream signaling events in this process. including those leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. are still poorly characterized.

Consistently. these mutant cells displayed lower levels of ROS production and reduced mitochondrial alterations. such as mitochondrial fragmentation and degradation. and decreased translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol in response to acetic acid.

A general hypothesis can be presented whereby individual enzymes of ceramide metabolism serve as input points in the regulation of ceramide levels (Scheme 1). For example. activation of SMases or ceramide synthase would elevate ceramide levels and activate ceramide‐induced responses. On the other hand. activation of enzymes of ceramide degradation or incorporation such as ceramidases or SM synthase decreases and attenuates ceramide levels. Also. as an important corollary. some of these enzymes may play an additional fundamental role in interconverting lipid signals. For example.

Two stable cell lines were isolated (SPIβ2 and SPIβ8) in which the levels of PI-TPβ were increased 16- and 11-fold respectively. The doubling time of the SPIβ cells was about 1.7 times that of the wild-type (wt) cells. Because PI-TPβ expresses transfer activity towards sphingomyelin (SM) in vitro. the SM metabolism of the overexpressors was investigated. By measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]choline chloride in SM and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). it was shown that the rate of de novo SM and PtdCho synthesis was similar in transfected and wt cells.

To this end. the major functional groups and stereochemistry of ceramide (Cer) were evaluated for their influence on the hydrolysis of substrate by this CDase. The results showed that. of the four possible stereoisomers of Cer. only the natural d-e-C18-Cer isomer was used as substrate (Km of 1.1 mol% and Vmax of 5 μmol/min/mg). Removal of the 4–5 trans double bond to generate dihydroceramide decreased the affinity of the enzyme toward its substrate by around 90%. whereas changing the configuration of the double bond from the natural trans configuration into cis or introduction of a hydroxyl group (phytoceramide) resulted in loss of hydrolysis.

Interestingly. kidney function declines during aging even in the absence of underlying renal disease. Declining renal function has been associated with age-related cellular damage and dysfunction with reports of increased levels of apoptosis. necrosis. and inflammation in the aged kidney. Bioactive sphingolipids have been shown to regulate these same cellular processes. and have also been suggested to play a role in aging and cellular senescence.   Methodology/Principal Findings We hypothesized that alterations in kidney sphingolipids play a role in the declining kidney function that occurs during aging. To begin to address this. the sphingolipid profile was measured in young (3 mo). middle aged (9 mo) and old (17 mo) C57BL/6 male mice. Interestingly. while modest changes in ceramides and sphingoid bases were evident in kidneys from older mice. the most dramatic elevations were seen in long-chain hexosylceramides (HexCer) and lactosylceramides (LacCer). with C14- and C16-lactosylceramides elevated as much as 8 and 12-fold. respectively. Increases in long-chain LacCers during aging are not exclusive to the kidney. as they also occur in the liver and brain. Importantly. caloric restriction. previously shown to prevent the declining kidney function seen in aging. inhibits accumulation of long-chain HexCer/LacCers and prevents the age-associated elevation of enzymes involved in their synthesis.

Their ability to spontaneously form a lipid bilayer which provides a permeability barrier between extracellular and intracellular compartments is essential for cell survival. Over the last several decades. another role became widely appreciated. Phospholipids. particularly glycerolipids. emerged as a rich reservoir of a broad variety of bioactive molecules generated in response to extracellular stimuli (Dennis et al. 1991; Liscovitch and Cantley. 1994). These metabolites can function either as intracellular second messengers [such as diacylglycerol (DAG). inositol triphosphate. and arachidonic acidf or as intercellular mediators (such as platelet-activating factor and the eicosanoids)(Nishizuka. 1992; Rhee et al.. 1989; Majerus et al.. 1986; Berridge and Irvine. 1989; Nahorski and Potter. 1989; Hanahan. 1986; Exton. 1990). A number of signaling pathways have now been well established with increasingly complex cross-interactions. The common theme is that of an extracellular signal-activated phospholipase that has specificity to a particular phospholipid substrate present in the cell membrane. The subsequent hydrolysis of the phospholipid results in the generation of bioactive molecules that are either released extracellularly where they exert their functions by binding to specific receptors on target cells or diffuse intracellularly where they act on specific targets (eg. the different protein kinase C isozymes or calcium channels)(Nishizuka. 1992; Rhee et al.. 1989).

LLC,Human cells respond to DNA damage by elevating sphingosine. a bioactive sphingolipid that induces programmed cell death (PCD) in response to various forms of stress. but its regulation and role in the DNA damage response remain obscure. Herein we demonstrate that DNA damage increases sphingosine levels in tumor cells by upregulating alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) and that the upregulation of the ACER2/sphingosine pathway induces PCD in response to DNA damage by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin increased both ACER2 expression and sphingosine levels in HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner. ACER2 overexpression increased sphingosine in HeLa cells whereas knocking down ACER2 inhibited the doxorubicin-induced increase in sphingosine in HCT116 cells. suggesting that DNA damage elevates …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:u_mOZUIutIEC,31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951300/,12480709327547869373,/scholar?cites=12480709327547869373,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951300/,0

This study was carried out to investigate whether the neutral Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) plays a role in the cellular signaling evoked by TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs. two stress-inducing agents. which are mitogenic at low concentrations and proapoptotic at higher concentrations.  Methodology and Principal Findings For this purpose. we used nSMase2-deficient cells from homozygous fro/fro (fragilitas ossium) mice and nSMase2-deficient cells reconstituted with a V5-tagged nSMase2. We report that the genetic defect of nSMase2 (in fibroblasts from fro/fro mice) does not alter the TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs-mediated apoptotic response. Likewise. the hepatic toxicity of TNFalpha is similar in wild type and fro mice. thus is independent of nSMase2 activation. In contrast. the mitogenic response elicited by low concentrations of TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs (but not fetal calf serum) requires nSMase2 activation.  Conclusion and Significance nSMase2 activation is not involved in apoptosis mediated by TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs in murine fibroblasts. and in the hepatotoxicity of TNFalpha in mice. but is required for the mitogenic response to stress-inducing agents.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:7BrZ7Jt4UNcC,29,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009826,986711295356575519,/scholar?cites=986711295356575519,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009826,0

However. the dynamics and interactions among the different sphingolipid species are difficult to assess. because de novo biosynthesis. metabolic inter-conversions. and the retrieval of sphingolipids from membranes form a complex. highly regulated pathway system. Here we analyze the heat stress response of this system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate how the cell dynamically adjusts its enzyme profile so that it is appropriate for operation under stress conditions before changes in gene expression become effective. The analysis uses metabolic time series data. a complex mathematical model. and a custom-tailored optimization strategy. The results demonstrate that all enzyme activities rapidly increase in an immediate response to the elevated temperature. After just a few minutes. different functional clusters of enzymes follow distinct activity patterns. Interestingly. starting after about six minutes. both de novo biosynthesis and all exit routes from central sphingolipid metabolism become blocked. and the remaining metabolic activity consists entirely of an internal redistribution among different sphingoid base and ceramide pools. After about 30 minutes. heat stress is still in effect and the enzyme activity profile is still significantly changed.

Previously. ceramide has been shown to activate protein phosphatase (PP) 1 and 2A. While continuing this line of work. a late fraction from a Mono-Q column was consistently observed to be activated by ceramide. yet PP1 and PP2A were undetectable in this fraction. Proteomic analysis of this fraction revealed the identity of the phosphatase to be PP2Cγ/PPM1G. This was consistent with our findings that PP2Cγ 1-eluted in a high salt fraction due to its strongly acidic domain. and 2-was insensitive to okadaic acid.

47371,Mathematical modeling and validation of the ergosterol pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,2011,Fernando Alvarez-Vasquez and Howard Riezman and Yusuf A Hannun and Eberhard O Voit,6,PloS one,12,e28344,Public Library of Science,The de novo biosynthetic machinery for both sphingolipid and ergosterol production in yeast is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. The interconnections between the two pathways are still poorly understood. but they may be connected in specialized membrane domains. and specific knockouts strongly suggest that both routes have different layers of mutual control and are co-affected by drugs. With the goal of shedding light on the functional integration of the yeast sphingolipid-ergosterol (SL-E) pathway. we constructed a dynamic model of the ergosterol pathway using the guidelines of Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) (Savageau.. J. theor. Biol.. 25. 365–9. 1969). The resulting model was merged with a previous mathematical model of sphingolipid metabolism in yeast (Alvarez-Vasquez et al.. J. theor. Biol.. 226. 265–91. 2004; Alvarez-Vasquez et al.. Nature 433. 425–30. 2005). The S-system format within BST was used for analyses of consistency. stability. and sensitivity of the SL-E model. while the GMA format was used for dynamic simulations and predictions. Model validation was accomplished by comparing predictions from the model with published results on sterol and sterol-ester dynamics in yeast. The validated model was used to predict the metabolomic dynamics of the SL-E pathway after drug treatment. Specifically. we simulated the action of drugs affecting sphingolipids in the endoplasmic reticulum and studied changes in ergosterol associated with microdomains of the plasma membrane (PM).,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:D_tqNUsBuKoC,26,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028344,10001367632518952888,/scholar?cites=10001367632518952888,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0028344,0

The role of chemotherapeutic agents and their metabolites in mediat-ing this platelet defect was investigated. 1. 3-Bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea(BCNU). but not cyclophosphamide or cis-plati-num. was found to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro in response to activation by either ADP. thrombin. or collagen. Inhibition by BCNU was dose dependent and required preincubation of platelets with BCNU. After a 60-mm preincubation. 30 zM BCNU produced 50% inhibition of platelets in platelet-rich plasma. The cyclophosphamide metabolites acrolein and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide also inhibited platelet aggregation in a dose-de-pendent manner. with a requirement for preincubation. Platelet inhibition occurred at clinically relevant concentrations of BCNU and metabolites of cyclophosphamide. The effects of acrolein were totally prevented by coincubation with the sulfhydryl-pro-tecting agents N-acetylcysteine and 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid. whereas the effects of BCNU were incompletely prevented. The mechanism of platelet inhibition was investigated next by examining protein phosphorylation in response to platelet agonists.

Our previous studies suggested that the DAG/PKC pathway plays an important role in the induction of secretion and secondary aggregation rather than the earlier events of shape change and primary aggregation. We therefore examined the hypothesis that the delayed effects of PKC on platelets may result from delayed accumulation of DAG. The kinetics of DAG formation in human platelets were determined.

While IQGAP2 suppresses tumorigenesis in liver. its role in pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract remains unexplored. Here we report that IQGAP2 is required for the inflammatory response in colon. Mice lacking Iqgap2 gene (Iqgap2-/- mice) were resistant to chemically-induced colitis. Unlike wild-type controls. Iqgap2-/- mice treated with 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in water for 13 days displayed no injury to colonic epithelium. Mechanistically. resistance to colitis was associated with suppression of colonic NF-κB signaling and IL-6 synthesis. along with diminished neutrophil and macrophage production and recruitment in Iqgap2-/- mice. Finally. alterations in IQGAP2 expression were found in colons of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our findings indicate that IQGAP2 promotes inflammatory response at two distinct levels; locally. in colonic epithelium through TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. and systemically. via control of maturation and recruitment of myeloid immune cells. This work identifies a novel mechanism of colonic inflammation mediated by signal transducing scaffolding protein IQGAP2.

47424,Ceramide and the regulation of apoptosis and the stress response,1996,David K Perry and Lina M Obeid and Yusuf A Hannun,6,,5,158-162,Elsevier,The process of apoptosis or programmed cell death has been the subject of intense study due to the realization of its importance in a wide variety of biological and pathological conditions. including development. ischemia. cancer. and neurodegenerative disorders. Although a vast number of inducers of this process and several critical components have been identified. the signal transduction pathways regulating apoptosis are poorly understood. Recently. a pathway involving sphingolipid turnover and the production of the lipid mediator. ceramide. has emerged as a candidate regulator of apoptosis. This review provides a summary of the evidence implicating ceramide as a mediator of apoptosis and the stress response.

SK1 overexpression has been observed in numerous cancers. Recent studies have demonstrated that SK1 proteolysis occurs downstream of the tumor suppressor p53 in response to several DNA‐damaging agents. Moreover. loss of SK1 in p53‐knockout mice resulted in complete protection from thymic lymphoma. providing evidence that regulation of SK1 constitutes a major tumor suppressor function of p53. Given this profound phenotype. this study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which wild‐type p53 regulates proteolysis of SK1 in response to the DNA‐damaging agent doxorubicin in breast cancer cells. We find that p53‐mediated activation of caspase‐2 was required for SK1 proteolysis and that caspase‐2 activity significantly alters …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:o-PowTg_VKEC,14,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2211-5463.12344,11568497322680142250,/scholar?cites=11568497322680142250,,https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2211-5463.12344,0

GBA1 cleaves glucosylceramide to form ceramide. an established bioactive lipid. and defects in GBA1 lead to aberrant accumulation in glucosylceramide and insufficient formation of ceramide. We investigated if the pro-inflammatory kinase p38 is activated in Gaucher’s disease. since ceramide has been proposed to suppress p38 activation. Three Gaucher’s disease mouse models were employed. and p38 was found to be activated in lung and liver tissues of all Gaucher’s disease mice. Most interestingly. neuronopathic Gaucher’s disease type mice. but not non-neuronopathic ones. displayed significant activation of p38 and up-regulation of p38-inducible proinflammatory cytokines in brain tissues. In addition. all type of Gaucher’s disease mice also showed increases in serum IL-6. As cellular signalling is believed to represent an in vivo inflammatory phenotype in Gaucher’s disease. activation of p38 and possibly its-associated formation of proinflammatory cytokines were assessed in fibroblasts established from neuronopathic Gaucher’s disease mice. In mouse Gaucher’s disease cells. p38 activation and IL-6 formation by TNF-α treatment were enhanced as compared to those of wild type. Furthermore. human fibroblasts from Gaucher’s disease patients also displayed increases in p38 activation and IL-6 formation as comparison to healthy counterpart. These results raise the potential that proinflammatory responses such as p38 activation and IL-6 formation are augmented in Gaucher’s disease.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:v_xunPV0uK0C,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136633,11626348203175883784,/scholar?cites=11626348203175883784,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136633,0

Ceramide and. more recently. other sphingolipid species (e.g.. dihydroceramide and dihydrosphingosine) have been implicated in 4-HPR-mediated tumor cell death. Because sphingolipid metabolism has been reported to be altered in drug-resistant tumor cells. we studied the implication of sphingolipids in acquired resistance to 4-HPR based on an acute lymphoblastic leukemia model. CCRF-CEM cell lines resistant to 4-HPR were obtained by gradual selection. Endogenous sphingolipid profiles and in situ enzymatic activities were determined by LC/MS. and resistance to 4-HPR or to alternative treatments was measured using the XTT viability assay and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide labeling. No major crossresistance was observed against other antitumoral compounds (i.e. paclitaxel. cisplatin. doxorubicin hydrochloride) or agents (i.e. ultra violet C. hydrogen peroxide) also described as sphingolipid modulators. CCRF-CEM cell lines resistant to 4-HPR exhibited a distinctive endogenous sphingolipid profile that correlated with inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase. Cells maintained acquired resistance to 4-HPR after the removal of 4-HPR though the sphingolipid profile returned to control levels. On the other hand. combined treatment with sphingosine kinase inhibitors (unnatural (dihydro)sphingosines ((dh)Sph)) and glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor (PPMP) in the presence or absence of 4-HPR increased cellular (dh)Sph …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:CdxZDUztZiMC,14,https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-11-477,132574198055659010,/scholar?cites=132574198055659010,,https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-11-477,0

47431,Quantitative analysis of diacylglycerol second messengers in human platelets: correlation with aggregation and secretion.,1992,MARK H Werner and ALICJA E Bielawska and YUSUF A Hannun,41,Molecular pharmacology,2,382-386,American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics,The action of many agonists results in rapid production of sn-1. 2-diacylglycerol(DAG). Using platelets as a model system. we previously identified a delayed phase of DAG accumulation that is temporally associated with secondary aggregation and secre-tion. In the present study. we examined the quantitative relationship between this delayed DAG accumulation and platelet aggregation and secretion. To quantitate the low levels of DAG in platelets. we used the sensitive DAG kinase assay and simulta-neously compared DAG levels with aggregation and ATP secre-tion. In platelets stimulated by-y-thrombin or collagen. there was a dose response between concentration of agonist and DAG accumulation. Significantly. a dose response was observed between DAG accumulation and extent of aggregation and secretion in platelets stimulated by either agonist. A concentration of either-y-thrombin or collagen that caused secondary aggregation and secretion was associated with DAG accumulation above 0.2 pmol of DAG/nmol of phospholipid. Subthreshold concentrations of y-thrombin or collagen resulted in DAG levels less than 0.2 pmol/nmol of phospholipid. Thus. these data suggest that a threshold level of DAG must be achieved for platelet activation to occur. Moreover. secretion was blocked when DAG production was blocked with aspirin or when protein kinase C was inhibited with sphingosine. We conclude that endogenously formed DAG plays a critical role in regulating secondary aggregation and secretion and. therefore. represents an important target for future antiplatelet agents.DAG has emerged as a critical second messenger in the …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC,14,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1052.1549&rep=rep1&type=pdf,13126232139905674450,/scholar?cites=13126232139905674450,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1052.1549&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Our previous studies indicate that the SphK1/S1P pathway mediates colon carcinogenesis at least by regulating cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. However. the mechanisms by which this pathway regulates colon carcinogenesis are still unclear. First. we show that SphK1 deficient mice significantly attenuated azoxymethane (AOM)-induced colon carcinogenesis as measured by colon tumor incidence. multiplicity. and volume.

However. the functions of sustained activation of PKC are not well studied. We have previously shown that sustained activation of classical PKC isoforms over 15-60 min induced the formation of the pericentrion. a subset of recycling endosomes that are sequestered perinuclearly in a PKC- and phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent manner. In this study. we investigated the role of this process in the phosphorylation of EGFR on threonine 654 (Thr-654) and in the regulation of intracellular trafficking and fate of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Sustained stimulation of the angiotensin II receptor induced translocation of the EGFR to the pericentrion. which in turn prevents full access of EGF to the EGFR. These effects required PKC and PLD activities. and direct stimulation of PKC with phorbol esters was sufficient to reproduce these effects. Furthermore. activation of PKC induced delayed phosphorylation of EGFR on Thr-654 that coincided with the formation of the pericentrion and which was dependent on PLD and endocytosis of EGFR. Thus. Thr-654 phosphorylation required the formation of the pericentrion. On the other hand. using a T654A mutant of EGFR. we find that the phosphorylation on Thr-654 was not required for translocation of EGFR to the pericentrion but was required for protection of EGFR from degradation in response to EGF. Taken together. these results demonstrate a novel role for the pericentrion in the regulation of EGFR …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:DQNrXyjhriIC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080721,4388537736153000232,/scholar?cites=4388537736153000232,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0080721,0

Research into bioactive sphingolipids over the past two decades has played an important role in increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis and therapeutics of CRC. In the complex metabolic network of sphingolipids. ceramidases (CDases) have a key function. These enzymes hydrolyze ceramides into sphingosine (SPH) which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SK) 1 and 2 to generate sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P). Importantly. we have recently shown that inhibition of neutral CDase (nCDase) induces an increase of ceramide in colon cancer cells which decreases cellular growth. increases apoptosis and modulates the WNT/β-catenin pathway. We have also shown that the deletion of nCDase protected mice from the onset and progression of colorectal cancer in the …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:UarirCmVI0EC,11,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-018-0236-x,16746592149769603057,/scholar?cites=16746592149769603057,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041258/?text=The+current+results+add+a+new+dimension+to+the+regulation+of+AKT+by+ceramide+by+demonstrating+that+endogenous+ceramide+may+serve+to+attenuate+activation+of+AKT+and+that+nCDase+has+a+key+function+in+controlling+that+function+of+ceramide.,0

Previous studies have implicated ASM in the induction of the chemokine CCL5 in response to TNF-α however. the lipid mediator of this effect was not established. In the present study. we identified a novel pathway connecting ASM and ceramide kinase (CERK). The results show that TNF-α induces the formation of ceramide 1-phosphate (C-1-P) in a CERK-dependent manner. Silencing of CERK blocks CCL5 production in response to TNF-α. Interestingly. cells lacking ASM have decreased C-1-P production following TNF-α treatment. suggesting that ASM may be acting upstream of CERK. Functionally. ASM and CERK induce a highly concordant program of cytokine production and both are required for migration of breast cancer cells. Taken together. these data suggest ASM can produce ceramide which is …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:yKzB5RS27GgC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022227520330790,10888324798278375558,/scholar?cites=10888324798278375558,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022227520330790,0

The process is similar to bone formation and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Given that ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are involved in cardiovascular pathophysiology and biomineralization. their role in VSMC matrix mineralization was investigated. During phosphate-induced VSMC mineralization. endogenous S1P levels increased accompanied by increased sphingosine kinase (SK) activity and increased mRNA expression of SK1 and SK2. Consistent with this. mineralization was increased by exogenous S1P. but decreased by C2-ceramide. Mechanistically. exogenous S1P stimulated ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) phosphorylation in VSMCs and ERM phosphorylation was increased concomitantly with endogenous S1P during …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:h1pkognVyKwC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002222752033933X,7404812046755786528,/scholar?cites=7404812046755786528,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002222752033933X,0

We first constructed a novel gene network via a pairwise comparison of all yeast genes’ Ontology Fingerprints—a set of Gene Ontology terms overrepresented in the PubMed abstracts linked to a gene along with those terms’ corresponding enrichment P-values. The network was further refined using a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify novel genes that could potentially influence the pathway activities.

Significant effort has been put into developing a thorough understanding of the molecular and genetic events that contribute to tumor progression due to mounting evidence that breast cancers are driven by predictable and identifiable genetic mutations. Sphingolipids modulate many of the growth. apoptosis. inflammatory. and angiogenic pathways that breast carcinomas rely on. Recent work in the field of sphingolipidomics has identified many key roles for the sphingolipids in breast tumor progression and identified signaling roles in each of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer.

Therapies that inactivate HSCs have clinical potential as antifibrotic agents. We previously identified acid ceramidase (aCDase) as an antifibrotic target. We showed that tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) reduce hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting aCDase and increasing the bioactive sphingolipid ceramide. We now demonstrate that targeting aCDase inhibits YAP/TAZ activity by potentiating its phosphorylation-mediated proteasomal degradation via the ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein β-TrCP.

We have manipulated glyco-enzymes retrotransport. a core process in intra-Golgi trafficking. through controlled alterations of the levels of GOLPH3. a coatomer adaptor that drives the retrograde movement of glyco-enzymes and shows oncogenic properties in humans. and examined glycan assembly. We find that: a) GOLPH3 is part of the cisternal maturation mechanism. yet it specifically binds and sorts for recycling a subset of enzymes involved in glycan assembly on sphingolipids. while other enzymes recycle independently of GOLPH3. This indicates that cisternal maturation is an ensemble of enzyme-recycling modules; b) GOLPH3 increases the levels of its client enzymes via a regulated-degradation mechanism based on delaying their escape from the Golgi into the lysosomes; and. c) by changing the levels of key enzymes. GOLPH3 alters the glycan patterns assembled on sphingolipids. to produce more proliferation-inducing glycosphingolipid metabolites.

47525,9 Ceramide and Lipid Mediators in Apoptosis,2011,Thomas D Mullen and Russell W Jenkins and Lina M Obeid and Yusuf A Hannun,,Apoptosis: Physiology and Pathology,,88,Cambridge University Press,As a cellular signaling program. apoptosis is a highly controlled and complex process that depends on the orchestrated interactions of multiple soluble factors: ions (eg. Ca2+). proteins (eg. caspases. Bcl-2 family members). and nonprotein substrates (eg. DNA). Equally important. although less well characterized. is signaling through cellular membranes and the lipids and proteins contained therein. Lipids are the primary constituents of biological membranes and thus play a structural role in defining cellular and organellar boundaries. However. lipids are not merely passive molecules serving inert. structural functions in these membranes. Many lipids are now appreciated as signaling molecules. capable of influencing diverse cellular processes and exerting powerful influence over many physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. such as programmed cell death. Sphingolipids represent one class of bioactive lipid mediators that are now recognized as key determinants of cell fate. This chapter discusses the regulated generation of bioactive sphingolipids (eg. ceramide) and how sphingolipid signaling impacts the regulation of programmed cell death.Lipid signaling is the control of cellular function through the modulation of membrane lipid composition. Although a full discussion of cellular lipid composition would require its own textbook. a few general concepts should be presented.

How the Golgi determines glycan assembly is poorly understood. By relying on the Golgi cisternal maturation model and using the glyco-enzyme adaptor and oncoprotein GOLPH3 as a molecular tool. we define the first example of how the Golgi controls glycosylation and associated cell functions. GOLPH3. acting as a component of the cisternal maturation mechanism. selectively binds and recycles a subset of glyco-enzymes of the glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway. hinders their escape to the lysosomes and hence increases their levels through a novel lysosomal degradation-regulated mechanism. This enhances the production of specific growth-inducing glycosphingolipids and reprograms the glycosphingolipid pathway to potentiate mitogenic signaling and cell proliferation. These findings unravel unforeseen organizing principles of Golgi-dependent glycosylation and delineate a paradigm for glycan assembly by the Golgi transport mechanisms.

This requires that the glycan biosynthesis be controlled to achieve specific cellular glycan profiles. Glycans are assembled in the Golgi apparatus on secretory cargoes that traverse it. The mechanisms by which the Golgi apparatus ensures cell- and cargo-specific glycosylation remain obscure. We investigated how the Golgi apparatus regulates glycosylation by studying the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids. glycosylated lipids with critical roles in signalling and differentiation. We identified the Golgi matrix protein GRASP55 as a controller of sphingolipid glycosylation by regulating the compartmentalized localization of key sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes in the Golgi. GRASP55 controls the localization of the enzymes by binding to them and regulating their entry into peri-Golgi vesicles. Impairing GRASP55-enzyme interaction decompartmentalizes these enzymes. changes the substrate flux across competing glycosylation pathways that results in alteration of the cellular glycosphingolipid profile. This GRASP55 regulated pathway of enzyme compartmentalization allows cells to make cell density-dependent adaptations in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis to suit cell growth needs. Thus. the Golgi apparatus controls the cellular glycan (glycosphingolipid) profile by governing competition between biosynthetic reactions through regulated changes in enzyme compartmentalization.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:HAmI6pRF5skC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.074682v2.abstract,11988370974486671329,/scholar?cites=11988370974486671329,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/10/21/2020.05.03.074682.full.pdf,0

We utilized UHPLC-MS/MS to determine the profile of full set of ceramides. sphingosine. and sphingosine 1-phosphate in this xenograft mouse model. The tissues isolated and investigated were from brain. lung. heart. liver. spleen. kidney. bladder. tumors and blood. With the exception of equal volume of blood plasma (100ul). all tissues were studied with the same amount of protein (800ug). Results demonstrated that brain contained the highest level of ceramide and kidney had the highest level of sphingosine. whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate and dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate were heavily presented in the blood. Brain also comprised the highest level of phospholipids. As for the species. several ceramides. usually present in very low amounts in cultured tumor cells. showed relatively high levels in certain tissues.

However. much remains unknown in terms of the signaling mechanisms and downstream pathways affected by sphingolipids in cancers. such as which sphingolipid pathway is involved. which sphingolipid species contributes to a specific cancer’s biologic response. and which regulatory pathways are modulated by these bioactive sphingolipids. Due to the connectivity of sphingolipid metabolic network. it is difficult to address the above questions using conventional experimental approaches because manipulation of any one enzyme often results in a metabolic “ripple effect” across the network that are not easy to predict.

Deletion of ISC1 causes sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl‐methane sulfonate (MMS). and G2/M arrest. Here we show that replication stress by hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl‐methane sulfonate (MMS) in isc1Δ cells induces morphological and cellular aberrations such as elongated buds. chains of cells. accumulation of high levels of chitin in cell walls. and loss of depolymerization of actin. Mechanistically. loss of Isc1 led to overexpression of Swe1p whereas deletion of Swe1p abolished these morphological aberrations in isc1Δ cells. thus implicating Swe1p as a key mediator of the effects of Isc1 loss.

The nature of the stressful condition determines the type of response generated by the organism. For example. nutritional starvation results in metabolic adaptation with catabolism of new substrates and slowing down of the metabolic rate. genotoxic damage results in the induction of several genes which orchestrate the repair of damaged DNA. while severely damaged or infected cells are eliminated by a process of programmed cell death. known as apoptosis.

The proenzyme form. protein kinase C. could be activated by proteolysis or by a membrane factor in the presence of Ca2+ (Takai et al.. 1979a.b). The membrane factor was initially identified as phospholipid. with phosphatidylserine (PS) being most effective (Takai et al.. 1979a.b). At this point. protein kinase C was referred to as the phospholipid- and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. Crude lipid extracts from brain proved to be more effective than PS and Ca2+ in activating the enzyme; this led to the discovery of a neutral lipid. sn-1.2-diacylglycerol (DAG). which increased the enzyme’s affinity for both PS and Ca2+ (Kishimoto et al.. 1980). DAG could activate protein kinase C at resting levels of Ca2+.

Sphingosine kinase 1. or SK1. is one of two sphingosine kinases that phosphorylate sphingosine into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P is generally pro-inflammatory. pro-angiogenic. immunomodulatory. and pro-survival; therefore. high SK1 expression and activity have been associated with certain inflammatory diseases and cancer. It is thus important to develop an understanding of the regulation of SK1 expression and activity.

One notable “curiosity” has been the observation that upon neuronal differentiation. stem cells switch the expression of their surface glycosphingolipids (GSLs) by substituting one class (the globo‐series) of GSLs by another (the ganglio‐series). Russo and colleagues show that there is an intricate dance between these two lipid series such that the globo products suppress neuronal differentiation via the master regulator AUTS2. which in turn suppresses the formation of the ganglio‐series.

47592,Alkaline ceramidase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ceramides via a catalytic mechanism shared by Zn2+-dependent amidases,2018,Jae Kyo Yi and Ruijuan Xu and Lina M Obeid and Yusuf A Hannun and Michael V Airola and Cungui Mao,,bioRxiv,,442202,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Human alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3) is one of three alkaline ceramidases (ACERs) that catalyze the conversion of ceramide to sphingosine. ACERs are the members of the CREST superfamily of integral-membrane lipid hydrolases. including the adiponectin receptors which play roles in energy metabolism. All CREST members conserve a set of three Histidine. one Aspartate. and one Serine residue. However. the structural and catalytic roles for these residues are unclear. Here. we use ACER3 as a prototype enzyme to gain insight into this unique class of enzymes. Recombinant ACER3 was expressed in yeast cells that lack endogenous ceramidase activity. and microsomes were used for biochemical characterization. Six point mutantions of the conserved CREST motif were developed that are predicted to form a Zn-dependent active site based on homology with the human adiponectin receptors. whose crystal structures were recently determined. Five mutations completely lost their activity. except for S77A. which showed a 600-fold decrease compared with the wild-type enzyme. The activity of S77C mutation was pH sensitive. with neutral pH partially recovering ACER3 activity. This suggested a role for S77 in stabilizing the oxyanion of the transition state and differs from the proposed role in Zinc coordination for the adiponectin receptors (Vasiliauskaité-Brooks et. al.. Nature. 2017). Together. these data suggest ACER3 is a Zn2+-dependent amidase that uses a catalytic mechanism for ceramide hydrolysis that is similar to other soluble Zn-based amidases. Consistent with this mechanism. ACER3 was specifically inhibited by trichostatin A. an …,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:4tNoA7Af41QC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/442202v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/10/12/442202.full.pdf,0

Here. we review in detail the biosynthetic and degradation pathways of sphingolipids in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. a model organism whose sphingolipid composition is rather simple but with conserved metabolic pathways and regulation mechanisms as higher eukaryotes.

The enzyme was initially discovered by Nishizuka and coworkers who defined a proteolytically activated kinase from rat brain. A number of discoveries by that group led to the recognition of the significance of protein kinase C as an important regulator of tumor promotion. cell regulation. and cell differentiation. Initial characterization of the enzyme by Nishizuka and coworkers led to the identification that the proenzyme could be activated in the presence of membranes and calcium. Further studies led to the identification that the neutral lipid. diacylglycerol (DAG). caused potent activation of the enzyme and significantly reduced its calcium requirement to the low micromolar and high nanomolar range. rendering the enzyme active at physiologic concentrations of calcium in the presence of DAG. This finding led Nishizuka and coworkers to implicate protein kinase C in the pathways mediating the effects of"" calcium-mobilizing"" agents in what had been termed as the"" phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle""(1). In this cycle. the action of a number of extracellular agents leads to the activation of phospholipase C which results in the cleavage of inositolphospholipids yielding inositol trisphosphate and DAG. Inositol trisphosphate mobilizes intracellular calcium while DAG activates protein kinase C.

In this study. the link between Sch9 and sphingolipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae was examined in vivo based on the observation that the sch9Δ mutant displays altered sensitivities to various inhibitors of sphingolipid metabolism. ie myriocin and aureobasidin A. In line with this. cells lacking Sch9 showed increased levels of long-chain bases and long-chain base-1 phosphates. decreased levels of several species of (phyto) ceramides and altered ratio’s of complex sphingolipids. Genetic analysis confirmed that Sch9 plays a critical role in ceramide homeostasis by controlling de novo ceramide synthesis as well as regulating the activity of the inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C. Isc1. which is required for ceramide production by hydrolysis of complex sphingolipids. The balance between de novo and hydrolytic ceramide synthesis is crucial for survival and dictates the stress tolerance and longevity of yeast cells.

Emerging evidence. however. is pointing to significant complexities in the metabolism and structure of ceramide with multiple pathways mediated by more than 2 dozen distinct enzymes of ceramide metabolism regulating the formation of ceramide. Indeed. ceramide itself constitutes a family of closely‐related molecules that are distinguished by specific modifications (e.g. chain length of acyl and sphingoid groups. hydroxylations. specific double bonds). These concepts are well illustrated by studies on acid and neutral sphingomyelinases. two key enzymes in ceramide formation.

Here we report that mitochondria from neutral ceramidase (NCDase)‐deficient mice have drastically reduced formation of ceramide from sphingosine and palmitoyl‐CoA. as well as from sphingosine and palmitate. compared to mitochondria from wild type (WT) mice. This suggests that NCDase is a key participant of ceramide formation in mitochondria. The presence of NCDase in mitochondria by Western blot was demonstrated. and the evidence that NCDase is the major carrier of ceramidase activity at the neutral pH was provided. The reaction occurs in two steps. First. palmitoyl‐CoA is hydrolyzed by thioesterase with the formation of CoA and palmitate. Next. NCDase condenses palmitate and sphingosine to ceramide in a reverse ceramidase reaction.

This study was carried out to investigate whether the neutral Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2) plays a role in the cellular signaling evoked by TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs. two stress-inducing agents. which are mitogenic at low concentrations and proapoptotic at higher concentrations.Methodology and Principal Findings: For this purpose. we used nSMase2-deficient cells from homozygous fro/fro (fragilitas ossium) mice and nSMase2-deficient cells reconstituted with a V5-tagged nSMase2. We report that the genetic defect of nSMase2 (in fibroblasts from fro/fro mice) does not alter the TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs-mediated apoptotic response. Likewise. the hepatic toxicity of TNFalpha is similar in wild type and fro mice. thus is independent of nSMase2 activation. In contrast. the mitogenic response elicited by low concentrations of TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs (but not fetal calf serum) requires nSMase2 activation.Conclusion and Significance: nSMase2 activation is not involved in apoptosis mediated by TNFalpha and oxidized LDLs in murine fibroblasts. and in the hepatotoxicity of TNFalpha in mice. but is required for the mitogenic response to stressinducing agents.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:vjZqxyZ7hS4C,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/48827510/Stress-Induced_Sphingolipid_Signaling_Ro20160914-29835-2b4cfg.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48827510/Stress-Induced_Sphingolipid_Signaling_Ro20160914-29835-2b4cfg.pdf,0

However. the effect of ceramide on antigen processing and HLA class II‐mediated delivery to CD4+ T cells remains unclear. We have previously shown that intracellular ceramide levels can be regulated by ceramide anlogs that directly interfere with ceramide‐metabolizing enzymes such as acid ceramidases. In this study. we examined the actions of these cell permeable ceramide analogs on professional antigen presenting cells (APC) that constitutively express HLA class II proteins and functionally present antigens to CD4+ T cells.

Sphingolipid functions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: comparison to mammals. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67: 27–48). In mammals. ceramide can be generated through hydrolysis of sphingomyelin catalyzed by sphingomyelinase (SMase). To date. as many as five SMases have been identified molecularly. separated into three main groups: acid. alkaline. and neutral SMases (nSMases)(Marchesini. N.. and Y. Hannun. 2004. Acid and neutral sphingomyelinases: roles and mechanisms of regulation. Biochem. Cell Biol. 82: 27–44). nSMase in mammals is represented by its homolog. inositol phosphosphingolipase C. codified by ISC1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) and by CSS1 (Can’t Stop Synthesizing cell wall) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp). Yeasts do not have sphingomyelin but instead have inositol phosphosphingolipids. which may function as orthologs of mammalian sphingomyelin. In this review. we will describe findings related to the function of ISC1. its localization. mechanisms. and its roles in cell response to different types of stresses. These studies serve as a foundation for the elucidation of the properties and functions of the extended family of nSMases.—Matmati. N. and YA Hannun.

47647,Sphingoid bases mediate localization of Dcp2 to mRNA processing bodies during heat stress,2007,L Ashley Cowart and Jason L Gandy and Yusuf A Hannun,,8. Yeast Lipid Conference,,,,In Saccharomyces cerevisiae. heat stress induces a flux through de novo  sphingolipid biosynthesis resulting in transient increases in phyto- and dihydrosphingosine  and their phosphorylated derivatives. Roles for these mediators include induction of cell  cycle arrest. degradation of nutrient permeases. transcriptional regulation. and regulation of  heat shock protein translation. mRNA processing bodies (“p-bodies”) have been recently  described as cytoplasmic foci of mRNA degradation. processing. and storage. and their  formation correlates inversely with translation.   Since sphingolipids regulate translational  dynamics during heat stress. p-body formation during heat was investigated. Heat stress  induced localization of the p-body marker protein Dcp2-gfp to cytoplasmic foci by 20 minutes  of heat stress. and these foci dispersed after 40 minutes of heat stress. consistent with time  frames of sphingoid-base mediated changes in translational rates. Moreover. addition of  exogenous phytosphingosine induced similar Dcp2-gfp localization in the absence of heat.  and unnatural enantiomers of phyosphingosine could not mediate this effect. Since  sphingoid bases signal through the Pkh-Ypk signaling cascade. Dcp2-gfp localization was  tested in a strain overexpressing Ypk1. Importantly. this strain showed markedly more p-  body formation in the absence of heat stress than a strain containing empty vector.  Together these data demonstrate a novel role for sphingolipids during heat stress and  provide mechanistic leads for understanding sphingolipid-mediated regulation of translational  dynamics.,True,OH_dPj0AAAAJ:v6i8RKmR8ToC,0,https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/220,,,,,0

Among the lipid-binding proteins of this machinery. we previously identified the four-phosphate adaptor protein FAPP2. the pleckstrin homology domain of which binds phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and the small GTPase ARF1. FAPP2 also possesses a glycolipid-transfer-protein homology domain. Here we show that human FAPP2 is a glucosylceramide-transfer protein that has a pivotal role in the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids. key structural and signalling components of the plasma membrane. The requirement for FAPP2 makes the whole glycosphingolipid synthetic pathway sensitive to regulation by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and ARF1.

Many tumors have up-regulated enzymes such as the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase (AC) which deacylates ceramide forming sphingosine. This is presumed to allow the cell to survive during these times of stress. In a cancer this would likely be a negative event for the patient. The chicken anemia viral protein.

47814,Solubilization of membranes by detergents,1975,Ari Helenius and KAI Simons,415,,1,29-79,Elsevier,30 membrane structure and function it is usually necessary to dissociate the membrane into its components. The techniques for extraction and analysis of the membrane lipids are well worked out. and are mainly based on the use of organic solvents. These have also been used to extract the proteins. but the resultant irreversible aggregation and denaturation of many membrane proteins limit their usefulness. Partial and selective protein solubilization can be obtained by a number of methods involving chelating agents. manipulation of ionic strength and pH.

These glycans are then subjected to extensive modification as the glycoproteins mature and move through the ER via the Golgi complex to their final destinations inside and outside the cell. In the ER and in the early secretory pathway. where the repertoire of oligosaccharide structures is still rather small. the glycans play a pivotal role in protein folding. oligomerization. quality control. sorting. and transport. They are used as universal “tags” that allow specific lectins and modifying enzymes to establish order among the diversity of maturing glycoproteins.

47838,Virus entry into animal cells,1989,Mark Marsh and Ari Helenius,36,,,107-151,Academic Press,In addition to its many other functions. the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells serves as a barrier against invading parasites and viruses. It is not permeable to ions and to low molecular weight solutes. let alone to proteins and polynucleotides. Yet it is clear that viruses are capable of transferring their genome and accessory proteins into the cytosol or into the nucleus. and thus infect the cell. While the detailed mechanisms remain unclear for most animal viruses. a general theme is apparent like other stages in the replication cycle; their entry depends on the activities of the host cell. In order to take up nutrients. to communicate with other cells. to control the intracellular ion balance. and to secrete substances. cells have a variety of mechanisms for bypassing and modifying the barrier properties imposed by their plasma membrane.

This is born out during entry. when most viruses that infect vertebrate and insect cells exploit the endocytic activities of the host cell to move into the cytoplasm. Viruses belonging to vaccinia. adeno. picorna and other virus families have been reported to take advantage of macropinocytosis. an endocytic mechanism normally involved in fluid uptake. The virus particles first activate signalling pathways that trigger actin-mediated membrane ruffling and blebbing. Usually. this is followed by the formation of large vacuoles (macropinosomes) at the plasma membrane. internalization of virus particles and penetration by the viruses or their capsids into the cytosol through the limiting membrane of the macropinosomes.

In the microsomes. these were generated either by glucose removal from the original triglucosylated core oligosaccharide by glucosidases I and II or by reglucosylation of already unglucosylated high mannose glycans.

Studies with viral membrane proteins will continue to help illuminate these processes and have contributed greatly to the concepts of conformational maturation and quality control. Furthermore. while the effects of mutations on protein structure and transport cannot always be predicted. useful generalizations can now be made to help develop experimental strategies.

Nuclear import. export. and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling play a central role in their replication cycle. Although the trafficking of individual virus proteins into and out of the nucleus has been well studied for some virus systems. the nuclear transport of larger entities such as viral genomes and capsids has only recently become a subject of molecular analysis. In this review. the general concepts emerging are discussed and a survey is provided of current information on both plant and animal viruses. Summarizing the main findings in this emerging field. it is evident that most viruses that enter or exit the nucleus take advantage of the cell's nuclear import and export machinery.

While it is well established that they interact with substrate monoglucosylated N‐linked oligosaccharides. it has been proposed that they also interact with polypeptide moieties. To test this notion. glycosylated forms of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) were translated in the presence of microsomes and their folding and association with calnexin and calreticulin were monitored. When expressed with two N‐linked glycans in the presence of micromolar concentrations of deoxynojirimycin. this small soluble protein was found to bind firmly to both calnexin and calreticulin.

They include bacterial toxins such as Shiga and Cholera toxin and viruses such as mouse polyoma virus and simian virus 40. Through multivalent binding to glycosphingolipids. they induce lipid clustering and changes in membrane properties. Internalization occurs by unusual endocytic mechanisms involving lipid rafts. induction of membrane curvature. trans-bilayer coupling. and activation of signaling pathways. Once delivered to early endosomes. they follow diverse intracellular routes to the lumen of the ER. from which they penetrate into the cytosol. The role of the lipid receptors is central in these well-studied processes.,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:dQ2og3OwTAUC,136,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/3/8/a004721.short,16387332469115294522,/scholar?cites=16387332469115294522,,https://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/3/8/a004721.full.pdf,0

To determine which organelles participate in this conformation‐dependent sorting process. we analyzed the trafficking of the temperature‐sensitive. thermo‐reversible folding mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (tsO45 G protein) in VERO cells. Using temperature blocks. the G protein could be localized to the ER (39.5 °C). to the vesiculo‐tubular clusters (VTCs. 15 °C). and to the trans‐Golgi network (TGN. 20 °C). To localize the G protein specifically to ER exit sites. we incubated cells at 10 °C. The exit sites contained Sec13p. a COPII component. and were devoid of calnexin and other ER chaperones.

The effects were connected with dramatic alterations in the organization of the microtubule system. and. as a consequence. a change in the behavior of LEs and lysosomes (LYs). Depletion of HDAC8 caused loss of centrosome-associated microtubules and loss of directed centripetal movement of LEs. dispersing LE/LYs to the cell periphery. For HDAC1. the picture was the opposite. To explain these changes. centrosome cohesion emerged as the critical factor. Depletion of HDAC8 caused centrosome splitting. which could also be induced by depleting a centriole-linker protein. rootletin. In both cases. IAV infection was inhibited. HDAC1 depletion reduced the splitting of centrosomes. and enhanced infection. The longer the distance between centrosomes. the lower the level of infection. HDAC8 depletion was also found to inhibit infection of Uukuniemi virus (a bunyavirus) suggesting common requirements among late penetrating enveloped viruses.

The uptake and interiorization of DS were examined with a tritiated product over the course of 4 d in culture. The exposure of macrophages to 20 micrograms/ml of 3H-DS led to linear uptake for 4 d. at which time fusion was inhibited. Macrophage interiorization of 3H-DS was greatly increased by forming insoluble complexes with either serum lipoproteins or purified human low density lipoproteins (LDL). Under these conditions fusion was inhibited within 4 h. The uptake of large quantities of acetylated LDL in the absence of DS was not associated with the inhibition of fusion. Lipoproteins therefore served as the DS carriers and were not themselves inhibitory.

It has recently emerged that vaccinia virus. the prototypic poxvirus. uses macropinocytosis to gain entry.

Due to high mutation rate. new strains of IAV emerge frequently. These IAVs are often drug-resistant and require vaccine reformulation. A promising approach to circumvent this problem is to target host cell determinants crucial for IAV infection. but dispensable for the cell. Several RNAi-based screens have identified about one thousand cellular factors that promote IAV infection. However. systematic analyses to determine their specific functions are lacking. To address this issue. we developed quantitative. imaging-based assays to dissect seven consecutive steps in the early phases of IAV infection in tissue culture cells. The entry steps for which we developed the assays were: virus binding to the cell membrane. endocytosis. exposure to low pH in endocytic vacuoles. acid-activated fusion of viral envelope with the vacuolar membrane. nucleocapsid uncoating in the cytosol. nuclear import of viral ribonucleoproteins. and expression of the viral nucleoprotein. We adapted the assays to automated microscopy and optimized them for high-content screening.

We found that Semliki Forest virus is unable to penetrate or infect baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells grown in medium containing reduced Na+ concentrations. Virus endocytosis and degradation are nearly normal. the virus is transported to endosomes where a characteristic low pH-induced loss of trypsin-sensitivity of the E1 spike glycoprotein occurs. Nevertheless. the viral envelope fails to fuse with the endosomal membrane and the viral RNA is not released into the cytosol …,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:ZfRJV9d4-WMC,52,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818890780,13799226711143360513,/scholar?cites=13799226711143360513,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925818890780,0

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads within human organs is crucial for developing strategies to prevent viral dissemination. For many viruses. tissue tropism is determined by the availability of virus receptors on the surface of host cells. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host receptor. yet. their tropisms differ. Here. we found that the cellular receptor neuropilin-1 (NRP1). known to bind furin-cleaved substrates. significantly potentiates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. which was inhibited by a monoclonal blocking antibody against the extracellular b1b2 domain of NRP1. NRP1 is abundantly expressed in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. with highest expression in endothelial cells and in the epithelial cells facing the nasal cavity. Neuropathological analysis of human COVID-19 autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 infected NRP1-positive cells in the olfactory epithelium and bulb. In the olfactory bulb infection was detected particularly within NRP1-positive endothelial cells of small capillaries and medium-sized vessels. Studies in mice demonstrated. after intranasal application. NRP1-mediated transport of virus-sized particles into the central nervous system. Thus.

To determine the role of receptor diffusion. concentration and the number of receptors required for stable binding in this interaction. we analyze the binding of SV40 to GM1 in supported membrane bilayers by computational modeling based on experimental data. We measure the diffusion rates of SV40 virions in solution by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and of the receptor in bilayers by single molecule tracking. Quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) is used to measure binding of SV40 virus-like particles to bilayers containing the viral receptor GM1. We develop a phenomenological stochastic dynamics model calibrated against this data. and use it to investigate the early events of virus attachment to lipid membranes. Our results indicate that SV40 requires at least 4 attached receptors to achieve stable binding.

This second step depends on an early viral factor(s) that has eluded identification for over 40 years. We used a large-scale. high-throughput RNAi screen directed against vaccinia virus (VACV) to identify the VACV AAA+ ATPase D5 as the poxvirus uncoating factor. We show that the ATPase activity of D5 is required for uncoating. Superresolution microscopy suggests that D5 acts directly at viral cores for genome release. Thus. the putative helicase D5 is a multifunctional protein required for genome uncoating and replication.

However. the quality of large-scale RNAi screening is often deteriorated by off-targets effects. In order to find statistically significant effector genes for pathogen entry. we systematically analyzed entry pathways in human host cells for eight pathogens using image-based kinome-wide siRNA screens with siRNAs from three vendors. We propose a Parallel Mixed Model (PMM) approach that simultaneously analyzes several non-identical screens performed with the same RNAi libraries. We show that PMM gains statistical power for hit detection due to parallel screening. PMM allows incorporating siRNA weights that can be assigned according to available information on RNAi quality. Moreover. PMM is able to estimate a sharedness score that can be used to focus follow-up efforts on generic or specific gene regulators. By fitting a PMM model to our data. we found several novel hit genes for most of the pathogens studied. Our results show parallel RNAi screening can improve the results of individual screens.

In SPOPL-depleted cells. endosomes are enlarged and fail to acquire intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). We identify a critical substrate ubiquitinated by CUL3-SPOPL as EPS15. an endocytic adaptor that also associates with the ESCRT-0 complex members HRS and STAM on endosomes. Indeed. EPS15 is ubiquitinated in a SPOPL-dependent manner. and accumulates with HRS in cells lacking SPOPL.

Whether the toxin induces its own pathway or travels along a physiological retrograde route is not known. To study its trafficking. we labeled cholera toxin B (CTB) or endogenous plasma membrane proteins with a small chemical compound. benzylguanine. which covalently reacts with the protein SNAP‐tag. Using ER‐targeted SNAP‐tag as reporter. we found that transport of CTB to the ER depends on dynamin‐2 and syntaxin 5. Plasma membrane proteins and a fluid‐phase marker added to the medium were also transported to the ER. This flux was not affected by exposing cells to CTB but was inhibited by depleting syntaxin 5 and increased by depleting dynamin‐2.

To develop novel antiviral strategies. it is essential to understand the molecular aspects of virus–host cell interactions in detail. During entry. the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) that carry the RNA genome must be released from the incoming particle before they can enter the nucleus for replication. The uncoating process is facilitated by histone deacetylase 6 (ref. 1). However. the precise mechanism of shell opening and vRNP debundling is unknown.

However. to date the role of PI3K signaling in influenza infection in vivo has not been thoroughly addressed. Here we show that one of the PI3K subunits. p110γ. is in fact critically required for mediating the host’s antiviral response. PI3Kγ deficient animals exhibit a delayed viral clearance and increased morbidity during respiratory infection with influenza virus. We demonstrate that p110γ is required for the generation and maintenance of potent antiviral CD8+ T cell responses through the developmental regulation of pulmonary cross-presenting CD103+ dendritic cells under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. The defect in lung dendritic cells leads to deficient CD8+ T cell priming. which is associated with higher viral titers and more severe disease course during the infection.

48082,Influenza virus hemagglutinin and membrane fusion,1991,ROBERT W Doms and JUDY White and FRANCOIS Boulay and A Helenius,,,,313,Marcel Dekker Inc. New York. USA,Enveloped animal viruses penetrate into their host cells by membrane fusion (see also Chapter 13). The fusion reaction. which occurs between the viral envelope and a cellular membrane. is mediated by specific. virally encoded proteins (1. 2). Several fusion proteins have been identified by biochemical and genetic means. and some have been isolated from virus particles or infected cells. A few have been cloned. sequenced. and analyzed in great detail.The structure and properties of the viral fusion factors are presently the focus of considerable interest because by mediating an important step in the viral replication cycle. they constitute a potential target for antiviral strategies. They also provide the most experimentally accessible models for the study of protein-mediated membrane fusion. and they are increasingly employed as fusogens in the bulk delivery of macromolecules into cells (3). cell-cell fusion. and implantation of lipids into cellular membranes (4). For an extensive discussion of these applications of membrane fusion techniques. refer to the last part of this book. Although the fusion proteins of different viruses have common features. they are distinct proteins with quite varied properties. Sequence homologies between fusion proteins of different virus families are rare. and studies on their fusion mechanisms suggest principal differences in their mode of action (5). They are. however. all integral membrane glycoproteins and often contain fatty acyl groups. The single transmembrane region is usually located close to the C-terminus with the bulk of the mass external to the viral membrane forming spikelike projections 5-20 nm in length.,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:vbGhcppDl1QC,11,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Ns2-DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA313&dq=info:LvfNk8ilxKYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=eHBVt4QPBH&sig=N_mBC5nj0ehIRVc9TMbDAvztamA,12016911986623117102,/scholar?cites=12016911986623117102,,,0

However. very little is known about either normal values or the ways in which they might change in different circumstances. Perhaps this ignorance is partly due to a demarcation dispute with physiology: the role of Na+. K+. Ca 2+. and C1-in excitable cell electrical behavior making biochemists wary of showing interest. It is more likely. however. to be due to the technical difficulties of making relatively non-invasive measurements in single cells. Recent developments in ion-sensitive microelectrode techniques are now allowing determined investigators to overcome these difficulties.To measure the pH. or other ion activity. of a solution. it is a simple matter to use an ion activity meter and the appropriate ionsensitive electrode.

Recent work has revealed a role for N-linked glycans in targeting aberrant glycoproteins to ERAD. To further characterize the molecular basis of substrate recognition and sorting during ERAD in mammalian cells. we expressed a mutant yeast carboxypeptidase Y (CPY?) in CHO cells. CPY? was retained in the ER in un-aggregated form. and degraded after a 45-min lag period. Degradation was predominantly by a proteasome-independent. non-lysosomal pathway. The inhibitor of ER mannosidase I. kifunensine. blocked the degradation by the alternate pathway but did not affect the proteasomal fraction of degradation.

48170,pCytTS-A novel temperature-regulated replicon-based DNA expression system,2001,Marco Boorsma,,,,,,With the rapid discovery of new potential drugs and drug-targets. many proteins need to be routinely produced in large quantities. A considerable part of these proteins has detrimental effects on host cell metabolism leading to poor cell growth and low production levels. By using inducible expression systems. a large biomass can be produced under non-permissive conditions resulting in high levels of recombinant protein upon induction.To be of broad benefit an inducible system should be specifically induced by the exogenous inducer. should be independent of endogenous cellular factors. and should leave unrelated cellular pathways unaffected. Furthermore. induction should be reversible and precise; the inducer should rapidly penetrate to the site of interest and be easily removed after induction.,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:F1b5ZUV5XREC,0,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/146197/eth-25143-01.pdf,,,,https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/146197/eth-25143-01.pdf,0

the N-terminus interact cotranslationally with CNX and CRT without prior interaction with 
BiP. an ER-homologue of HSP70. In contrast. glycoproteins that have their glycans later in the 
sequence. bind BiP first with CNX- and CRT-association occurring later during post-translational 
folding. We found. moreover. that ERp57 was the thiol oxidoreductase of choice for CNX- and 
CRT-bound substrate proteins and that it formed mixed disulfides with the bound 
glycoproteins … To characterize the CRT and CNX function in more detail we used NMR spectroscopy 
to analyze the structure of the conserved P-domain of CRT. The data revealed a unique.

In E. coli. chaperoninassisted protein folding proceeds through cycles of ATPase action by the large chaperonin GroEL. and involves concerted. rigid body movements of the 3 domains in each subunit. Transient binding of the small chaperonin GroES forms an enclosed chamber. inside which folding of a protein subunit takes place. Access to the chamber and to the binding sites is regulated by the nucleotide cycle. Binding. encapsulation and release states alternate between the two back-to-back 7-membered rings of GroEL. with the movements communicated by subtle alterations of the inter-ring interface.

DC]: American Society for Microbiology. 1981-,During entry. herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) releases its capsid and the tegument proteins into the cytosol of a host cell by fusing with the plasma membrane. The capsid is then transported to the nucleus. where it docks at the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). and the viral genome is rapidly released into the nucleoplasm. In this study. capsid association with NPCs and uncoating of the viral DNA were reconstituted in vitro. Isolated capsids prepared from virus were incubated with cytosol and purified nuclei. They were found to bind to the nuclear pores. Binding could be inhibited by pretreating the nuclei with wheat germ agglutinin. anti-NPC antibodies. or antibodies against importin beta. Furthermore. in the absence of cytosol. purified importin beta was both sufficient and necessary to support efficient capsid binding to nuclei.

48176,13 Case study 3: Folding of,2000,LARS ELLGAARD and ARI HELENIUS,,Mechanisms of Protein Folding,,352,Oxford University Press. USA,Almost all the available information on protein folding has been obtained by analysing the refolding of denatured proteins in vitro in the presence or absence of added molecular chaperones. As described elsewhere in this book. studies using this approach are providing an ever more detailed picture of the biophysical principles underlying assisted and non-assisted folding of polypeptide chains. How applicable is this information to folding in living cells? How do newly synthesized proteins actually fold in situ? To obtain answers to these questions. experi-ments are needed that monitor the folding and maturation of proteins inside the compartments of live cells. Technically. this is far from easy. but as recent studies suggest. crucial information can be obtained using genetic and cell biological approaches. The results indicate that the folding process in cells is even more complicated and diversified than one would anticipate from in vitro refolding studies. First. it depends on an intricate and finely tuned cocktail of molecular chaperones. folding enzymes. and folding sensors. Secondly. since it is influenced by a variety of physiological factors. such as redox potential and ions. it follows somewhat different rules in different cellular compartments. Thirdly. it is affected by processes such as molecular sorting. membrane translocation. and protein degradation. And finally. it appears in most cases to begin co-translationally and proceed vectorially from the N-towards the C-terminus. a situation that cannot be reproduced during in vitro refolding studies.

It is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of about 550 kDa (4536 amino acids) containing 16 N-glycans. We have studied the interaction of ApoB with two lectin-like chaperones of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-Calnexin (CN) and Calreticulin (CR). Using a co-immunoprecipitation approach we observed that newly synthesized ApoB associates with CN and CR. The interaction was transient; within 30-60 min after synthesis bulk of newly formed ApoB dissociated. Using McA Rh7777 cells expressing an N-terminal fragment of ApoB we found that inhibition of glucosidases in the ER prevented the association of CN and CR to newly synthesized ApoB. The results showed that like for association with other glycoprotein substrates. trimming of glucose residues was essential for ApoB binding to CN and CR.

The influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP). matrix protein (Ml) and ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) undergo regulated nuclear import and export during different stages of infection. The directionality of nuclear trafficking of vRNPs is regulated by the M1 protein. M1 from the incoming virus dissociates from the vRNPs prior to nuclear import and nuclear Ml is needed for export of the progeny vRNPs out of the nucleus.Methods and Results. Recombinant M1. expressed in cultured cells. was found to associate with incoming vRNPs and inhibit their nuclear import. Brief acidification of the cytosol. eliminated the interfering activity and allowed the vRNPs to enter the nucleus. Progeny Ml-vRNP complexes in the cytosol of infected cells were also dissociated by brief acidification. Similar observations were seen when vRNP trafficking was analyzed using heterokaryons. vRNPs. assembled in the nucleus and transported to the cytosol. were prevented from reimport into the nucleus. With mutant Ml from ts5l virus direct reimport did take place at the nonpermissive temperature. but this was inhibited by expression of wildtype M1.Conclusions. These data confirm M1's role as the main regulator of the nuclear transport of vRNPs. Specifically. acidic pH was found to be the intracellular cue that allows Ml to carry out its multiple functions in nuclear trafficking.,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=526723150943727727&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

The complexes are heterogeneous in size (4-21S20. W). contain several G glycopolypeptides. and are associated with BiP/GRP78. The newly synthesized. partially intrachain disulfide-bonded G proteins enter these complexes immediately after chain termination. and are released 1-4 min later as fully oxidized. trimerization-competent monomers. These monomers are properly folded. judging by their binding of conformation-specific mAbs. When the G protein is translated in the presence of DTT. it remains reduced. largely unfolded and aggregated in the ER. but it can fold successfully when the DTT is removed. In this case. contrary to normal folding. the aggregates become transiently disulfide cross-linked. We also demonstrated that the fidelity of the folding process is dependent on metabolic energy. Finally. we established that the G protein of the folding mutant of the Vesicular Stomatitis virus. ts045. is blocked at a relatively late step in the folding pathway and remains associated with oligomeric.

Most proteins destined for cell organelles are synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytosol and are translocated into or across the organelle membranes to their functional destination. This intracellular transport of precursor proteins involves several principal steps:(i) the specific targeting of preproteins to the correct organelle via signal sequences on the preproteins and surface receptors on the organelles;(ii) the translocation of the polypeptide chains across the membranes that probably occurs through specific channels;(iii) maturation (proteolytic removal of the signal sequences) and folding of the imported proteins to the functionally active proteins; and (iv) further sorting events such as …,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:AHdEip9mkN0C,0,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00331941,,,,,0

Doris Wall and,1987,A Helenius,,Oncogenes and Growth Factors,,227,Chapman & Hall,The first observation that proteins internalized during endocytosis pass through prelysosomal vacuoles before reaching secondary lysosomes. was made in the early sixties. Werner Straus. working at the University of North Carolina. investigated the endocytic uptake of intravenously administered horseradish peroxidase by rat kidney epithelium1. He used a blue benzidine stain to localize the internalized peroxidase and a red naphthol dye to stain lysosomes which contain acid phosphatase. At early time points. Straus observed that the two enzymes were in separate vacuoles. with the blue peroxidase-containing vacuoles in the peripheral cytoplasm and with the red lysosomes in the perinuclear area. Later. the peroxidase appeared in perinuclear vacuoles and ultimately in the acid phosphatase-positive lysosomes. indicated by the formation of purple vacuoles. Accordingly a function of these prelysosomal vacuoles. which Straus termed'phagosomes'. was to deliver newly internalized material to the secondary lysosomes for digestion. The'phagosomes' were clearly part of the vacuolar apparatus of the cell-the system of membrane-bound bodies. vacuoles and vesicles involved in the uptake and processing of endocytosed (and autophagocytosed) material. Other components of the vacuolar apparatus include lysosomes. autophagosomes. residual bodies. multivesicular bodies. endocytic coated vesicles. certain Golgi elements. etc. 2 Since the demonstration of plasma membrane recycling by Steinman et a/. 3 and receptor-mediated endocytosis of low density lipoproteins by Goldstein et al. 4 in the mid-seventies. the field of pinocytosis and receptor …,True,YtTQLjEAAAAJ:tH6gc1N1XXoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11182521747692276988&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

This could provide a useful approach in treatment of the disease by agents that alter the oxygen atlinity of haemoglobin.

NY 10011,1980,K Simons and A Helenius and B Morein and J Balcorova and M Sharp,25,New Developments with Human and Veterinary Vaccines,,217,AR Liss,The effectiveness of viral vaccines depend on the method used to convert the virus into a vaccine. Whole viruses that have been attenuated or killed have proved effective. but especially the killed virus vaccines have undesirable side effects which limit their use (Chanock et al.. 1975; Ginsberg. 1975; Salk and Salk. 1977). The components in the virus preparations that give rise to the side effects seem not to be important for the protective immune response in the host organism. The preparation of so-called subunit vaccines which contain only the viral antigens needed for immunogenicity has therefore become a central aim in vaccine development.For the enveloped viruses the surface glycoproteins seem to be the antigens responsible for induction of protection (Bachmeyer et al.. 1976; Bolognesi. 1976; Hillemann. 1976; Cox et al.. 1977). However so far no generally applicable method is known for preparing the surface proteins in a form that is effective as a vaccine. The classical methods using a combination of organic solvents and detergent (eg ether and Tween) are known to give subunit preparations which are less potent than killed whole virus vaccines (Ginsberg. 1975; Wright et al.. 1976). This is probably because organic solvents and other denaturing agents such as ionic detergents usually destroy antigenic determinants ci the virus glycoproteins (Helenius and Simons. 1975). Moreover a heterogeneous population of different spike protein aggregates is obtained and the state of aggregation is difficult to control.

Those hybridomas which produced antibodies that bound to the surface of NIH/3T3 cells were propagated and 13 stable cloned lines were established. Antibodies produced by nine of these cell lines contained a gamma heavy chain; and four. the mu chain. The antigenic targets of these antibodies were identified by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell proteins labeled biosynthetically with Pºs] methionine or at the cell surface with'2*. Those labeled polypeptides that were specifically immunoprecipitated had apparent molecular masses of 220. 100. 90. 80. 71 and 55 kilodaltons. Except for the 220.000 and 55.000 dalton proteins. anti-genic activity was lost when the proteins were treated with trypsin.

A restriction fragment of the rDNA containing the IVS and portions of the adjacent rRNA sequences (exons) was inserted downstream from the lac UV5 promoter in a recombinant plasmid.

At high concentrations. single-stranded telomeric DNA can form dimers and tetramers involving G-quartets.

The ability of RNA to catalyze reactions with aminoacyl esters expands the catalytic versatility of RNA and suggests that the first aminoacyl tRNA synthetase could have been an RNA molecule.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:YTuZlYwrTOUC,265,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/256/5062/1420.abstract,9182866285183744006,/scholar?cites=9182866285183744006,,,0

The minimal-length polypeptide required to bind dsRNA contains both dsRBMs. as determined by mobility-shift and filter-binding assays. Mobility-shift experiments indicate binding requires a minimum of 16 base pairs of dsRNA. while a minimal-length site for saturation of longer RNAs is 11 base pairs. Bulge defects in the helix disfavor binding. and single-stranded tails do not strongly influence the dsRNA length requirement. These polypeptides do not bind an RNA−DNA hybrid duplex or dsDNA as judged by either mobility-shift or competition experiments. suggesting 2‘-OH contacts on both strands of the duplex stabilize binding.

In particular. long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). which are so numerous in eukaryotes. function in many cases as transcriptional regulators. These RNAs function through binding to histone-modifying complexes. to DNA binding proteins (including transcription factors). and even to RNA polymerase II. In other cases. it is the act of lncRNA transcription rather than the lncRNA product that appears to be regulatory. We review recent progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs modulate gene expression and future opportunities in this research field.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:NMlhSUseqAsC,262,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/9/eaao2110.short,11813189469886833570,/scholar?cites=11813189469886833570,,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/3/9/eaao2110.full.pdf,0

Inc.,In a living cell the nucleic acids DNA and RNA contain the in formation needed for metabolism and reproduction. Proteins. on the oth er hand. are functional molecules: act ing as enzymes they catalyze each of the thousands of chemical reactions on which cellular metabolism is based. Until recently it was generally accept ed that the categories are exclusive. In deed. the division of labor in the cell between informational and catalytic molecules was a deeply held principle of biochemistry. Within the past few years. however. that neat scheme has been overturned by the discovery that RNA can act as an enzyme. The first example of RNA catalysis was discovered in 1981 and 1982 while my colleagues and I were studying an RNA from the protozoan Tetrahyme na thermophila. Much to our surprise. we found that this RNA can catalyze the cutting and splicing that leads to the removal of part of its own length.

As part of its self-splicing reaction. this ribozyme catalyzes phosphoryl transfer between guanosine and a substrate RNA strand. Here we report the refined crystal structure of an active Tetrahymena ribozyme in the absence of its RNA substrate at 3.8 Å resolution. The 3′-terminal guanosine (ωG). which serves as the attacking group for RNA cleavage. forms a coplanar base triple with the G264-C311 base pair. and this base triple is sandwiched by three other base triples. In addition. a metal ion is present in the active site. contacting or positioned close to the ribose of the ωG and five phosphates. All of these phosphates have been shown to be important for catalysis. Therefore. we provide a picture of how the ribozyme active site positions both a catalytic metal ion and the nucleophilic guanosine for catalysis prior to binding its RNA substrate.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,260,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276504005921,9463063060722686587,/scholar?cites=9463063060722686587,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276504005921,0

We present the Est1p relocation experiment in the context of a working model for the secondary structure of the entire TLC1 RNA. based on thermodynamic considerations and comparative analysis of sequences from four species. The model for TLC1 has three long quasihelical arms that bind the Ku. Est1p. and Sm proteins. These arms emanate from a central catalytic core that contains the template and Est2p-binding region.

As a test of this idea. two retroviral vectors--one encoding a hammer-head ribozyme designed to cleave lacZ transcripts and another encoding the lacZ messenger RNA--were coexpressed inside retroviral packaging cells. Because of the retroviral packaging signal. the ribozyme would be expected to colocalize with the lacZ-containing viral genomic RNA but not with the lacZ messenger RNA. The ribozyme was found to reduce the titer of infectious virus containing lacZ by 90 percent. but had no effect on translation of lacZ messenger RNA.

Cleavage is preceded by base pairing of the substrate to the internal guide sequence (IGS) at the 5'end of the ribozyme to form a short RNA duplex (PI). Tertiary interactions between PI and the catalytic core dock PI into the active site of the ribozyme. These include interactions between the catalytic core and 2/-hydroxyls of the substrate at nucleotide positions-3u and perhaps-2c. In this study. 2/-hydroxyls Of the IGS strand that contribute to PI recognition by the ribozyme are identified.

The reaction is analogous to that catalyzed by a replicase with C5 acting as the primer. GpNs as the nucleoside triphosphates. and a sequence in the ribozyme providing a template.

POT1–TPP1 binding to telomeric DNA activates telomerase repeat addition processivity. We now provide evidence that this POT1–TPP1 activation requires specific interactions with telomerase. rather than it being a DNA substrate-specific effect.

We find that. at steady state. 5-10% of the telomerase RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis contains a poly(A) tail of about 80 nt. In S. cerevisiae. the poly(A)+ fraction quickly disappeared when a conditional pap1 or rna15 mutant was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. indicating that polyadenylation is accomplished by the same machinery that polyadenylates mRNAs. Potential cis-acting polyadenylation elements were identified in the telomerase RNA sequence; when they were mutagenized. the polyadenylation pattern shifted. but was not eliminated.

To determine an upper limit for the number of telomerase molecules in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell. we have established real-time RT-PCR assays to quantify the noncoding telomerase RNA. TLC1. We find that the number of TLC1 molecules in a haploid yeast cell is ∼29. less than the number of chromosome ends (64) in late S-phase.

PKR can also be activated or repressed by a series of cellular and viral RNAs containing non-Watson−Crick motifs. PKR has a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) that contains two tandem copies of the dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM). In vitro selection experiments were carried out to search for RNAs capable of binding to a truncated version of PKR containing the dsRBD. RNA ligands were selected by binding to His6-tagged proteins and chromatography on nickel(II) nitrilotriacetic acid agarose.

University of Colorado. Boulder. Colorado 80309-0215 Received April 23. 1986; Revised Manuscript Received June 2. 1986 abstract: The intervening sequence (IVS) of the Tetrahymena rRNA precursor catalyzes its own splicing. During splicingthe 3'-hydroxyl of guanosine is ligated to the 5'terminus of the IVS. One catalytic strategy of the IVS RNA is to specifically bind its guanosine substrate. Deoxyguanosine (dG) and dideoxyguanosine (ddG) are found to be competitive inhibitors of self-splicing. Comparison of the kinetic parameters (Kt= 1.1 mM for dG; K\= 5.4 mM for ddG; Km=0.032 mM for guanosine) indicates that the ribose hydroxyls are necessary for optimal binding of guanosine to the RNA. dG is not a substrate for the reaction even at very high concentrations.

Here we quantify the tertiary structure contributions of individual hydrogen bonds in a “ribose zipper” motif of the recently crystallized Tetrahymena group I intron P4−P6 domain. The 2‘-hydroxyls of P4−P6 nucleotides C109/A184 and A183/G110 participate in forming the “teeth” of the zipper. These four nucleotides were substituted in all combinations with their 2‘-deoxy and (separately) 2‘-methoxy analogues. and thermodynamic effects on the tertiary folding ΔG°‘ were assayed by the Mg2+ dependence of electrophoretic mobility in nondenaturing gels.

The transcription-processing system includes α-amanitin to inhibit non-rRNA synthesis and aurintricarboxylic acid to inhibit endogenous nucleases. A discrete 0.4 kb RNA comprises up to 6% of the RNA synthesized in this system. Southern hybridization with restriction fragments of the rDNA (rRNA genes) shows that the 0.4 kb RNA contains the intervening sequence. The size of the 0.4 kb RNA. 410–425 nucleotides. is the size predicted if the entire intervening sequence were excised as a single linear molecule.

A selection for viable alleles of TLC1 RNA from a large library of random deletion alleles revealed that less than half (∼0.5 kb of the ∼1.3-kb RNA) is required for telomerase function in vivo. The main essential region (430 nucleotides). which contains the template for telomeric DNA synthesis. was required for coimmunoprecipitation with Est1p and Est2p. Furthermore. the subregion required for interaction with Est1p. the telomerase recruitment subunit. differed from those required for interaction with Est2p. the reverse transcriptase subunit.

Chemical accessibility and UV cross-linking experiments now reveal that self-processing is slow because functional elements are not properly positioned in an active tertiary structure. Folding energy provided by CBP2 drives assembly of two RNA domains that comprise the catalytic core and meditates association of an ∼ 100 nt 5′ domain that contains the 5′ splice site. Thus. the protein assembles RNA secondary structure elements into a specific three-dimensional array while the RNA provides the catalytic center.

The fully folded DNA is not recognized by the Oxytricha telomere-binding protein; the substrate for protein binding has properties consistent with its being partly or fully unfolded.

This process could potentially be disrupted by small ligands that bind specifically to autoantibodies and inhibit their interaction with the target antigen. Here we report the identification of an RNA sequence that binds a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for an autoantigenic epitope of human insulin receptor. The RNA ligand binds specifically and with high affinity (apparent Kd congruent to 2 nM) to the anti-insulin receptor antibody and not to other mouse IgGs. The RNA can also act as a decoy. blocking the antibody from binding the insulin receptor. Thus. it probably binds near the combining site on the antibody. Strikingly. the RNA cross-reacts with autoantibodies from patients with extreme insulin resistance. One simple explanation is that the selected RNA may structurally mimic …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,107,https://www.pnas.org/content/92/6/2355.short,2587461149577264674,/scholar?cites=2587461149577264674,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/92/6/2355.full.pdf,0

In the ciliate Euplotes aediculatus. the protein p43 biochemically co-purifies with active telomerase and appears to be stoichiometric with both the RNA and the catalytic protein subunit of this telomerase complex. Here we describe cloning of the gene for p43 and present evidence that it is an authentic component of the telomerase holoenzyme. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene with peptide sequences of the protein suggests that production of full-length p43 relies on a programmed ribosomal frameshift. an extremely rare translational mechanism.

In the present work. we have investigated the occurrence and stability of these RNA species in vivo. RNA was separated by gel electrophoresis. transferred to diazotized paper. and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes. RNA molecules containing the IVS were found to reside within the nucleus and not in the cytoplasm. The species found in nucleus include both the linear and circular forms of the excised IVS RNA. as well as the unspliced precursor. On the basis of quantitation of the hybridization. the half-lives of the IVS-containing pre-rRNA and the excised IVS RNA in rapidly growing cells were estimated as 2 and 6 s. respectively. We conclude that splicing is not a rate-limiting step in rRNA maturation and that the IVS RNA is quickly degraded after its excision. When the deproteinized nuclear RNA was incubated at 37 degrees C in a Mg2+-containing solution. a substantial portion of the linear IVS RNA was converted to the circular form.

We demonstrate that deletions designed to constrict the DNA-binding ring of Ku80 disrupt nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). telomeric gene silencing. and telomere length maintenance. suggesting that these functions require Ku's DNA end-binding activity. Contrary to the current model. a mutant Ku with low affinity for dsDNA also loses affinity for TLC1 both in vitro and in vivo. Competition experiments reveal that wild-type Ku binds dsDNA and TLC1 mutually exclusively. Cells expressing the mutant Ku are deficient in nuclear accumulation of TLC1. as expected from the RNA-binding defect.

Guanosine (G) is bound by the ribozyme. and its 39-hydroxyl group acts as the nucleophile.

The N-terminal half of the catalytic protein subunit (TERT) contains three functional domains (I. II. and III) that are conserved among TERTs but not found in other reverse transcriptases. Guided by an amino acid sequence alignment of nine TERT proteins. mutations were introduced into yeast TERT (Est2p). In support of the proposed alignment. mutation of virtually all conserved residues resulted in loss-of-function or temperature sensitivity. accompanied by telomere shortening. Overexpression of telomerase component Est3p led to allele-specific suppression of the temperature-sensitive mutations in region I. suggesting that Est3p interacts with this protein domain. As predicted by the genetic results. a lethal mutation in region I resulted in loss of Est3p from the telomerase complex.

Shelterin protects chromosome ends. prevents recognition by the DNA damage machinery. and recruits telomerase. A patch of amino acids. termed the TEL-patch. on the OB-fold domain of the shelterin component TPP1 is essential to recruit telomerase to telomeres. In contrast. the site on telomerase that interacts with the TPP1 OB-fold is not well defined. In this study. we identify separation-of-function mutations in the TEN-domain of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) that disrupt the interaction of telomerase with TPP1 in vivo and in vitro but have very little effect on the catalytic activity of telomerase. Suppression of a TEN-domain mutation with a compensatory charge-swap mutation in the TEL-patch indicates that their association is direct.

The U is the last nucleotide of the 59 exon. and the G is part of the internal guide sequence within the intron. Using site-specific mutagenesis and analysis of the rate and accuracy of splicing of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron. we found that both the U and the G of the U.G pair are important for the first step of self-splicing (attack of GTP at the 59 splice site). Mutation of the U to a purine activated cryptic 59 splice sites in which a U.G pair was restored; this result emphasizes the preference for a U.G at the splice site. Nevertheless. some splicing persisted at the normal site after introduction of a purine. suggesting that position within the P1 helix is another determinant of 59 splice site choice.

Five specific FUS-binding RNA sequence/structure motifs have been proposed. but their affinities for FUS have not been directly compared.

FUS binds RNA in a length-dependent manner. consistent with a substantial non-specific component to binding. Finally. investigation of FUS binding to different nucleic acids shows that it binds single-stranded DNA with three-fold lower affinity than ssRNA of the same length and sequence. while binding to double-stranded nucleic acids is weaker.

Normal form coordinate transforms are a powerful way to untangle interesting long term macroscale dynamics from insignificant detailed microscale dynamics. We explore such coordinate transforms of stochastic differential systems when the dynamics have both slow modes and quickly decaying modes. The thrust is to derive normal forms useful for macroscopic modelling of complex stochastic microscopic systems. Thus we not only must reduce the dimensionality of the dynamics. but also endeavour to separate all slow processes from all fast time processes. both deterministic and stochastic. Quadratic stochastic effects in the fast modes contribute to the drift of the important slow modes.

The catalytic core of telomerase consists of the RNA subunit and a protein reverse transcriptase subunit. known as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). It has previously been shown that both yeast and human telomerase can form dimers or multimers in which one RNA in the complex can influence the activity of another. To test the proposal that dimerization might be essential for telomerase activity. we sought to determine whether Tetrahymena thermophila telomerase is active as a dimer or a monomer. Recombinant Tetrahymena telomerase eluted from a gel filtration column at the size of a monomeric complex (one RNA plus one TERT). and those fractions showed processive telomerase activity.

The position of the cross-link was mapped by using three independent methods: RNase H digestion. primer extension with reverse transcriptase. and partial hydrolysis of end-labeled RNA. The cross-link is chemically unusual in that it joins two adenosines. A57 and A95. Formation of this cross-link depends upon the identity and concentration of divalent cations presentand upon heat-cool renaturation of the IVS in a manner that parallels conditions required for optimal catalytic activity. Furthermore. cross-linking requires the presence of sequences within the core structure. which is conserved among group I intervening sequences and necessary for catalytic activity.

In the catalytic center of the Tetrahymena group I intron. helices P4 and P6 are part of a tertiary structural domain that folds independently of the remainder of the intron. When P4 and P6 were fused with a phosphodiester linkage. the resulting RNA retained the detailed tertiary interactions characteristic of the native P4-P6 domain and even required lower magnesium ion concentrations for folding. These results indicate that P4 and P6 are coaxial in the P4-P6 domain and. therefore. in the native ribozyme.

However. the mechanisms used to achieve RNA import are largely unknown. In particular. the RNA elements that direct import have not been identified in any organism. In Tetrahymena. only one of three nuclear-encoded glutamine accepting tRNAs is imported into mitochondria. We transform Tetrahymena with marked glutamine tRNAs and quantitate their level of accumulation in mitochondria. Of several isostructural nucleotide substitutions tested. alteration of the anticodon sequence uniquely abolishes import. Furthermore. substitution of a single anticodon nucleotide (UUA-->UUG) confers import on a normally nonimported glutamine tRNA. Thus. the anticodon functions as a mitochondrial localization signal and is both necessary and sufficient for tRNA import.

48479,A novel two-step genome editing strategy with CRISPR-Cas9 provides new insights into telomerase action and TERT gene expression,2015,Linghe Xi and Jens C Schmidt and Arthur J Zaug and Dante R Ascarrunz and Thomas R Cech,16,Genome biology,1,1-17,BioMed Central,To facilitate indefinite proliferation. stem cells and most cancer cells require the activity of telomerase. which counteracts the successive shortening of telomeres caused by incomplete DNA replication at the very end of each chromosome. Human telomerase activity is often determined by the expression level of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). the catalytic subunit of the ribonucleoprotein complex. The low expression level of TERT and the lack of adequate antibodies have made it difficult to study telomerase-related processes in human cells. To overcome the low CRISPR-Cas9 editing efficiency at the TERT locus. we develop a two-step “pop-in/pop-out” strategy to enrich cells that underwent homologous recombination (HR). Using this technique. we fuse an N-terminal FLAG-SNAP-tag to TERT. which allows us to reliably detect TERT in western blots. immunopurify it for biochemical analysis. and determine its subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. TERT co-localizes detectably with only 5–7 % of the telomeres at a time in S-phase HeLa cells; no nucleolar localization is detected. Furthermore. we extend this approach to perform single base-pair modifications in the TERT promoter; reverting a recurrent cancer-associated TERT promoter mutation in a urothelial cancer cell line results in decreased telomerase activity. indicating the mutation is causal for telomerase reactivation. We develop a two-step CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy to introduce precise modifications at the endogenous TERT locus in human cell lines. This method provides a useful tool for studying telomerase biology. and suggests a general approach to …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:nVrZBo8bIpAC,68,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0791-1,5609231980642442298,/scholar?cites=5609231980642442298,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0791-1,0

The latter family. which we call “main-band hydroxyapatite-isolated rapidly renaturing DNA”. has a kinetic complexity about an order of magnitude greater than that of mouse satellite DNA. It shows about twice as much mismatching as renatured mouse satellite. as judged by its thermal denaturation curve.

The recent discovery of telomeric RNA raises the question of how POT1 faithfully binds telomeric ssDNA and avoids illicit RNA binding that could result in its depletion from telomeres. Here we show through binding studies that a single deoxythymidine in a telomeric repeat dictates the DNA versus RNA discrimination by human POT1 and mouse POT1A. We solve the crystal structure of hPOT1 bound to DNA with a ribouridine in lieu of the critical deoxythymidine and show that this substitution results in burying the 2′-hydroxyl group in a hydrophobic region (Phe62) of POT1 in addition to eliminating favorable hydrogen-bonding interactions at the POT1–nucleic acid interface.

The Tetrahymena intervening sequence (IVS) has been inserted into the gene for the alpha-donor fragment of beta-galactosidase in a recombinant plasmid. Production of functional beta-galactosidase is dependent on RNA splicing in vivo in Escherichia coli. Thus RNA self-splicing can occur at a rate sufficient to support gene expression in a prokaryote. despite the likely presence of ribosomes on the nascent RNA.

The structural components involved in recognition of the 5' splice site have been identified. but the mechanism by which the 3' splice site is recognized is not established. To identify some components of 3'splice site recognition. we have generated mutations near the 3' splice site and determined their effects on self-splicing. Alteration of the 3'-terminal guanosine of the intervening sequence (IVS). a conserved nucleotide in group I IVSs. almost eliminated 3' splice site activity; the IVS-3' exon splicing intermediate accumulated. and exon ligation was extremely slow. These mutations do not result in recruitment of cryptic 3' splice sites. in contrast to mutations that affect the 5' splice site.

We first confirmed that SRAP is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. where it is expressed at the level of about 105 molecules per cell. However. our SRAP–RNA binding experiments. both in vitro with recombinant protein and in cultured cells with plasmid-expressed protein and RNA. did not reveal a specific interaction between SRAP and SRA. We determined the crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal domain of human SRAP and found that it does not have the postulated RRM (RNA recognition motif). The structure is a five-helix bundle that is distinct from known RNA-binding motifs and instead is similar to the carboxy-terminal domain of the yeast spliceosome protein PRP18. which …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:ZzlSgRqYykMC,28,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283614000448,7110669802428113535,/scholar?cites=7110669802428113535,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc4043375/,0

Yet in the United States their ranks are shrinking. creating a serious bottleneck in the pathway to new types of treatment. To encourage the best and brightest physicians to choose careers in clinical research. the US scientific enterprise must address a fundamental problem: the high cost of medical education.Clinical research is most often carried out by multidisciplinary teams of investigators led by physician-scientists who can bridge the gap between basic research and the health of the patient or the public.

Using mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant human PRC2. we identified three methylated lysine residues (K510. K514. and K515) on a disordered but highly conserved loop of EZH2. Methylation of these lysines increases PRC2 histone methyltransferase activity. whereas their mutation decreases activity in vitro. De novo histone methylation in an EZH2 knockout cell line is greatly impeded by mutation of the automethylation lysines. EZH2 automethylation occurs intramolecularly (in cis) by methylation of a pseudosubstrate sequence on a flexible loop. This posttranslational modification and cis regulation of PRC2 are analogous to the activation of many protein …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:nqdriD65xNoC,27,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/33/19-20/1416.short,9906775624266418775,/scholar?cites=9906775624266418775,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/33/19-20/1416.full.pdf,0

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku heterodimer is unusual in that it has two very different biologically relevant binding modes: (1) Ku is a sequence-nonspecific double-stranded DNA end-binding protein with prominent roles in nonhomologous end-joining and telomeric capping. and (2) Ku associates with a specific stem–loop of TLC1. the RNA subunit of budding yeast telomerase. and is necessary for proper nuclear localization of this ribonucleoprotein enzyme. TLC1 RNA-binding and dsDNA-binding are mutually exclusive. so they may be mediated by the same site on Ku.

Mutations in the DAXX gene have been found frequently in both telomerase-positive and ALT cells. and how DAXX mutations contribute to cancers remains unclear. We report here that endogenous DAXX can localize to Cajal bodies. associate with the telomerase and regulate telomerase targeting to telomeres. Furthermore. disease mutations that are located in different regions of DAXX differentially impact on its ability to interact with its binding partners and its targeting to Cajal bodies and telomeres. In addition. DAXX knockdown by RNA interference led to reduced telomerase targeting to telomeres and telomere shortening.

In the first step. base pairing between the ribozyme internal guide sequence (IGS) and the substrate forms a helical duplex (P1). Through specific tertiary interactions between P1 and the ribozyme core. P1 is then docked into the ribozyme active site. We have investigated the effects of compensatory mutations in positions 2−6 of the P1 helix on docking of P1 into the ribozyme core. Equilibrium binding of matching oligonucleotides by catalytically active IGS mutant ribozymes was evaluated by gel-shift analysis. While the strength of base pairing changed with base composition as expected. the strength of tertiary interactions between P1 and the ribozyme core was not affected by the P1 mutations.

48628,Building a catalytic active site using only RNA,1998,Thomas R Cech and Barbara L Golden,,"The RNA World, 2nd Edn. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY",,321-349,,Two of the most fundamental requirements for life are information storage and catalytic function. Without storage. transfer. and replication of information. a system cannot learn from its past and improve its viability; that is. there can be no natural selection. Equally essential to life is catalytic (enzymatic) function. At the very least. there must be machinery to catalyze the copying of the informational molecules. This process must proceed with considerable fidelity. yet some frequency of errors is also necessary to provide the diversity that allows adaptation and evolution. Beyond replication of the genome. additional catalytic functions would be highly advantageous to provide basic metabolism for even a primitive self-reproducing system.In contemporary organisms information is stored in the form of DNA. However. the persistence of RNA genomes in many viruses shows us that this sister nucleic acid is competent for information storage. at least for small genomes. Biocatalytic function in the modern world is mostly the domain of protein enzymes. although ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) still catalyze the essential cellular reactions of protein synthesis and RNA splicing. By what evolutionary pathway did this DNA-RNA-protein solution to the problem of life come about?

The standard deviation of the size of each end group is independent of the mean size of the end group. The two sides of the mtDNA have different multimodal distributions of repeats. Cloned cell lines have multimodal distributions of mtDNA telomeres distinct from that of the original cell line. The number of telomere end groups and the average size of the end groups change in an erratic fashion as the cells are passaged and do not reach a stable equilibrium distribution in 185 generations.

While partial or full deletions of lncRNA loci disrupt lncRNA expression. they do not permit the formal association of a phenotype with the encoded transcript. Here. we examined several alternative strategies for generating lncRNA null alleles in zebrafish and found that they often resulted in unpredicted changes to lncRNA expression. Removal of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of lncRNA genes resulted in hypomorphic mutants. due to the usage of either constitutive or tissue-specific alternative TSSs. Deletions of short. highly conserved lncRNA regions can also lead to overexpression of truncated transcripts.

Our recent studies have shown that fusion pores of granules harboring Syt-1 expand more rapidly than those harboring Syt-7. Here we sought to define the structural specificity of synaptotagmin action at the fusion pore by manipulating the Ca2+-binding C2B module. We generated a chimeric Syt-1 in which its C2B Ca2+-binding loops had been exchanged for those of Syt-7. Fusion pores of granules harboring a Syt-1 C2B chimera with all three Ca2+-binding loops of Syt-7 (Syt-1:7C2B123) exhibited slower rates of fusion pore expansion and neuropeptide cargo release relative to WT Syt-1.

Because telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is usually the limiting component for telomerase activation. numerous studies have measured TERT mRNA levels in populations of cells or in tissues. In comparison. little is known about TERT expression at the single-cell and single-molecule level. To address this. we analyzed TERT expression across 10 human cancer lines using single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and made several unexpected findings. First. there was substantial cell-to-cell variation in number of transcription sites and ratio of transcription sites to gene copies.

48645,Telomerase in bladder cancer: back to a better future,2014,Dan Theodorescu and Thomas R Cech,65,Eur Urol,2,370-1,,Proper maintenance of chromosomes requires dealing with two biological challenges: the chromosome end-protection problem and the chromosome end-replication problem [1]. The first challenge stems from the need to distinguish the ends of linear chromosomes. which predominate in eukaryotes. from broken DNA ends that require repair. The second challenge stems from the gradual loss of sequence information at the extreme end of chromosomes. owing to incomplete replication by DNA polymerases (which only synthesize DNA in the 50 to 30 direction and are unable to fill in the gap left behind upon removal of the 50-most RNA primer). Telomerase. a unique enzyme that contains telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and a template-containing RNA component (telomerase RNA [TR]). extends telomeric DNA to solve both problems. In mammals. the action of telomerase is required for the survival of continuously dividing cells such as embryonic cells and adult stem cells. These cells have relatively high levels of telomerase activity. whereas most somatic cells. which have a limited replicative lifespan. have very low or undetectable telomerase activity. Inactivation of telomerase in these latter cells is achieved mostly by transcriptional downregulation of the TERT gene. which encodes the essential. catalytically active protein subunit of the enzyme [2]. TERT protein associates with the essential TR subunit of the enzyme. which templates telomere extension. and with other protein factors to form the active holoenzyme that maintains telomere length [1].

Evidently. both life and mind are among the possibilities in our universe. on our Earth. for here we are; but can we give an account of how those possi-bilities became actual? Hopefully. it can be a scientific account; but then. too. depending somewhat on how the possibilities become actual. and where the possibilities come from. we may need also a philosophical account. a metaphysical account. Such an account will also. sooner or later. need to become evaluative. Life has to be defended and. more. life ought to be defended. There is something about respect for life that is vital. both in the biological and the philosophical senses. Such evaluation will generate an ethics for the moral species and also for the larger community of life on Earth. Life requires. as Cech points out. information flow. The secret of life is storing and using vital information. In that sense. when biology arises on Earth. there arises something more than just the matter and energy with which the physical sciences are concerned.

Their discovery not only provided insight regarding the molecular basis of reproduction of the genetic material. but also led to an intense effort to understand how the information encoded in DNA was expressed. 1. 2 Of course. it was this latter line of inquiry that led to what for many of us is an even more interesting nucleic acid. RNA.Like DNA. RNA can form a double helix with two polynucleotide strands held together by complementary base pairs. However. in nature RNA is most often a single-stranded molecule. Not locked into a duplex. it is free to assume any of a variety of structures. These structures include (1) intramolecular helices capped by hairpin loops;(2) interactions of these loops. including pseudoknots and tetraloop-helix minor groove interactions;(3) additional base pairs. triples and in some cases tetrads;(4) structured internal loops; and (5) undoubtedly a host of as-yet-unknown tertiary interactions. 3-8 In addition ribonucleic acid has a hydrogen bonding moiety not found in DNA. the 2’OH. As will be discussed herein. this functional group may provide one of the keys for a nucleic acid to be able to form a specific tertiary structure from what would otherwise be a loose collection of helical elements. 9. 10 Some RNA molecules use combinations of these structural elements to form specific. stable catalytic centers for biochemical reactions.

Here. we report the 3.0-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of human CST bound to telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). which assembles as a decameric supercomplex. The atomic model of the 134-kilodalton CTC1 subunit. built almost entirely de novo. reveals the overall architecture of CST and the DNA-binding anchor site. The carboxyl-terminal domain of STN1 interacts with CTC1 at two separate docking sites. allowing allosteric mediation of CST decamer assembly. Furthermore. ssDNA appears to staple two monomers to nucleate decamer assembly. CTC1 has stronger structural similarity to Replication Protein A than the expected similarity to yeast Cdc13.

Telomerase normally adds telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends. Here. we engineer human and Tetrahymena cis-telomerase RNAs. each having a DNA primer covalently linked to its 3′ end. We find that cis-telomerase synthesizes DNA with increased repeat addition processivity (RAP) but does not completely rescue the RAP defect of the L14A mutant of Tetrahymena TERT. This supports the conclusion that L14 has a function beyond binding the DNA primer and preventing dissociation during multiple rounds of repeat addition. By comparing cis-telomerases with various linker lengths. we find that a 5 nt linker gives near-optimal activity. indicating that the distance between the 3′ end of the telomerase RNA pseudoknot region and the 5′ end of the DNA primer is ∼33 Å.

48666,Ribosomal RNA gene expression in Tetrahymena: transcription and RNA splicing,1986,THOMAS R Cech,,The Molecular Biology of the Ciliated Protozoa,,203-225,Academic Press,Ribosomal RNA gene expression in eukaryotes is a multistep process. RNA polymerase synthesizes a high molecular weight rRNA precursor within which are embedded three of the four RNA components of the ribosome. The pre-rRN A is matured via a number of RNA processing steps. including modiﬁcation of nucleosides and cleavage of the chain by nucleases. In some cases the primary transcript includes an intervening sequence (IVS) which is removed by RNA splicing. a cleavage—ligation reaction. Assembly of the RNA into ribonucleopro-tein particles begins during transcription. and it is in the form of preribosomal particles that the rRNA is processed and ultimately transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.The ribosomal RNA genes of Tetrahymena have proved useful for studies of rRNA gene expression because they are at the same time typical and atypical. In many respects. these genes are classic eukaryotic rRNA transcription units. They are located in nucleoli. They are organized in a nucleosome chromatin structure with DNase I sensitivity characteristic of transcriptionally active chromatin (see Gorovsky. Chapter 9). They are transcribed by an a-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase 1. Each gene contains coding sequences in the order 5'-17 S—5.8 S—26 S—3'. with the coding region bordered by nontranscribed spacers.

Here. we visualized the binding of PRC2 to naked DNA in liquid at the single-molecule level using atomic force microscopy. Analysis of the resulting images showed PRC2. consisting of five subunits (EZH2. EED. SUZ12. AEBP2 and RBBP4). bound to a 2.5-kb DNA with an apparent dissociation constant () of 150 ± 12 nM.

Yet. there has been surprisingly little analysis of the spatio-temporal regulation of individual protein-coding and non-coding RNA molecules in single cells. Here we address how intron retention influences the spatio-temporal dynamics of transcripts from two clinically relevant genes: TERT (Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase) pre-mRNA and TUG1 (Taurine-Upregulated Gene 1) lncRNA. Single molecule RNA FISH revealed that nuclear TERT transcripts uniformly and robustly retain two specific introns whose splicing occurs during mitosis. In contrast. TUG1 has a bimodal distribution of fully spliced cytoplasmic and intron-retained nuclear transcripts. We further test the functionality of intron-retention events using RNA-targeting thiomorpholino antisense oligonucleotides to block intron excision. We show that intron retention is the driving force for the nuclear compartmentalization of these RNAs. For both RNAs. altering this splicing-driven subcellular distribution had significant effects on cell growth. Together. these findings show that stable retention of specific introns can orchestrate spatial compartmentalization of RNAs within the cell; this process reveals new targets for RNA-based therapies.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:xyvS_IvSCKsC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.21.212514v1.abstract,15850237138984614716,/scholar?cites=15850237138984614716,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/22/2020.07.21.212514.full.pdf,0

The atomic model of the 134 kDa CTC1. built almost entirely de novo. reveals the overall architecture of CST and the DNA-binding anchor site. In situ arrangements of STN1 and TEN1 are revealed. with STN1 interacting with CTC1 at two separated sites. allowing allosteric mediation of CST decameric assembly. Surprisingly. CTC1 lacks the anticipated structural homology to yeast Cdc13 but instead shares similarity with a form of Replication Protein A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104. 8791–8796. 2007) was in general agreement with our study of the structure and function of the N-terminal domain of Tetrahymena telomerase reverse transcriptase. However. the two studies disagreed on the effect of a mutation of Trp187 on catalysis. with our study reporting a severe reduction in activity. Upon sequencing the entire gene encoding our W187A mutant. we found that it had a second distant mutation (R812W) in motif C of the reverse transcriptase domain. and we demonstrated that it was the mutation at position 812 that abolished catalytic activity. In addition. we confirmed that authentic W187A telomerase has catalytic activity similar to that of wild-type telomerase. Both studies concur that Trp187 is physically close to the primer-binding site. and in fact Romi et al. have mapped Trp187 as a site of photo-cross-linking to a telomeric DNA primer.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:LGlY6t8CeOMC,1,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsmb1007-984a,14904541656743975468,/scholar?cites=14904541656743975468,,,0

We have developed a method that involves extending peripheral helices of an RNA. mounting for electron microscopy in the absence of protein and measuring interhelical angles.

Single. double and triple extensions (50-80 bp) of helical elements P2. 1. P6b and P8 of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme did not alter its catalytic activity. The measured angle between P6b and P8 is consistent with the Michel-Westhof structural model. while the P2. 1-P6b and P2. 1-P8 angles allow P2. 1 to be positioned in the model. The angle distributions of the ribozyme are broader than those of the tRNA. which may reflect the dynamics of the RNA.

Boston. MA,In some species of the ciliated protozoan. Tetrahymena. the genes for the large rRNA (ribosomal RNA) are interrupted by an IVS (intervening sequence or intron) approximately 400 base pairs in size (Wild and Gall. 1979). The genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I to give a pre-rRNA that contains the IVS (Din et al.. 1979; Cech and Rio. 1979). The pre-rRNA is then subject to an RNA processing reaction called RNA splicing. by which the IVS is excised and the exons or flanking sequences are ligated. RNA splicing is required for the expression of most mRNA genes and some rRNA and tRNA genes in the nuclei of eukaryotes. and is also involved in the expression of some mitochondrial and chloroplast genes.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-5173-3_24,17334338296361072151,/scholar?cites=17334338296361072151,,,0

Two mutually exclusive subcomplexes. PRC2.1 and PRC2.2. are defined by the set of accessory proteins bound to the core PRC2 subunits. Here we introduce separation-of-function mutations into the SUZ12 subunit of PRC2 to drive it into a PRC2.1 or 2.2 subcomplex in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We find that PRC2.2 occupies polycomb target genes at low levels and that homeobox transcription factors are upregulated when this complex is exclusively present. In contrast with previous studies. we find that chromatin occupancy of PRC2 increases drastically when it is forced to form PRC2.1. Additionally. several cancer-associated mutations also coerce formation of PRC2.1.

This process is essential for embryonic stem cell (ESCs) pluripotency. differentiation. and development. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) can both read and write H3K27me3. enabling progressive spread of H3K27me3 on the linear genome. Long-range Polycomb-associated DNA contacts have also been described. but their regulation and role in gene silencing remains unclear. Here. we apply H3K27me3 HiChIP. a protein-directed chromosome conformation method. and optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture to profile long-range Polycomb-associated DNA loops that span tens to hundreds of megabases across multiple topological associated domains in mouse ESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that H3K27me3 loop anchors are enriched for Polycomb nucleation points and coincide with key developmental genes. such as Hmx1. Wnt6 and Hoxa. Genetic deletion of H3K27me3 loop anchors revealed a coupling of Polycomb-associated genome architecture and H3K27me3 deposition evidenced by disruption of spatial contact between distant loci and altered H3K27me3 in cis. both locally and megabases away on the same chromosome.

Because telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is usually the limiting component for telomerase activation. numerous studies have measured TERT mRNA levels in populations of cells or in tissues. However. little is known about TERT expression at the single-cell and single-molecule level. Here we analyzed TERT expression across 10 human cancer lines using single-molecule RNA FISH and made several unexpected findings. First. there was substantial cell-to-cell variation in number of transcription sites and ratio of transcription sites to gene copies. Second. previous classification of lines as having monoallelic or biallelic TERT expression was found to be inadequate for capturing the TERT gene expression patterns. Finally. TERT mRNA had primarily nuclear localization in cancer cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). in stark contrast to the expectation that mature mRNA should be predominantly cytoplasmic.

Telomerase is active in stem cells. enabling maintenance of the telomeres. while it is normally inactive in somatic cells. leading to telomeres progressively shortening until a critical length triggers cell senescence or apoptosis. Importantly. telomerase is pathogenically reactivated in approximately 80–90% of human cancers. The expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). the catalytic subunit of telomerase. specifically appears to be crucial to telomerase's tightly regulated activities; the Cech lab and others have shown that an absence of TERT expression is what prevents telomerase activity in human cells.

Our goal is to understand the structural basis for telomerase activity and regulation. Towards that end. we have determined the high‐resolution crystal structure of a portion of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). the Telomerase Essential N‐terminal (TEN) domain from Tetrahymena thermophila. The structure represents a novel mixed alpha‐beta fold with a C‐terminal extension that becomes ordered only upon interaction with other macromolecules. The positively charged C‐terminus is involved in binding RNA in a sequence‐nonspecific manner. analogous in a general sense to the interactions of certain ribosomal proteins with ribosomal RNA. These C‐terminal amino acids. as well as conserved amino acids in a deep groove on the surface of the domain. are critical …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.20.5.A984-c,,,,,0

Furthermore. instead of relying on short peptides. RNA could now make use of well-folded proteins. Importantly. because the proteins were now genetically encoded. they too were subject to evolution; the RNA and RNA-binding proteins began to coevolve.The reader may have encountered protein–nucleic acid interactions primarily in the guise of proteins that bind double-stranded DNA. Relative to RNA. dsDNA has a very regular. predictable shape. Yes. it can be straight or bent. and in extreme cases can even adopt a left-handed conformation called Z-DNA. Mostly. however. it is a trustworthy righthanded double helix. with the phosphodiester backbones on the outside and only the edges of the bases accessible from the major and minor grooves. Proteins such as repressors or transcription factors or restriction endonucleases can track along the double helix. and then clamp down when they encounter a sequence of bases with which they can make hydrogen bonds. In contrast. RNA can form an essentially limitless number of structures. so RNA-binding proteins recognize base sequence as it is presented by the shape of the RNA. In discussing contemporary RNA–protein complexes. we take an RNA-centric viewpoint. RNA–protein interactions will be categorized not according to whether the protein uses-sheets or-helices or loops to recognize the RNA. but instead according to what sort of structure the …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:RXiHnyRawswC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17222442337519168993&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0

Since then. there has been an explosion of knowledge about both the RNA and protein subunits of this unusual ribonucleoprotein enzyme in organisms ranging from the ciliates to yeast to humans. The regulation of telomerase is now understood to take place both at the level of synthesis of the enzyme and via the state of its substrate. the telomere itself. The roles of telomerase in both cellular immortality and cancer are vibrant areas of current research.Here we show that eg telomerases are an attractive target for the development of an anti-cancer drug.

Then he turned to a discussion of the role of protein catalysts. termed enzymes. in speeding up reactions in cells. a role that in effect makes life's properties possible. Until the early 1980's. only such enzymes were thought to have catalytic ability in cells.

Enzymes. biological catalysts found in all cells. greatly accelerate the rates of these chemical reactions and impart on them extraordinary specificity.In 1926. James B. Sumner crystallized the enzyme urease and found that it was a protein. Skeptics argued that the enzymatic activity might reside in a trace component of the preparation rather than in the protein (Haldane. 1930). and it took another decade for the generality of Sumner's finding to be established. As more and more examples of protein enzymes were found. it began to appear that biological catalysis would be exclusively the realm of proteins.

48766,Tetrahymena Telomerase Protein p65 Induces Conformational Changes throughout Telomerase RNA (TER) and Rescues Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase and TER Assembly Mutants▿,,Thomas R Cech and Anne R Gooding and Andrea J Berman,,,,,,The biogenesis of the Tetrahymena telomerase ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) is enhanced by p65. a La family protein. Single-molecule and biochemical studies have uncovered a hierarchical assembly of the RNP. wherein the binding of p65 to stems I and IV of telomerase RNA (TER) causes a conformational change that facilitates the subsequent binding of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) to TER. We used purified p65 and variants of TERT and TER to investigate the conformational rearrangements that occur during RNP assembly. Nuclease protection assays and mutational analysis revealed that p65 interacts with and stimulates conformational changes in regions of TER beyond stem IV. Several TER mutants exhibited telomerase activity only in the presence of p65. revealing the importance of p65 in promoting the correct RNP assembly pathway. In addition. p65 rescued TERT assembly mutants but not TERT activity mutants. Taken together. these results suggest that p65 stimulates telomerase assembly and activity in two ways. First. by sequestering stems I and IV. p65 limits the ensemble of structural conformations of TER. thereby presenting TERT with the active conformation of TER. Second. p65 acts as a molecular buttress within the assembled RNP. mutually stabilizing TER and TERT in catalytically active conformations.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:Vno172sVVMwC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/gx41mj41j,,,,,0
48767,RNA Recognition by the DNA End-Binding Ku Heterodimer,,Jennifer S Pfingsten and Karen J Goodrich and Thomas R Cech and Andrew B Dalby,,,,,,Most nucleic acid-binding proteins selectively bind either DNA or RNA. but not both nucleic acids. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ku heterodimer is unusual in that it has two very different biologically relevant binding modes:(1) Ku is a sequence-nonspecific double-stranded DNA end-binding protein with prominent roles in nonhomologous end-joining and telomeric capping. and (2) Ku associates with a specific stem–loop of TLC1. the RNA subunit of budding yeast telomerase. and is necessary for proper nuclear localization of this ribonucleoprotein enzyme. TLC1 RNA-binding and dsDNA-binding are mutually exclusive. so they may be mediated by the same site on Ku. Although dsDNA binding by Ku is well studied. much less is known about what features of an RNA hairpin enable specific recognition by Ku. To address this question. we localized the Ku-binding site of the TLC1 hairpin with single-nucleotide resolution using phosphorothioate footprinting. used chemical modification to identify an unpredicted motif within the hairpin secondary structure. and carried out mutagenesis of the stem–loop to ascertain the critical elements within the RNA that permit Ku binding. Finally. we provide evidence that the Ku-binding site is present in additional budding yeast telomerase RNAs and discuss the possibility that RNA binding is a conserved function of the Ku heterodimer.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/q237hs63r,,,,,0
48768,Multiple POT1–TPP1 Proteins Coat and Compact Long Telomeric Single-Stranded DNA,,Dylan J Taatjes and Thomas R Cech and Derek J Taylor and Elaine R Podell,,,,,,Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap and protect the ends of linear chromosomes. In humans. telomeres end in 50–300 nt of G-rich single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) overhangs. Protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) binds with nanomolar affinity to the ssDNA overhangs and forms a dimer with another telomere-end binding protein called TPP1. Whereas most previous studies utilized telomeric oligonucleotides comprising single POT1–TPP1 binding sites. here. we examined 72-to 144-nt tracts of telomeric DNA containing 6–12 POT1–TPP1 binding sites. Using electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays. size-exclusion chromatography. and electron microscopy. we analyzed telomeric nucleoprotein complexes containing POT1 alone. POT1–TPP1. and a truncated version of POT1 (POT1-N) that maintains its DNA-binding domain. The results revealed that POT1-N and POT1–TPP1 can completely coat long telomeric ssDNA substrates. Furthermore. we show that ssDNA coated with human POT1–TPP1 heterodimers forms compact. potentially ordered structures.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:WWeOtg8bX_EC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/7h149q544,,,,,0
48769,Global Expression Changes Resulting from Loss of Telomeric DNA in Fission Yeast,,Thomas A Volpe and Thomas R Cech and Jürg Bähler and Robert A Martienssen and Jeffrey G Mandell,,,,,,Background Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells lacking the catalytic subunit of telomerase (encoded by trt1⁺) lose telomeric DNA and enter crisis. but rare survivors arise with either circular or linear chromosomes. Survivors with linear chromosomes have normal growth rates and morphology. but those with circular chromosomes have growth defects and are enlarged. We report the global gene-expression response of S. pombe to loss of trt1⁺. Results Survivors with linear chromosomes had expression profiles similar to cells with native telomeres. whereas survivors with circular chromosomes showed continued upregulation of core environmental stress response (CESR) genes. In addition. survivors with circular chromosomes had altered expression of 51 genes compared to survivors with linear chromosomes. providing an expression signature. S. pombe progressing through crisis displayed two waves of altered gene expression. One coincided with crisis and consisted of around 110 genes. 44% of which overlapped with the CESR. The second was synchronized with the emergence of survivors and consisted of a single class of open reading frames (ORFs) with homology both to RecQ helicases and to dhrepeats at centromeres targeted for heterochromatin formation via an RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism. Accumulation of transcript from the ORF was found not only in trt1⁻ cells. but also indcr1⁻ and ago1⁻ RNAi mutants. suggesting that RNAi may control its expression.

48770,Local RNA Structural Changes Induced by Crystallization are Revealed by SHAPE,,Alain Laederach and Anna R Gooding and Thomas R Cech and Quentin Vicens,,,,,,We present a simple approach to locate sites that undergo conformational changes upon crystallization by comparative structural mapping of the same RNA in three different environments. As a proof of principle. we probed the readily crystallized P4–P6ΔC209 domain from the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron in a native solution. in a solution mimicking the crystallization drop. and in crystals. We chose the selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry. which monitors the flexibility and the conformation of each nucleotide. First. SHAPE successfully revealed the structural changes that occur during the crystallization process. Specifically. 64% of the nucleotides implicated in packing contacts and present in the portion of the molecule analyzed were identified. Second. reactivity differences for some of these nucleotides were already observed in the crystallization solution. suggesting that the crystallization buffer locked down a particular structure that was favorable to crystal formation. Third. the probing of a known structure extends our understanding of the structural basis for the SHAPE reaction by suggesting that reactivity is enhanced by a C2′-endo sugar pucker. Furthermore. by identifying local conformational changes of the RNA that take place during crystallization. SHAPE could be combined with the in vitro selection of stable mutants to rationalize the design of RNA candidates for crystallization.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:aEW5N-EHWIMC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/gq67jr83k,,,,,0
48771,Multiple Yeast Genes. Including Paf1 Complex Genes. Affect Telomere Length via Telomerase RNA Abundance,,Thomas R Cech and Elaine R Podell and Amy D Mozdy,,,,,,Twofold reductions in telomerase RNA levels cause telomere shortening in both humans and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To test whether multiple genes that affect telomere length act by modulating telomerase RNA abundance. we used real-time reverse transcription-PCR to screen S. cerevisiae deletion strains reported to maintain shorter or longer telomeres to determine the levels of their telomerase RNA (TLC1) abundance. Of 290 strains screened. 5 had increased TLC1 levels; 4 of these maintained longer telomeres. Twenty strains had decreased TLC1 levels; 18 of these are known to maintain shorter telomeres. Four strains with decreased TLC1 RNA levels contained deletions of subunits of Paf1C (polymerase II-associated factor complex). While Paf1C had been implicated in the transcription of both polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNAs. Paf1C had not been associated previously with the noncoding telomerase RNA. In Paf1C mutant strains. TLC1 overexpression partially rescues telomere length and cell growth defects. suggesting that telomerase RNA is a critical direct or indirect Paf1C target. Other factors newly identified as affecting TLC1 RNA levels include cyclin-dependent kinase. the mediator complex. protein phosphatase 2A. and ribosomal proteins L13B and S16A.

48772,The Euplotes Telomerase Subunit p43 Stimulates Enzymatic Activity and Processivity in vitro,,Thomas R Cech and Stefan Aigner,,,,,,Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that synthesizes telomeric DNA repeats at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Although it is minimally composed of a conserved catalytic protein subunit (TERT) and an RNA component. additional accessory factors present in the holoenzyme play crucial roles in the biogenesis and function of the enzyme complex. Telomerase from the ciliate Tetrahymenacan be reconstituted in active form in vitro. Using this system. we show that p43. a telomerase-specific La-motif protein from the ciliate Euplotes. stimulates activity and increases repeat addition processivity of telomerase. Activity enhancement by p43 requires its incorporation into a TERT• RNA• p43 ternary complex but is independent of other dissociable protein factors functioning in telomerase complex assembly. Stimulation is enhanced at elevated temperatures. supporting a role for p43 in structural stabilization of a critical region of the RNA subunit. To our knowledge. this represents the first demonstration that an authentic telomerase accessory protein can directly affect the enzymatic activity of the core enzyme in vitro.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:PlWzFYVEG4EC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/kp78gh09s,,,,,0
48773,Nucleic acid-binding specificity of human FUS protein.,,Jacob C Schwartz and Xueyin Wang and Thomas R Cech,,,,,,FUS. a nuclear RNA-binding protein. plays multiple roles in RNA processing. Five specific FUS-binding RNA sequence/structure motifs have been proposed. but their affinities for FUS have not been directly compared. Here we find that human FUS binds all these sequences with Kd (app) values spanning a 10-fold range. Furthermore. some RNAs that do not contain any of these motifs bind FUS with similar affinity. FUS binds RNA in a length-dependent manner. consistent with a substantial non-specific component to binding. Finally. investigation of FUS binding to different nucleic acids shows that it binds single-stranded DNA with three-fold lower affinity than ssRNA of the same length and sequence. while binding to double-stranded nucleic acids is weaker. We conclude that FUS has quite general nucleic acid-binding activity. with the various proposed RNA motifs being neither necessary for FUS binding nor sufficient to explain its diverse binding partners.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:wyM6WWKXmoIC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/s1784m45f,,,,,0
48774,Protection of Telomeres by the Ku Protein in Fission Yeast,,Thomas R Cech and Peter Baumann,,,,,,Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells survive loss of telomeres by a unique pathway of chromosome circularization. Factors potentially involved in this survival mechanism include the heterodimeric Ku protein and ligase IV. both of which are involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells. Furthermore. Ku plays a role in telomere maintenance as well as in DNA double-strand break repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have identified Ku and ligase IV homologues in S. pombe and analyzed their functions during normal growth and in cells undergoing senescence. In the absence of either a Ku subunit (pku70+) or ligase IV (lig4+). nonhomologous DNA end-joining was severely reduced. Lack of functional Ku led to shorter but stable telomeres and caused striking rearrangements of telomere-associated sequences. indicating a function for Ku in inhibiting recombinational activities near chromosome ends. In contrast to S. cerevisiae. concurrent deletion ofpku70+ and the gene for the catalytic subunit of telomerase (trt1+) was not lethal. allowing for the first time the dissection of the roles of Ku during senescence. Our results support a model in which Ku protects chromosome termini from nucleolytic and recombinational activities but is not involved in the formation of chromosome end fusions during senescence. The conclusion that nonhomologous end-joining is not required for chromosome circularization was further supported by analysis of survivors in strains lacking the genes for bothtrt1+ and lig4+.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:rOcdG6UcVlcC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/h702q701m,,,,,0
48775,N-terminal Domain of Yeast Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase: Recruitment of Est3p to the Telomerase Complex,,David M Long and Jeremy J Heit and Thomas R Cech and Katherine L Friedman,,,,,,Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that maintains chromosome ends. The N-terminal half of the catalytic protein subunit (TERT) contains three functional domains (I. II. and III) that are conserved among TERTs but not found in other reverse transcriptases. Guided by an amino acid sequence alignment of nine TERT proteins. mutations were introduced into yeast TERT (Est2p). In support of the proposed alignment. mutation of virtually all conserved residues resulted in loss-of-function or temperature sensitivity. accompanied by telomere shortening. Overexpression of telomerase component Est3p led to allele-specific suppression of the temperature-sensitive mutations in region I. suggesting that Est3p interacts with this protein domain. As predicted by the genetic results. a lethal mutation in region I resulted in loss of Est3p from the telomerase complex. We conclude that Est2p region I is required for the recruitment of Est3p to yeast telomerase. Given the phylogenetic conservation of region I of TERT. this protein domain may provide the equivalent function in all telomerases.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:xGWFX6Gbr9MC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/bg257f76f,,,,,0

We have now identified homologous proteins in fission yeast and in humans. These Pot1 (protection oftelomeres) proteins each bind the G-rich strand of their own telomeric repeat sequence. consistent with a direct role in protecting chromosome ends. Deletion of the fission yeastpot1⁺ gene has an immediate effect on chromosome stability. causing rapid loss of telomeric DNA and chromosome circularization.

48777,Structure and Function of Steroid Receptor RNA Activator Protein. the Proposed partner of SRA noncoding RNA,,Linghe Xi and Thomas R Cech and Kristen KB Barthel and David B McKay,,,,,,In a widely accepted model. the steroid receptor RNA activator protein (SRA protein; SRAP) modulates the transcriptional regulatory activity of SRA RNA by binding a specific stem–loop of SRA. We first confirmed that SRAP is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of MCF-7 breast cancer cells. where it is expressed at the level of about 10⁵ molecules per cell. However. our SRAP–RNA binding experiments. both in vitro with recombinant protein and in cultured cells with plasmid-expressed protein and RNA. did not reveal a specific interaction between SRAP and SRA. We determined the crystal structure of the carboxy-terminal domain of human SRAP and found that it does not have the postulated RRM (RNA recognition motif). The structure is a five-helix bundle that is distinct from known RNA-binding motifs and instead is similar to the carboxy-terminal domain of the yeast spliceosome protein PRP18. which stabilizes specific protein–protein interactions within a multisubunit mRNA splicing complex. SRA binding experiments with this domain gave negative results. Transcriptional regulation by SRA/SRAP was examined with siRNA knockdown. Effects on both specific estrogen-responsive genes and genes identified by RNA-seq as candidates for regulation were examined in MCF-7 cells. Only a small effect (~ 20% change) on one gene resulting from depletion of SRA/SRAP could be confirmed. We conclude that the current model for SRAP function must be reevaluated; we suggest that SRAP may function in a different context to stabilize specific intermolecular interactions in the nucleus.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/gm80hv85m,,,,,0
48778,Human Pot1 (Protection of Telomeres) Protein: Cytolocalization Gene Structure. and Alternative Splicing,,Thomas R Cech and Peter Baumann and Elaine Podell,,,,,,Fission yeast Pot1 (protection of telomeres) is a single-stranded telomeric DNA binding protein with a critical role in ensuring chromosome stability. A putative human homolog (hPot1) was previously identified. based on moderate sequence similarity with fission yeast Pot1 and telomere end-binding proteins from ciliated protozoa. Using indirect immunofluorescence. we show here that epitope-tagged hPot1 localizes to telomeres in interphase nuclei of human cells. consistent with a direct role in telomere end protection. The hPOT1 gene contains 22 exons. most of which are present in all cDNAs examined. However. four exons are subject to exon skipping in some transcripts. giving rise to five splice variants. Four of these are ubiquitously expressed. whereas the fifth appears to be specific to leukocytes. The resultant proteins vary significantly in their ability to form complexes with single-stranded telomeric DNA as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition to these splice variants. the Pot1 family is expanded by the identification of six more genes from diverse species. Pot1-like proteins have now been found in plants. animals. yeasts. and microsporidia.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:H7nrzBkawXsC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/qn59q468w,,,,,0
48779,Many Disease-Associated Variants of hTERT Retain High Telomerase Enzymatic Activity,,Kristina Campbell and Arthur J Zaug and Sharon M Crary and Matthew Jesse Fioravanti and Thomas R Cech,,,,,,Mutations in the gene for telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) are associated with diseases including dyskeratosis congenita. aplastic anemia. pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. Understanding the molecular basis of these telomerase-associated diseases requires dependable quantitative measurements of telomerase enzyme activity. Furthermore. recent findings that the human POT1-TPP1 chromosome end-binding protein complex stimulates telomerase activity and processivity provide incentive for testing variant telomerases in the presence of these factors. In the present work. we compare multiple disease-associated hTERT variants reconstituted with the RNA subunit hTR in two systems (rabbit reticulocyte lysates and human cell lines) with respect to telomerase enzymatic activity. processivity and activation by telomere proteins. Surprisingly. many of the previously reported disease-associated hTERTalleles give near-normal telomerase enzyme activity. It is possible that a small deficit in telomerase activity is sufficient to cause telomere shortening over many years. Alternatively. mutations may perturb functions such as the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres. which are essential in vivo but not revealed by simple enzyme assays.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:I8rxH6phXEkC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/d504rm04x,,,,,0
48780,Ku Can Contribute to Telomere Lengthening in Yeast at Multiple Positions in the Telomerase RNP,,Lisa A Gurski and David C Zappulla and Elizabeth M Denham and Thomas R Cech and Julian R Arthur and Anne E Stellwagen and Karen J Goodrich,,,,,,Unlike ribonucleoprotein complexes that have a highly ordered overall architecture. such as the ribosome. yeast telomerase appears to be much more loosely constrained. Here. we investigate the importance of positioning of the Ku subunit within the 1157-nt yeast telomerase RNA (TLC1). Deletion of the 48-nt Ku-binding hairpin in TLC1 RNA (tlc1Δ48) reduces telomere length. survival of cells with gross chromosomal rearrangements. and de novo telomere addition at a broken chromosome end. To test the function of Ku at novel positions in the telomerase RNP. we reintroduced its binding site into tlc1Δ48 RNA at position 446 or 1029. We found that Ku bound to these repositioned sites in vivo and telomere length increased slightly. but statistically significantly. The ability of telomerase to promote survival of cells with gross chromosomal rearrangements by healing damaged chromosome arms was also partially restored. whereas the kinetics of DNA addition to a specific chromosome break was delayed. Having two Ku sites in TLC1 caused progressive hyperelongation of a variable subset of telomeres. consistent with Ku's role in telomerase recruitment to chromosome ends. The number of Ku-binding sites in TLC1 contributed to telomerase RNA abundance in vivo but was only partially responsible for telomere length phenotypes. Thus. telomerase RNA levels and telomere length regulation can be modulated by the number of Ku sites in telomerase RNA. Furthermore. there is substantial flexibility in the relative positioning of Ku in the telomerase RNP for native telomere length maintenance. although not as much flexibility as for the essential Est1p …,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:yTLRzDEmwhEC,0,http://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/6w924c60m,,,,,0
48781,A Template-proximal RNA Paired Element Contributes to S. cerevisiae Telomerase Activity,,Anita G Seto and Arthur J Zaug and Kfir Umansky and Elizabeth H Blackburn and Thomas R Cech and Yehuda Tzfati,,,,,,The ribonucleoprotein complex telomerase is critical for replenishing chromosome-end sequence during eukaryotic DNA replication. The template for the addition of telomeric repeats is provided by the RNA component of telomerase. However. in budding yeast. little is known about the structure and function of most of the remainder of the telomerase RNA. Here. we report the identification of a paired element located immediately 5′ of the template region in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase RNA. Mutations disrupting or replacing the helical element showed that this structure. but not its exact nucleotide sequence. is important for telomerase function in vivo and in vitro. Biochemical characterization of a paired element mutant showed that the mutant generated longer products and incorporated noncognate nucleotides. Sequencing of in vivo synthesized telomeres from this mutant showed that DNA synthesis proceeded beyond the normal template. Thus. the S. cerevisiae element resembles a similar element found in Kluyveromyces budding yeasts with respect to a function in template boundary specification. In addition. the in vitro activity of the paired element mutant indicates that the RNA element has additional functions in enzyme processivity and in directing template usage by telomerase.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:RMgMIBzvq-4C,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/1n79h492f,,,,,0

We found that FUS binds the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) and prevents inappropriate hyperphosphorylation of Ser2 in the RNAP2 CTD at thousands of human genes. The loss of FUS leads to RNAP2 accumulation at the transcription start site and a shift in mRNA isoform expression toward early polyadenylation sites. Thus. in addition to its role in alternative RNA splicing. FUS has a general function in orchestrating CTD phosphorylation during RNAP2 transcription.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:Y0-TYkg6YM4C,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/b8515p198,,,,,0
48783,Fission yeast telosomes: non-canonical histone-containing chromatin structures dependent on shelterin and RNA.,,Thomas R Cech and Julia Promisel Cooper and Harshil Patel and Jessica Greenwood,,,,,,Despite the prime importance of telomeres in chromosome stability. significant mysteries surround the architecture of telomeric chromatin. Through micrococcal nuclease mapping. we show that fission yeast chromosome ends are assembled into distinct protected structures ('telosomes') encompassing the telomeric DNA repeats and over half a kilobase of subtelomeric DNA. Telosome formation depends on the conserved telomeric proteins Taz1 and Rap1. and surprisingly. RNA. Although yeast telomeres have long been thought to be free of histones. we show that this is not the case; telomere repeats contain histones. While telomeric histone H3 bears the heterochromatic lys9-methyl mark. we show that this mark is dispensable for telosome formation. Therefore. telomeric chromatin is organized at an architectural level. in which telomere-binding proteins and RNAs impose a unique nucleosome arrangement. and a second level. in which histone modifications are superimposed upon the higher order architecture.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:In6cVmBjs0IC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/b8515p07g,,,,,0
48784,A dimeric state for PRC2.,,Anne R Gooding and Chen Davidovich and Thomas R Cech and Karen J Goodrich,,,,,,Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) is a histone methyltransferase required for epigenetic silencing during development and cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can recruit PRC2 to chromatin. Previous studies identified PRC2 subunits in a complex with the apparent molecular weight of a dimer. which might be accounted for by the incorporation of additional protein subunits or RNA rather than PRC2 dimerization. Here we show that reconstituted human PRC2 is in fact a dimer. using multiple independent approaches including analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC combined with multi-angle light scattering and co-immunoprecipitation of differentially tagged subunits. Even though it contains at least two RNA-binding subunits. each PRC2 dimer binds only one RNA molecule. Yet. multiple PRC2 dimers bind a single RNA molecule cooperatively. These observations suggest a model in which the first RNA binding event promotes the recruitment of multiple PRC2 complexes to chromatin. thereby nucleating repression.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:tz746QTLzJkC,0,https://scholar.colorado.edu/concern/articles/7p88ch29h,,,,,0

48787,Allele-Specific DNA Methylation and Its Interplay with Repressive Histone Marks at Promoter-Mutant TERT Genes.,,James C Costello and Richard D Paucek and Josh Lewis Stern and Ronald Nwumeh and Thomas R Cech and Mahmoud Ghandi and Franklin W Huang,,,,,,A mutation in the promoter of the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) gene is the most frequent noncoding mutation in cancer. The mutation drives unusual monoallelic expression of TERT. allowing immortalization. Here. we find that DNA methylation of the TERT CpG island (CGI) is also allele-specific in multiple cancers. The expressed allele is hypomethylated. which is opposite to cancers without TERT promoter mutations. The continued presence of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) on the inactive allele suggests that histone marks of repressed chromatin may be causally linked to high DNA methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis. TERT promoter DNA containing 5-methyl-CpG has much increased affinity for PRC2 in vitro. Thus. CpG methylation and histone marks appear to collaborate to maintain the two TERT alleles in different epigenetic states in TERT promoter mutant cancers. Finally. in several cancers.

48791,Binding of the CBP2 protein to a yeast mitochondrial group I,,A Gampel and TR Cech,,,,,,The yeast CBP2 gene product is required for the splicing of the terminal intron (bI5) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b pre-mRNA in vivo. In vitro. bI5 RNA self-splices efficiently only at high MgCI2 concentrations (50 mM); at 5 mM MgCI2. efficient splicing requires purified CBP2 protein. To determine the sequences within bI5 recognized by the protein. we have constructed deletion and substitution mutants of the RNA. Their binding to CBP2 was assessed by their ability to inhibit protein-dependent splicing of the wild-type bI5 RNA. Several regions. including the large LI and L8 loops. can be deleted without affecting binding. They can therefore be eliminated from consideration as critical recognition elements. In contrast. other changes prevent the RNA from binding CBP2 and also impair self-splicing. Thus. either the catalytic core contacts the protein directly. or the integrity of the core is required for proper display of other RNA sequences that bind the protein. The results are consistent with a model in which the CBP2 protein facilitates splicing by binding to and stabilizing the active structure of the RNA. However. a more specific model is proposed in which the protein specifically enhances Mg 2 § binding required for catalysis.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex_Gampel/publication/21240256_Binding_of_the_CBP2_protein_to_a_yeast_mitochondrial_group_I_intron_requires_the_catalytic_core_of_the_RNA/links/0deec52a1a48c761f9000000.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alex_Gampel/publication/21240256_Binding_of_the_CBP2_protein_to_a_yeast_mitochondrial_group_I_intron_requires_the_catalytic_core_of_the_RNA/links/0deec52a1a48c761f9000000.pdf,0

you're thinking ... sushi in Ja- maica? How good could that be. right? Much to our delight. it was 
better than much of the sushi we were used to in Chicago. Ruel Dionisio. the Detroit-trained sushi 
chef who worked for sheiks in Dubai before being lured to the Grand Lido Negril. had his fish 
flown in fresh directly from Mi- ami to ensure that his restaurant received top sushi-grade 
seafood. “When I first got here. I had to train the staff on how to prepare sashimi [raw fish] and 
sushi. be- cause they were used to cooking the heck out of the fish.” Dionisio said. “Sushi was 
truly a foreign concept to them. But they caught on quickly and the guests love hav- ing this as

48793,In vivo selection of better self-splicing introns in Escherichia coli,,Feng Guo and Thomas R Cech,,,,,,In vivo selection was used to improve the activity of the Tetrahymena pre-rRNA self-splicing intron in the context of heterologous exons. The intron was engineered into a kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase gene. with the pairing between intron bases and the 59 and 39 splice sites maintained. The initial construct failed to confer kanamycin resistance on Escherichia coli. although the pre-mRNA was active in splicing in vitro. Random mutation libraries were constructed to identify active intron variants in E. coli. All the active mutants sequenced contained mutations disrupting a base-paired region above the paired region P1 (referred to as the P1 extension region or P1ex) that involves the very 59 end of the intron. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that these P1ex mutations are responsible and sufficient to activate the intron splicing in E. coli. Thus. it appears that too strong of a secondary structure in the P1ex element can be inhibitory to splicing in vivo. In vitro splicing assays demonstrated that two P1ex mutant constructs splice six to eight times faster than the designed construct at 40 mM GTP concentration. The relative reaction rates of the mutant constructs compared to the original design are further increased at a lower GTP concentration. Possible mechanisms by which the disrupted P1ex structure could influence splicing rates are discussed. This study emphasizes the value of using libraries of random mutations to improve the activity of ribozymes in heterologous contexts in vivo.,True,KC-1Xe0AAAAJ:mel-f30kHHgC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Feng_Guo17/publication/11350176_Guo_F_Cech_TR_In_vivo_selection_of_better_self-splicing_introns_in_Escherichia_coli_the_role_of_the_P1_extension_helix_of_the_Tetrahymena_intron_RNA_8_647-658/links/550307f90cf231de076fcdef/Guo-F-Cech-TR-In-vivo-selection-of-better-self-splicing-introns-in-Escherichia-coli-the-role-of-the-P1-extension-helix-of-the-Tetrahymena-intron-RNA-8-647-658.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Feng_Guo17/publication/11350176_Guo_F_Cech_TR_In_vivo_selection_of_better_self-splicing_introns_in_Escherichia_coli_the_role_of_the_P1_extension_helix_of_the_Tetrahymena_intron_RNA_8_647-658/links/550307f90cf231de076fcdef/Guo-F-Cech-TR-In-vivo-selection-of-better-self-splicing-introns-in-Escherichia-coli-the-role-of-the-P1-extension-helix-of-the-Tetrahymena-intron-RNA-8-647-658.pdf,0

48801,and Comparative Mechanistic Analysis,,TR CECH and D HERSCHLAG,,,,,,This 10th Anniversary Issue of Nucleic Acids & Molecular Biology provides an occasion to look back on progress in understanding group I intron splicing and catalysis over the past 10 years. By 1985 the sequential steps in RNA selfsplicing had been described (Zaug and Cech 1982) and the secondary structure common to group I introns had been determined (Davies et al. 1982; Michel et al. 1982; Waring and Davies 1984). Furthermore. several fungal mitochondrial introns and one from bacteriophage T4 had joined the Tetrahymena rRNA intron on the list of self-splicers (Garriga and Lambowitz 1984; Chu et al. 1985; van der Horst and Tabak 1985). In 1985. two related questions provided major goals for the next decade:(1) What is the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of the group E intron?(2) How is transition state stabilization achieved? While these questions had been articulated (eg. Cech and Bass 1986). it was not at all clear how they could be productively approached. let alone answered.Now. 10 years later. neither'question has been answered. but substantial progress has been made on both.(1) A detailed three-dimensional model of the group I intron catalytic center was developed in France. and its general architecture and many of the proposed specific contacts have withstood the test of diverse experiments (see Jaeger et al.. this Vol.).(2) Methods have been developed for measuring the thermodynamics and kinetics of individual steps in the catalytic RNA (ribozyme) reaction.

Compared with unimodal inputs. semantically and/or spatially congruent multisensory cues speed discrimination and improve reaction times. Discordant inputs have the opposite effect. reducing performance and slowing responses. These behavioural features of crossmodal processing appear to have parallels in the response properties of multisensory cells in the superior colliculi and cerebral cortex of non-human mammals. Although spatially concordant multisensory inputs can produce a dramatic. often multiplicative. increase in cellular activity. spatially disparate cues tend to induce a profound response depression.Results: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). we investigated whether similar indices of crossmodal integration are detectable in human cerebral …,True,78KRfbkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1091,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982200005133,10779423469593804437,/scholar?cites=10779423469593804437,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982200005133,0

Here we show in an Icelandic sample that a few of the CNVs clearly alter fecundity (measured as the number of children by age 45). Furthermore. we use various tests of cognitive function to demonstrate that control subjects carrying the CNVs perform at a level that is between that of schizophrenia patients and population controls.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has consistently been associated with both phonologic and semantic operations in functional neuroimaging studies. Two main theories have proposed a different functional organization in the LIFG for these processes. One theory suggests an anatomic parcellation of phonologic and semantic operations within the LIFG. An alternative theory proposes that both processes are encompassed within a supramodal executive function in a single region in the LIFG. To test these theories. we carried out a systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies employing phonologic and semantic verbal fluency tasks.

Lesion evidence suggests that the subjective experience of fear relies upon amygdala-medial frontal activity (as well as autonomic arousal). whereas the factual context of threat stimuli depends upon hippocampal-lateral frontal activity. This amygdala-hippocampus dissociation has not previously been demonstrated in vivo. To explore this differentiation. we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) measures of phasic arousal. while subjects viewed fearful versus neutral faces. fMRI activity was subaveraged according to whether or not the subject evoked an arousal SCR to each discrete face stimulus. The fMRI-with arousal and fMRI-without arousal data provided a distinct differentiation of amygdala and hippocampal networks.

It is as if the object in our mind’s eye comes alive and continues on its course. This phenomenon is known as representational momentum and results in a distortion of recognition memory in the implied direction of motion. Representational momentum is modifiable; simply labelling a drawing of a pointed object as ‘rocket’ will facilitate the effect. whereas the label ‘steeple’ will impede it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural substrate for representational momentum.Results: Subjects participated in two experiments.

We argue that model evaluation based on testing the null hypothesis that the correlation matrix predicted by the model equals the population correlation matrix is problematic because P values are conditional on asymptotic distributional results (which may not be valid for fMRI data acquired in less than 10 min). as well as arbitrary specification of residual variances and effective degrees of freedom in each regional fMRI time series. We introduce an alternative approach based on an algorithm for automatic identification of the best fitting model that can be found to account for the data.

We focus on three applications in particular: (i) wavelet coefficient resampling or “wavestrapping” of 1-D time series. 2- to 3-D spatial maps and 4-D spatiotemporal processes; (ii) wavelet-based estimators for signal and noise parameters of time series regression models assuming the errors are fractional Gaussian noise (fGn); and (iii) wavelet shrinkage in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks to support multiresolution hypothesis testing …,True,78KRfbkAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,256,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811904003775,3525332260103830909,/scholar?cites=3525332260103830909,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01128152/document,0

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can reveal localized changes in blood oxygenation in response to actual as well as imagined sensory stimulation. The safe repeatability of fMRI enabled us to study a patient with schizophrenia while he was experiencing auditory hallucinations and when hallucination-free (with supporting data from a second case). Cortical activation was measured in response to periodic exogenous auditory and visual stimulations using time series regression analysis. Functional brain images were obtained in each hallucination condition both while the patient was on and off antipsychotic drugs. The response of the temporal cortex to exogenous auditory stimulation (speech) was markedly reduced when the patient was experiencing hallucinating voices addressing him. regardless of medication.

We report that a left-lateralised fronto-parietal network is engaged during phonological similarity judgements made in both English (rhyme) and British Sign Language (BSL; location). Since these languages operate in different modalities. these data suggest that the neural network supporting phonological processing is. to some extent. supramodal. Activation within this network was however modulated by language (BSL/English). hearing status (deaf/hearing). and age of BSL acquisition (native/non-native). The influence of language and hearing status suggests an important role for the posterior portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus in speech-based phonological processing in deaf people.

However these approaches focus on finding group differences and are not applicable to situations where one is interested in accessing deviations from a specific class or population. In the present work we propose an application of the one-class SVM (OC-SVM) to investigate if patterns of fMRI response to sad facial expressions in depressed patients would be classified as outliers in relation to patterns of healthy control subjects. We defined features based on whole brain voxels and anatomical regions. In both cases we found a significant correlation between the OC-SVM predictions and the patients' Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). i.e. the more depressed the patients were the more of an outlier they were.

Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by stereotyped/obsessional behaviours and social and communicative deficits. However. there is significant variability in the clinical phenotype; for example. people with autism exhibit language delay whereas those with Asperger syndrome do not. It remains unclear whether localized differences in brain anatomy are associated with variation in the clinical phenotype.Method. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate brain anatomy in adults with ASD. We included 65 adults diagnosed with ASD (39 with Asperger syndrome and 26 with autism) and 33 controls who did not differ significantly in age or gender.Results. VBM revealed that subjects with ASD had a significant reduction in grey-matter volume of medial temporal. fusiform and cerebellar regions. and in white matter of the brainstem and cerebellar regions. Furthermore. within the subjects with ASD. brain anatomy varied with clinical phenotype. Those with autism demonstrated an increase in grey matter in frontal and temporal lobe regions that was not present in those with Asperger syndrome.Conclusions.

Twelve right-handed male volunteers read a mixture of metaphoric and literal sentences. each sentence being followed by a single word. which could be semantically related or not to the preceding sentence context. We found that judging unrelated words as contextually irrelevant was associated with increased blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in the metaphoric but not in the literal condition. The same region was also activated when subjects endorsed a semantic relation between words and metaphoric sentence primes but not between words and literal sentence primes.

It proceeds by transforming the data into the wavelet domain and permuting the wavelet coefficients.

Inc.,Analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data requires the application of techniques that are able to identify small signal changes against a noisy background. Many of the most commonly used methods cannot deal with responses which change amplitude in a fashion that cannot easily be predicted. One technique that does hold promise in such situations is wavelet analysis. which has been applied extensively to time‐frequency analysis of nonstationary signals.

This study compares the neurofunctional modulation and normalization effects of acute doses of MPH and ATX within medication-naive ADHD boys during working memory (WM).  Method A total of 20 medication-naive ADHD boys underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a parametric WM n-back task three times. under a single clinical dose of either MPH. ATX or placebo in a randomized. double-blind. placebo-controlled. cross-over design. To test for normalization effects. brain activations in ADHD under each drug condition were compared with that of 20 age-matched healthy control boys.  Results Relative to healthy boys. ADHD boys under placebo showed impaired performance only under high WM load together with significant underactivation in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Both drugs normalized the performance deficits relative to controls. ATX significantly enhanced right DLPFC activation relative to MPH within patients. and significantly normalized its underactivation relative to controls. MPH. by contrast. both relative to placebo and ATX. as well as relative to controls. upregulated the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC). but only during 2-back.

The phenomenon of coloured hearing synaesthesia (in which individuals see colours when they hear or see words) appears to contradict the second of these inferences.

Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). few reliable predictors of treatment outcome have been identified. The present study examined the neural correlates of symptom improvement with CBT among OCD patients with predominantly contamination obsessions and washing compulsions. the most common OCD symptom dimension.Method. Participants consisted of 12 OCD patients who underwent symptom provocation with contamination-related images during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning prior to 12 weeks of CBT.Results. Patterns of brain activity during symptom provocation were correlated with a decrease on the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) after treatment. even when controlling for baseline scores on the YBOCS and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and improvement on the BDI during treatment. Specifically. activation in brain regions involved in emotional processing. such as the anterior temporal pole and amygdala. was most strongly associated with better treatment response. By contrast. activity in areas involved in emotion regulation. such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. correlated negatively with treatment response mainly in the later stages within each block of exposure during symptom provocation.Conclusions. Successful recruitment of limbic regions during exposure to threat cues in patients with contaminationbased OCD may facilitate a better response to CBT. whereas excessive activation of dorsolateral prefrontal regions involved in cognitive control may hinder response to treatment.

Linear scale-space features are derived from the short-echo. proton-density (PD)-weighted images. The second-order Gaussian derivative (the Laplacian) operator is applied at three different spatial scales as a measure of image convexity/concavity with a first-order Gaussian derivative measure (the squared gradient) at a single scale used to circumscribe cortical regions.

Radius of gyration (Rg) is a measure of the mean dispersion of points in a radially organized structure about that structure's centre of gravity. We developed computerized methods for estimating Rg of the magnetic resonance image (MRI) boundary between cortex and subcortex. and applied these methods to measurement of cerebral hemispheric asymmetry in 37 schizophrenics (SZs) and 30 controls (CONs). In right-handed CONs. Rg of right brain boundaries was significantly greater than Rg of left brain boundaries; in lefthanded CONs. Rg of left brain boundaries was significantly greater than Rg of right brain boundaries. In right-handed males (both SZ and CON). there were significant differences in Rg between hemispheres; whereas in females (both SZ and CON) there were no such differences. Righthanded male SZs (N= 26) were distinguished by reversal of the right-handed male CON pattern of interhemispheric difference in Rg. and by global reduction in Rg of right brain boundaries. There was no evidence for significant abnormality of Rg in right-handed female SZs (N= 7).

We derive here a parametric approach to voxel-based meta-analysis. based on spatial statistics. In this method. the value of each voxel in the meta-analysis summary map reflects the proportion of studies reporting an activation within a specified local neighborhood. We threshold this map by testing whether voxel scores could have been expected had the activation peaks been generated at random locations. Our aim is to detect ‘signal’ regions. with scores that are unlikely to arise under such null hypothesis. The method is applicable to both fixed-effects (in which each study is considered as deriving from the same generating process) and random-effects (in which the process varies across studies) meta-analysis.

Impaired spatial working memory (SWM) is a robust feature of schizophrenia and has been linked to the risk of developing psychosis in people with an at-risk mental state (ARMS). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural substrate of SWM in the ARMS and in patients who had just developed schizophrenia.Method. fMRI was used to study 17 patients with an ARMS. 10 patients with a first episode of psychosis and 15 agematched healthy comparison subjects. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response was measured while subjects performed an object–location paired-associate memory task. with experimental manipulation of mnemonic load.Results. In all groups. increasing mnemonic load was associated with activation in the medial frontal and medial posterior parietal cortex. Significant between-group differences in activation were evident in a cluster spanning the medial frontal cortex and right precuneus. with the ARMS groups showing less activation than controls but greater activation than first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients. These group differences were more evident at the most demanding levels of the task than at the easy level. In all groups. task performance improved with repetition of the conditions.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we explored the effects of age on the brain activation and functional connectivity of 32 male participants from 10 to 53 years of age during a time discrimination task that required the discrimination of temporal intervals of seconds differing by several hundred milliseconds. Increasing development was associated with progressive activation increases within left lateralised dorsolateral and inferior fronto-parieto-striato-thalamic brain regions. Furthermore. despite comparable task performance. adults showed increased functional connectivity between inferior/dorsolateral interhemispheric fronto-frontal activation as well as between inferior fronto-parietal regions compared with adolescents. Activation in caudate. specifically. was associated with both increasing age and better temporal discrimination.

Employing a double-blind. repeated-measures design. we investigated the genetic and neural basis of variable sensitivity to cannabis-induced behavioural dyscontrol in healthy occasional cannabis users. Acute oral challenge with placebo or Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging. while participants performed a response inhibition task that involved inhibiting a prepotent motor response. They were genotyped for rs1130233 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the protein kinase B (AKT1) gene.Results. Errors of inhibition were significantly (p= 0.008) increased following administration of THC in carriers of the A allele. but not in G allele homozygotes of the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP. The A allele carriers also displayed attenuation of left inferior frontal response with THC evident in the sample as a whole. while there was a modest enhancement of inferior frontal activation in the G homozygotes. There was a direct relationship (r=− 0.327. p= 0.045) between the behavioural effect of THC and its physiological effect in the inferior frontal gyrus. where AKT1 genotype modulated the effect of THC.Conclusions.

A consistently observed neurofunctional deficit is in fine-temporal discrimination (TD). The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to examine the feasibility of distinguishing patients with ADHD from controls using multivariate pattern recognition analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of TD.A total of 20 medication-naive adolescent male patients with ADHD and 20 age-matched healthy controls underwent fMRI while performing a TD task. The fMRI data were analyzed with Gaussian process classifiers to predict individual ADHD diagnosis based on brain activation patterns.The pattern of brain activation correctly classified up to 80% of patients and 70% of controls. achieving an overall …,True,78KRfbkAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC,35,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856714000471,9800990312467743793,/scholar?cites=9800990312467743793,,,0

This is therapeutically useful in the management of a variety of gynaecological conditions but also serves as a powerful model to study the effects of ovarian hormones on cognition. Animal and human behavioral studies report that memory is particularly sensitive to the effects ovarian hormone suppression (e.g. post GnRHa). Further. it has recently been reported that ovariectomy in young women increases the risk of cognitive impairment in later life. However. the underlying brain networks and/or stages of memory processing that might be modulated by acute ovarian hormone suppression remain poorly understood. We used event-related fMRI to examine the effect of GnRHa on visual working memory (VWM).

Inc.. A Wiley Company,During verbal‐fluency tasks. impairments in performance and functional abnormalities in the inferior frontal cortex have been observed in both schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives. We sought to examine whether such functional abnormalities are a specific marker of genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. We studied a sample of 132 subjects. comprising 39 patients with schizophrenia. 10 unaffected monozygotic (MZ) cotwins of schizophrenia probands. 28 patients with bipolar disorder. 7 unaffected MZ cotwins of bipolar disorder probands and 48 healthy controls.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the core components of language processing as well as the impact of task demand in a group of bipolar subjects.Methods:  Twelve euthymic dextral male BD I participants receiving lithium monotherapy were matched with 12 controls. Groups were matched for age. years of education and estimated premorbid IQ. We employed a factorial design manipulating task demand (decision versus fluency) and task domain (phonetic versus semantic) to investigate differences in language processing between groups and across different task domains and requirements. Data were fitted to haemodynamic response models convolved to the experimental design.

Our results show that perception of red-black and green-black grids activate the right fusiform gyrus (area V4) plus the left and right lingual gyri. right striate cortex (V1) and left insula. The ME activated the left anterior fusiform gyrus as well as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. and in common with colour perception. the left insula. These data confirm the critical role of the fusiform gyrus in actual and illusory colour perception as well as revealing localized frontal cortical activation associated with the ME. which would suggest that a ‘top-down’mechanism is implicated in this illusion.,True,78KRfbkAAAAJ:sfnaS5RM6jYC,34,https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/fulltext/1999/01180/the_functional_anatomy_of_the_mccollough.37.aspx,1584971259718563282,/scholar?cites=1584971259718563282,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1057.8419&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0

Intrasynaptosomal Ca2+ concentrations have been varied by the use of Ca‐EGTA buffers or by adding the onophore A23187 in the presence and absence of 1 mM Ca2+. The former studies have revealed that. at very low (20 nM) intrasynaptosomal free Ca2+ levels. inositol pisphos‐phate. but not inositol monophosphate levels are reduced. Addition of A23187 in the absence of added Ca2+ gives rise to greatly enhanced inositol bisphosphate accumulation. which is further enhanced if 1 mM Ca2+ is present in the extrasynaptosomal medium. At all time points examined (down to 2 s after adding ionophore). the ratio of inositol trisphosphate/inositol bisphosphate accumulation does not exceed 0.2. and calculations based on inositol bis‐ and …,True,78KRfbkAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC,34,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-4159.1989.tb07348.x,2056620237788597845,/scholar?cites=2056620237788597845,,,0

Subsequent addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 in the presence of 2 mM extrasynaptosomal Ca2+ raised intrasynaptosomal free [Ca2+] to >2 μM from a resting level of 200 nMand led to rapid breakdown of polyphosphoinositides. This was accompanied by a small increase in the level of inositol monophosphate. greatly enhanced accumulation of inositol bisphosphate. but no detectable increase in inositol trisphosphate. Depolarising (25 mM) extrasynaptosomal K+ produced a smaller increase in intrasynaptosomal free [Ca2+] (to around 400 nM) and a proportional increase in inositol bisphosphate radioactivity.
