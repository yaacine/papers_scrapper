1231232,Segmentation of brain MR images through a hidden Markov random field model and the expectation-maximization algorithm,2001,Yongyue Zhang and Michael Brady and Stephen Smith,20,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,1,45-57,Ieee,The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However. being a histogram-based model. the FM has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately. this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions. FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. Here. the authors propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model. which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations.

This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries. not observed in proton-proton collisions. which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot. dense medium.,True,LYLVqjcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1635,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,10374830077736851981,/scholar?cites=10374830077736851981,,,https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,0,0,0

1231270,Jet energy measurement and its systematic uncertainty in proton–proton collisions at√ s= 7TeV with the ATLAS detector,2015,Melissa Franklin and John Huth and L Jeanty and D Lopez Mateos and Kevin Mercurio and Masahiro Morii and William Spearman and Andy Yen and G Zevi Della Porta,,The European Physical Journal C,,,Springer Nature,The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton–proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s√=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb −1 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 . and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson. for  20≤pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |η|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton–proton interactions is corrected for. and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |η|<1.2 ) for jets with  55≤pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT . the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton–proton collisions and test-beam data. which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |η|=4.5 .

These models are frequently cast into Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with free parameters that can be constrained by measurements such as minimum bias distributions. These measurements contribute to the understanding of soft QCD; moreover. they are important in the determination of biases on high-pT phenomena due to underlying events (UEs) and event pileup effects and are therefore of growing importance for future Large Hadron Collider (LHC) physics.

1231323,Nanostructured sulfur cathodes,2013,Yuan Yang and Guangyuan Zheng and Yi Cui,42,,7,3018-3032,Royal Society of Chemistry,Rechargeable Li/S batteries have attracted significant attention lately due to their high specific energy and low cost. They are promising candidates for applications. including portable electronics. electric vehicles and grid-level energy storage. However. poor cycle life and low power capability are major technical obstacles. Various nanostructured sulfur cathodes have been developed to address these issues. as they provide greater resistance to pulverization. faster reaction kinetics and better trapping of soluble polysulfides. In this review. recent developments on nanostructured sulfur cathodes and mechanisms behind their operation are presented and discussed. Moreover. progress on novel characterization of sulfur cathodes is also summarized. as it has deepened the understanding of sulfur cathodes and will guide further rational design of sulfur electrodes.,True,lNmR2vAAAAAJ:JTqpx9DYBaYC,1543,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2013/cs/c2cs35256g,3368264528905960634,/scholar?cites=3368264528905960634,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed65/4118b041842ad4b7ce692ef4940dcfdb2bd2.pdf,0,0,0

For use in practical applications. a Si electrode must have high capacity. long cycle life. high efficiency. and the fabrication must be industrially scalable. Here. we design and fabricate a yolk-shell structure to meet all these needs. The fabrication is carried out without special equipment and mostly at room temperature. Commercially available Si nanoparticles are completely sealed inside conformal. thin. self-supporting carbon shells. with rationally designed void space in between the particles and the shell. The well-defined void space allows the Si particles to expand freely without breaking the outer carbon shell. therefore stabilizing the solid-electrolyte interphase on the shell surface.

1231335,Jet energy measurement and its systematic uncertainty in proton–proton collisions at√ s= 7TeV with the ATLAS detector,2015,Melissa Franklin and John Huth and L Jeanty and D Lopez Mateos and Kevin Mercurio and Masahiro Morii and William Spearman and Andy Yen and G Zevi Della Porta,,The European Physical Journal C,,,Springer Nature,The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton–proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s√=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb −1 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 . and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson. for  20≤pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |η|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton–proton interactions is corrected for. and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |η|<1.2 ) for jets with  55≤pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT . the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton–proton collisions and test-beam data. which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |η|=4.5 .

C-particles and fields,7,,EDP Sciences,The reconstruction of the signal from hadrons and jets emerging from the proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and entering the ATLAS calorimeters is based on a three-dimensional topological clustering of individual calorimeter cell signals. The cluster formation follows cell signal-significance patterns generated by electromagnetic and hadronic showers. In this. the clustering algorithm implicitly performs a topological noise suppression by removing cells with insignificant signals which are not in close proximity to cells with significant signals. The resulting topological cell clusters have shape and location information. which is exploited to apply a local energy calibration and corrections depending on the nature of the cluster. Topological cell clustering is established as a wellperforming calorimeter signal definition for jet and missing transverse momentum reconstruction in ATLAS.,True,bnEeYiMAAAAJ:iINcni2fUZgC,1601,https://boris.unibe.ch/114314/1/10.1140_epjc_s10052-017-5004-5.pdf,5923084678801175272,/scholar?cites=5923084678801175272,,,https://boris.unibe.ch/114314/1/10.1140_epjc_s10052-017-5004-5.pdf,0,0,0

Exfoliation takes place when the decomposition rate of the epoxy and hydroxyl sites of graphite oxide exceeds the diffusion rate of the evolved gases. thus yielding pressures that exceed the van der Waals forces holding the graphene sheets together. A comparison of the Arrhenius dependence of the reaction rate against the calculated diffusion coefficient based on Knudsen diffusion suggests a critical temperature of 550 °C which must be exceeded for exfoliation to occur. As a result of their wrinkled nature. the functionalized and defective graphene sheets do not collapse back to graphite oxide but are highly agglomerated.

We demonstrate that a novel air electrode consisting of an unusual hierarchical arrangement of functionalized graphene sheets (with no catalyst) delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 15000 mAh/g in lithium–O2 batteries which is the highest value ever reported in this field. This excellent performance is attributed to the unique bimodal porous structure of the electrode which consists of microporous channels facilitating rapid O2 diffusion while the highly connected nanoscale pores provide a high density of reactive sites for Li–O2 reactions.

This approach requires either costly high optical concentrations leading to heat loss by the hot bulk liquid and heated surfaces or vacuum.

The thermal conductivity of the nanofibres was found to be as high as∼ 104 W m− 1 K− 1. which is larger than the conductivities of about half of the pure metals.

1231406,Determination of jet energy calibration and transverse momentum resolution in CMS,2011,CMS collaboration,6,Journal of Instrumentation,11,P11002,IOP Publishing,Measurements of the jet energy calibration and transverse momentum resolution in CMS are presented. performed with a data sample collected in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV. corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36pb− 1. The transverse momentum balance in dijet and γ/Z+ jets events is used to measure the jet energy response in the CMS detector. as well as the transverse momentum resolution. The results are presented for three different methods to reconstruct jets: a calorimeter-based approach. the``Jet-Plus-Track''approach. which improves the measurement of calorimeter jets by exploiting the associated tracks. and the``Particle Flow''approach. which attempts to reconstruct individually each particle in the event. prior to the jet clustering. based on information from all relevant subdetectors.,True,KKwM9xgAAAAJ:wKETBy42zhYC,2317,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/6/11/P11002/meta,14679445396103586335,/scholar?cites=14679445396103586335,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/6/11/P11002/pdf,0,0,0

Here we show that a short peptide derived from rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) enables the transvascular delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to the brain. This 29-amino-acid peptide specifically binds to the acetylcholine receptor expressed by neuronal cells. To enable siRNA binding. a chimaeric peptide was synthesized by adding nonamer arginine residues at the carboxy terminus of RVG. This RVG-9R peptide was able to bind and transduce siRNA to neuronal cells in vitro. resulting in efficient gene silencing. After intravenous injection into mice. RVG-9R delivered siRNA to the neuronal cells. resulting in specific gene silencing within the brain.

Since they were first identified in the 1930s. more than 40 lipophilic tanshinones and structurally related compounds have been isolated from Danshen. In recent decades. numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the isolation. identification. synthesis and pharmacology of tanshinones. In addition to the well-studied cardiovascular activities. tanshinones have been investigated more recently for their anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. In this review. we update the herbal and alternative sources of tanshinones. and the pharmacokinetics of selected tanshinones. We discuss anti-cancer properties and identify critical issues for future research. Whereas previous studies have suggested anti-cancer potential of tanshinones affecting multiple cellular processes and molecular targets in cell culture models. data from in vivo potency assessment experiments in preclinical models vary greatly due to lack of uniformity of solvent vehicles and routes of administration. Chemical modifications and novel formulations had been made to address the poor oral bioavailability of tanshinones. So far. human clinical trials have been far from ideal in their design and execution for the purpose of supporting an anti-cancer indication of tanshinones.

1231487,Sequential minimal optimization: A fast algorithm for training support vector machines,1998,John Platt,,,,,,This paper proposes a new algorithm for training support vector machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization. or SMO. Training a support vector machine requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically. which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size. which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided.

1231491,Best practices for convolutional neural networks applied to visual document analysis,2003,Patrice Y Simard and Dave Steinkraus and John C Platt,,,,958,IEEE,Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents. However. there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple “do-it-yourself” implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods. such as momentum. weight decay. structuredependent learning rates. averaging layers. tangent prop. or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis.

Horst. PM Pardalos and NV Thoai March 2000 Preface to the First Edition Many recent advances in science. economics and engineering rely on nu merical techniques for computing globally optimal solutions to corresponding optimization problems. Global optimization problems are extraordinarily di verse and they include economic modeling. fixed charges. finance. networks and transportation. databases and chip design. image processing. nuclear and mechanical design. chemical engineering design and control. molecular biology. and environment al engineering. Due to the existence of multiple local optima that differ from the global solution all these problems cannot be solved by classical nonlinear programming techniques.

Single-stage systems,2012,V Tanaev and W Gordon and Yakov M Shafransky,284,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,"Scheduling theory is an important branch of operations research. Problems studied within the framework of that theory have numerous applications in various fields of human activity. As an independent discipline scheduling theory appeared in the middle of the fifties. and has attracted the attention of researchers in many countries. In the Soviet Union. research in this direction has been mainly related to production scheduling. especially to the development of automated systems for production control. In 1975 Nauka ("" Science"") Publishers. Moscow. issued two books providing systematic descriptions of scheduling theory. The first one was the Russian translation of the classical book Theory of Scheduling by American mathematicians RW Conway. WL Maxwell and LW Miller. The other one was the book Introduction to Scheduling Theory by Soviet mathematicians VS Tanaev and VV Shkurba. These books well complement each other. Both. books well represent major results known by that time. contain an exhaustive bibliography on the subject. Thus. the books. as well as the Russian translation of Computer and Job-Shop Scheduling Theory edited by EG Coffman. Jr..(Nauka. 1984) have contributed to the development of scheduling theory in the Soviet Union. Many different models. the large number of new results make it difficult for the researchers who work in related fields to follow the fast development of scheduling theory and to master new methods and approaches quickly.",True,4e_KEdUAAAAJ:wbdj-CoPYUoC,414,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ITDyCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:6wGwtX3lBvsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=OGPXeCciBY&sig=hSs8bCWoYg5KDJEirvuOH37RsVk,18088397281462059499,/scholar?cites=18088397281462059499,,,,0,0,0

The book shows how many equilibrium problems follow a general law (the so-called user equilibrium condition). Such law allows us to express the problem in terms of variational inequalities.

Pardalos,6,Journal of combinatorial optimization,3,299-333,Kluwer Academic Publishers,With the growth of the Internet. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) try to meet the increasing traffic demand with new technology and improved utilization of existing resources. Routing of data packets can affect network utilization. Packets are sent along network paths from source to destination following a protocol. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is the most commonly used intra-domain Internet routing protocol (IRP). Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths. splitting flow at nodes with several outgoing links on a shortest path to the destination IP address. Link weights are assigned by the network operator. A path length is the sum of the weights of the links in the path. The OSPF weight setting (OSPFWS) problem seeks a set of weights that optimizes network performance. We study the problem of optimizing OSPF weights. given a set of projected demands. with the objective of minimizing network congestion …,True,4e_KEdUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,405,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014852026591,10959269205851477895,/scholar?cites=10959269205851477895,,,http://suraj.lums.edu.pk/~te/mpls/a-genetic-algorithm-for.pdf,0,0,0

This second volume of the Handbook of Global Optimization is comprised of chapters dealing with modern approaches to global optimization. including different types of heuristics. Together (available as a set. set ISBN 1-4020-0742-6). the two volumes of the handbook cover a complete and broad spectrum of approaches for dealing with global optimization problems. The goal of the editors is to provide a true handbook that does not focus on particular applications of the heuristics and algorithms. but rather describes the state of the art for the different methodologies. Topics covered in the handbook include various metaheuristics. such as simulated annealing. genetic algorithms. neural networks. taboo search. shake-and-bake methods. and deformation methods. In addition. the book contains chapters on new exact stochastic and deterministic approaches to continuous and mixed-integer global optimization. such as stochastic adaptive search. two-phase methods. branch-and-bound methods with new relaxation and branching strategies. algorithms based on local optimization. and dynamical search. Finally. the book contains chapters on experimental analysis of algorithms and software. test problems. and applications.

Altogether. we analyze three ‘baseline’ scenarios of different socio-economic and technological developments that are assumed not to include any explicit climate policies. We then impose a range of climate stabilization targets on these baseline scenarios and analyze in detail the feasibility. costs and uncertainties of meeting a range of different climate stabilization targets in accordance with Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

This report explores these links in detail. and makes the connection between climate change mitigation and sustainable development. and demonstrates where the two are mutually reinforcing. Economic development needs. resource endowments and capacities-mitigative and adaptive-differ across regions. There is no one-size fits all approach of the climate change 15 problem and solutions needs to be regionally differentiated. reflecting primarily different socio-economic conditions and to a lesser extent geographical differences. Although this report has a global focus. an attempt is made to differentiate the assessment of scientific and technical findings for the various regions.20 Given that mitigation options vary significantly with economic sectors. it was decided to use the economic sectors to organise the material on short to medium term mitigation options. Contrary to what was done in the Third Assessment Report all relevant aspects of sectoral mitigation options. such as technology. cost. policies. etc are discussed together to provide the user with a comprehensive discussion of the mitigation options. 25,True,JobRFRAAAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC,498,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,15069716797967303289,/scholar?cites=15069716797967303289,,,https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/drafts/sod/AR4-WG3-SOD-TechnicalSummary.pdf,0,0,0

For example. the edge sites of MoS 2 are highly catalytically active and are thus preferred at the catalyst surface over MoS 2 basal planes. which are inert. However. thermodynamics favours the presence of the basal plane. limiting the number of active sites at the surface. Herein. we engineer the surface structure of MoS 2 to preferentially expose edge sites to effect improved catalysis by successfully synthesizing contiguous large-area thin films of a highly ordered double-gyroid MoS 2 bicontinuous network with nanoscaled pores. The high surface curvature of this catalyst mesostructure exposes a large fraction of edge sites. which. along with its high surface area. leads to excellent activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

This is the joint probability density function (pdf) of the three components of velocity and of the composition variables (species mass fractions and enthalpy). The principal method described is to solve a modelled transport equation for the velocity-composition joint pdf. For a variable-density flow with arbitrarily complex and nonlinear reactions. it is remarkable that in this equation the effects of convection. reaction. body forces and the mean pressure gradient appear exactly and so do not have to be modelled. Even though the joint pdf is a function of many independent variables. its transport equation can be solved by a Monte Carlo method for the inhomogeneous flows of practical interest.

In contrast to conventional reduced mechanisms no information is required concerning which reactions are to be assumed to be in partial equilibrium nor which species are assumed to be in steady state. The only “inputs” to the procedure are the detailed kinetics mechanism and the number of degrees of freedom required in the simplified scheme. (Four degrees of freedom corresponds to a four-step mechanism. etc.) The state properties given by the simplified scheme are automatically determined as functions of the coordinates associated with the degrees of freedom.

In this paper. we raise some fundamental questions concerning the conceptual foundations of LES and about the methodologies and protocols used in its application. The 10 questions addressed are stated at the end of the introduction. Several of these questions highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations on the artificial parameter Δ (ie the filter width or. more generally. the turbulence resolution length scale).

Instead of solving transport equations for all of the numerous species in a typical chemical mechanism and modeling the unclosed chemical source terms. the present study adopts an indirect mapping approach. whereby all of the detailed chemical processes are mapped to a reduced system of tracking scalars. Presently. only two such scalars are considered: a mixture fraction variable. which tracks the mixing of fuel and oxidizer. and a progress variable. which tracks the global extent-of-reaction of the local mixture. The mapping functions. which describe all of the detailed chemical processes with respect to the tracking variables. are determined by solving quasi-steady diffusion-reaction equations with complex chemical kinetics and multicomponent mass diffusion. The performance of the new model is compared to fast chemistry and steady flamelet models for predicting velocity. species concentration. and temperature fields in a methane-fueled coaxial jet combustor for which experimental data are available.

This methodology is based on the extension of the ‘filtered density function’(FDF) scheme recently proposed by Colucci et al.(1998) for LES of constant-density reacting flows. The FMDF represents the joint probability density function of the subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar quantities and is obtained by solution of its modelled transport equation.

In terms of the second‐order tensor that defines a stochastic Lagrangian model. corresponding models are obtained for the pressure‐rate‐of‐strain and the triple‐velocity correlations (that appear in the Reynolds‐stress equation). and for the pressure‐scrambling term in the scalar flux equation. There is an advantage in obtaining second‐moment closures via this route. because the resulting models automatically guarantee realizability. Some new stochastic Lagrangian models are presented that correspond (either exactly or approximately) to popular Reynolds‐stress models.,True,Ta87XqoAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,286,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.868329,7514018557638984166,/scholar?cites=7514018557638984166,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/07cc/2233b18eaa87f235adff94b8a3ad064768d1.pdf,0,0,0
1231612,Small scales. many species and the manifold challenges of turbulent combustion,2013,Stephen B Pope,34,,1,1-31,Elsevier,A major goal of combustion research is to develop accurate. tractable. predictive models for the phenomena occurring in combustion devices. which predominantly involve turbulent flows. With the focus on gas-phase. non-premixed flames. recent progress is reviewed. and the significant remaining challenges facing models of turbulent combustion are examined. The principal challenges are posed by the small scales. the many chemical species involved in hydrocarbon combustion. and the coupled processes of reaction and molecular diffusion in a turbulent flow field. These challenges. and how different modeling approaches face them. are examined from the viewpoint of low-dimensional manifolds in the high-dimensional space of chemical species. Most current approaches to modeling turbulent combustion can be categorized as flamelet-like or PDF-like.

The effects of wall distance on the local and global flame structure are investigated. Quenching distances and maximum wall heat fluxes during quenching are computed in laminar cases and are found to be comparable to experimental and analytical results. For turbulent cases. it is shown that quenching distances and maximum heat fluxes remain of the same order as for laminar flames. Based on simulation results. a “law-of-the-wall” model is derived to describe the interaction between a turbulent premixed flame and a wall. This model is constructed to provide reasonable behavior of flame surface density near a wall under the assumption that flame-wall interaction takes place at scales smaller than the computational mesh.

Because the design of LHTES systems involves a compromise between the amount of energy stored. the heat transfer rate. and the quality of the released thermal energy. an exergy analysis is also carried out to identify the preferred LHTES design. It is found that the LHTES with the lowest melting temperature PCM yields the highest exergy efficiency. However. a cascaded LHTES recovers the largest amount of exergy during a 24 h charging–discharging cycle.

Li‐S batteries have become attractive candidates for the next‐generation high‐energy rechargeable Li batteries because of their high theoretical energy density and cost effectiveness. Starting from a brief history of Li‐S batteries. this Review introduces the electrochemistry of Li‐S batteries. and discusses issues resulting from the electrochemistry. such as the electroactivity and the polysulfide dissolution. To address these critical issues. recent advances in Li‐S batteries are summarized. including the S cathode. Li anode. electrolyte. and new designs of Li‐S batteries with a metallic Li‐free anode.

Despite numerous efforts concerning this issue. combatting sulfur loss remains one of the greatest challenges. Here we show that this problem can be effectively diminished by controlling the sulfur as smaller allotropes. Metastable small sulfur molecules of S2–4 were synthesized in the confined space of a conductive microporous carbon matrix. The confined S2–4 as a new cathode material can totally avoid the unfavorable transition between the commonly used large S8 and S42–.

The interparticle space of the TiO2 electrodes is large enough to permit deep penetration of 65-Å InP QDs into the porous TiO2 film. The absorption of light increases linearly with the thickness of the TiO2 film indicating that the InP QDs are adsorbed homogeneously on the TiO2 surface. We found that large particles adsorb better than smaller ones probably due to less hindrance by the stabilizer. The solid films exhibit strong photoconductivity in the visible region indicating photosensitization of TiO2 by InP QDs. The photocurrent action spectrum of the TiO2/InP QD film at a potential of +1 V is consistent with the absorption spectrum of the InP QDs.

An InP precursor was formed from the reactants at room temperature; heating the precursor in a solution of trioctylphosphine oxide at 270 C for several days producedInP QDs with a mean diameter of 26.1±7.5 A (determined by counting lattice fringes in a TEM micrograph). From the known QD size distribution and its absorption spectrum. we used a theoretical model to calculate thedependence of InP QD bandgap on QD size.

InAs quantum dots of different sizes were synthesized and incorporated in solar cell devices. Efficient charge transfer from InAs quantum dots to TiO2 particles was achieved without deliberate modification of the quantum dot capping layer. A power conversion efficiency of about 1.7% under 5 mW/cm2 was achieved; this is relatively high for a nanocrystalline metal oxide solar cell sensitized with presynthesized quantum dots. but this efficiency could only be achieved at low light intensity.

Interfacial electron transfer processes are at the heart of catalysis. electrochemistry. and photoimaging. and have great potential for future applications in solar energy conversion and the photodegradation of environmentally hazardous chemicals. Surface Electron Transfer Processes is the first book to integrate approaches for electrochemistry. ultrasensitive laser spectroscopic studies of surfaces. and ultrahigh vacuum studies of model interfaces. The result is a detailed description of reaction mechanism. including a comprehensive treatment of interfacial electronic transitions. A wide range of surface types and structures are covered. Metals. semiconductors. nanostructures. and discrete states are treated in a unifying manner. Surface Electron Transfer Processes is organized like a tutorial. taking the reader through the basic theory required to understand the reaction dynamics. and proceeding with a comprehensive presentation of all aspects of the electronic and nuclear factors controlling surface reactions. Analysis of the assumptions and shortcomings of theoretical models leads naturally to discussion of experimental results. Subsequent chapters begin with introductory reviews of experimental studies and then bring the reader up-to-date on the most current methods for studying surface reactions and reaction mechanisms.

Solar energy is the largest source of non-carbonaceous energy and can be used to produce both electricity and fuel. However. the ratio of the areal cost to the conversion efficiency for devices converting solar photons to electricity or fuel must be reduced by at least 1 order of magnitude from the present values; this requires large increases in the cell efficiency and large reductions in the cost per unit area. We have shown how semiconductor quantum dots may greatly increase photon conversion efficiencies by producing multiple excitons from a single photon. This is possible because quantization of energy levels in quantum dots slows the cooling of hot excitons. promotes multiple exciton generation. and lowers the photon energy threshold for this process.

In this problem. lateness at customer locations is allowed although a penalty is incurred and added to the objective value. By adding large penalty values. the vehicle routing problem with hard time windows can be addressed as well. In the tabu search. a neighborhood of the current solution is created through an exchange procedure that swaps sequences of consecutive customers (or segments) between two routes. The tabu search also exploits an adaptive memory that contains the routes of the best previously visited solutions. New starting points for the tabu search are produced through a combination of routes taken from different solutions found in this memory.

An underlying strategic research challenge is to develop more generally applicable search methodologies. The term hyper-heuristic is relatively new; it was first used in 2000 to describe heuristics to choose heuristics in the context of combinatorial optimisation. However. the idea of automating the design of heuristics is not new; it can be traced back to the 1960s. The definition of hyper-heuristics has been recently extended to refer to a search method or learning mechanism for selecting or generating heuristics to solve computational search problems. Two main hyper-heuristic categories can be considered: heuristic selection and heuristic generation. The distinguishing feature of hyper-heuristics is that they operate on a …,True,CilK624AAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,968,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jors.2013.71,15673963244924225840,/scholar?cites=15673963244924225840,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jors.2013.71,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In this article. we propose a solution procedure for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). A relaxed version of this problem in which the path does not have to be elementary has been the backbone of a number of solution procedures based on column generation for several important problems. such as vehicle routing and crew pairing. In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However. for a number of other problems. the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the ESPPRC. which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem.

These are general solution procedures that explore the solution space to identify good solutions and often embed some of the standard route construction and improvement heuristics described in Chapter 5. In a major departure from classical approaches. metaheuristics allow deteriorating and even infeasible intermediary solutions in the course of the search process. The best known metaheuristics developed for the VRP typically identify better local optima than earlier heuristics. but they also tend to be more time consuming.We are aware of six main types of metaheuristic that have been applied to the VRP: Simulated Annealing (SA).

Elsiddig and Haberl H. et al.,,,,,Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. United Kingdom and New York. NY. USA,Agriculture. Forestry. and Other Land Use (AFOLU) plays a central role for food security and sustainable development. Plants take up carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and nitrogen (N) from the soil when they grow. re-distributing it among different pools. including above and below-ground living biomass. dead residues. and soil organic matter. The CO2 and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG). largely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). are in turn released to the atmosphere by plant respiration. by decomposition of dead plant biomass and soil organic matter. and by combustion. Anthropogenic land-use activities (e.g.. management of croplands. forests. grasslands. wetlands). and changes in land use / cover (e.g.. conversion of forest lands and grasslands to cropland and pasture. afforestation) cause changes superimposed on these natural fluxes. AFOLU activities lead to both sources of CO2 (e.g.. deforestation. peatland drainage) and sinks of CO2 (e.g.. afforestation. management for soil carbon sequestration). and to non-CO2 emissions primarily from agriculture (e.g.. CH4 from livestock and rice cultivation. N2O from manure storage and agricultural soils and biomass burning.   The main mitigation options within AFOLU involve one or more of three strategies: reduction / prevention of emissions to the atmosphere by conserving existing carbon pools in soils or vegetation that would otherwise be lost or by reducing emissions of CH4 and N2O; sequestration - enhancing the uptake of carbon in terrestrial reservoirs. and thereby removing CO2 from the atmosphere; and reducing CO2 emissions by substitution of biological …,True,Lr7JucQAAAAJ:oPLKW5k6eA4C,1253,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11115/,14104224860290958839,/scholar?cites=14104224860290958839,,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/11115/,0,0,0

A technology review. including promising future components. was made. resulting in a set of promising conversion concepts. Flowsheeting models were made to analyse the technical performance. Results were used for economic evaluations. Overall energy efficiencies are around 55% HHV for methanol and around 60% for hydrogen production. Accounting for the lower energy quality of fuel compared to electricity. once-through concepts perform better than the concepts aimed for fuel only production.

This is certainly evident in Europe. where a kaleidoscope of activities and programs was and is executed for developing and stimulating bio-energy.Over the past 10–15 years in the European Union. heat and electricity production from biomass increased with some 2% and 9% per year. respectively. between 1990 and 2000 and biofuel production increased about eight-fold in the same period. Biomass contributed some two-thirds of the total renewable energy production in the European Union (EU) (2000 PJ) or 4% of the total energy supply in 1999. Given the targets for heat. power and biofuels. this contribution may rise to some 10% (6000 PJ) in 2010.Over time. the scale at which bio-energy is being used has increased considerably.

However. the physical and chemical structure of lignocellulosic materials forms strong native recalcitrance and results in relatively low yield of ethanol from raw lignocellulosic materials. An appropriate pretreatment method is required to overcome this recalcitrance. For decades various pretreatment processes have been developed to improve the digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass.

Traditionally. it has been attempted to reveal the complicated and heterogeneous structure of lignin by a series of chemical analyses. such as thioacidolysis (TA). nitrobenzene oxidation (NBO). and derivatization followed by reductive cleavage (DFRC). Recent advances in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology undoubtedly have made solution-state NMR become the most widely used technique in structural characterization of lignin due to its versatility in illustrating structural features and structural transformations of lignin polymers. As one of the most promising diagnostic tools. NMR provides unambiguous evidence for specific structures as well as quantitative structural information.

The untreated and pretreated solid residues were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). solid-state cross polarization/magic angle spinning (CP/MAS). 13C NMR spectroscopy. and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). as well as chemical methods. The results showed that HCW pretreatment solubilized mainly hemicelluloses and resulted in enriched cellulose and lignin content in the pretreated solids. It was found that the deposition of lignin droplets on the residual surfaces was produced during pretreatment under the hot water conditions above 140 C.

The experiments have shown that while the rate of borehole pressurization has a marked effect on breakdown pressures. the pressure at which hydraulic fractures initiate (and thus tensile strength) is independent of the rate of borehole pressurization when the effect of fluid penetration is negligible. Thus. the experiments indicate that use of breakdown pressures rather than fracture initiation pressures may lead to an erroneous estimate of tectonic stresses.

The BET analysis is the standard method for determining surface areas from nitrogen adsorption isotherms and was originally derived for multilayer gas adsorption onto flat surfaces. Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs) are a relatively new class of crystalline. porous materials that have been shown to exhibit very large BET surface areas. These materials are microporous and possess surfaces that are far from flat. In some MOFs. adsorption occurs through a pore-filling mechanism rather than by layer formation.

The scenarios both provide inputs to climate models and also assist in assessing the relative importance of relevant trace gases and aerosol precursors in changing atmospheric composition and hence climate. Scenarios can also help lo improve the understanding of key relationships among factors that drive future emissions.Scenarios are not predictions of the future and should not be used as such. This becomes increasingly true as the time horizon increases. because the basis for the underlying assumptions becomes increasingly speculative.

The EMF 22 International Scenarios engaged ten of the world's leading integrated assessment (IA) models to focus on the combined implications of three factors integral to international climate negotiations: (1) the long-term climate-related target. expressed in this study in terms of the CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) concentration associated with the GHGs regulated under the Kyoto Protocol. (2) whether or not this target can be temporarily exceeded prior to 2100 (“overshoot”) allowing for greater near-term flexibility. and (3) the nature of international participation in emissions mitigation.

Long-standing tensions between industrialized and developing countries have raised the issue of equity in burden-sharing. Moreover. individual industrialized nations have pleaded special circumstances and have sought differentiation in their obligations.

The two main axes of the matrix are: 1) the level of radiative forcing of the climate system (as characterised by the representative concentration pathways) and 2) a set of alternative plausible trajectories of future global development (described as shared socio-economic pathways).

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

Many of the chapters in these successful volumes were widely cited and appeared on graduate reading lists. and some continue to appear even recently. Since the first volumes published. the field of industrial organization has continued to evolve.

The aim is to serve as a source. reference and teaching supplement for industrial organization. or industrial economics. the microeconomics field that focuses on business behavior and its implications for both market structures and processes. and for related public policies. The first two volumes of the HIO appeared at roughly the same time as Jean Tirole's book The Theory of Industrial Organization. Together they helped revolutionize the teaching of industrial organization. and provided a state-of-the-art summary.

1231879,The industrial organization of markets with two-sided platforms,2005,David S Evans and Richard Schmalensee,,,w11603,,National Bureau of Economic Research,Two-sided platforms (2SPs) cater to two or more distinct groups of customers. facilitating value-creating interactions between them. The village market and the village matchmaker were 2SPs; eBay and Match. com are more recent examples. Other examples include payment card systems. magazines. shopping malls. and personal computer operating systems. Building on the seminal work of Rochet and Tirole (2003). a rapidly growing literature has illuminated the economic principles that apply to 2SPs generally. One key result is that 2SPs may find it profit-maximizing to charge prices for one customer group that are below marginal cost or even negative. and such skewed pricing pattern is prevalent. although not universal. in industries that appear to be based on 2SPs. Over the years. courts have also recognized that certain industries. notably payment card systems and newspapers. now understood to be based on 2SPs. are governed by unusual economic relationships.

Implications of Gaussian demand are explored. Pure bundling is shown to operate by reducing buyer diversity. thus facilitating the capture of consumers' surplus. It generally makes buyers worse off than unbundled sales; it is more profitable if average reservation prices are high enough. Mixed bundling combines advantages of both pure bundling and unbundled sales. and it is generally strictly more profitable than either.

They power everything from mobile phones and automobile navigation systems to search engines and web portals. They have been the source of enormous value to consumers and helped some entrepreneurs build great fortunes. And they are likely to drive change that will dwarf the business and technology revolution we have seen to this point. Invisible Engines examines the business dynamics and strategies used by firms that recognize the transformative power unleashed by this new revolution—a revolution that will change both new and old industries.The authors argue that in order to understand the successes of software platforms. we must first understand their role as a technological meeting ground where application developers and end users converge. Apple. Microsoft. and Google. for example. charge developers little or nothing for using their platforms and make most of their money from end users; Sony PlayStation and other game consoles. by contrast. subsidize users and make more money from developers. who pay royalties for access to the code they need to write games.

Many of the most dynamic public companies. from Alibaba to Facebook to Visa. and the most valuable start-ups. such as Airbnb and Uber. are matchmakers that connect one group of customers with another group of customers. Economists call matchmakers multisided platforms because they provide physical or virtual platforms for multiple groups to get together. Dating sites connect people with potential matches. for example. and ride-sharing apps do the same for drivers and riders. Although matchmakers have been around for millennia. they’re becoming more and more popular—and profitable—due to dramatic advances in technology. and a lot of companies that have managed to crack the code of this business model have become today’s power brokers.

The coalition of states that produced and burned high‐sulfur coal both failed to block acid rain legislation in 1990 and received fewer allowances than in plausible benchmark allocations.

In chemical terms. intercalation has been associated with the insertion of guest species between the layers of a crys talline host lattice and is a special case of a topochemical reaction. Just as in the calendar usage. the process of intercalation should be reversible through appropriate chemical or thermal treatment. The alkali metal compounds of the best known host. graphite. have been known since 1926 (1). The formation of intercalation compounds with the layered dichalcogenides as hosts was first reported by Rudorff and Sick (2. 3) in 1959 for the alkali metals.

Treatment of ZSM-5 in NaOH solutions leads to mesoporosity development. stemming from the preferential extraction of Si from the zeolite framework. Investigation of the influence of temperature and time during this treatment on the porous properties of the final material shows that the mesopore size and volume can be tuned to a certain extent by optimization of these two variables. Optimal treatment conditions lead to a spectacularly increased mesopore surface area (450%) from 40 m2/g for the calcined zeolite to 225 m2/g for the alkaline-treated material. while the micropore volume is only slightly decreased.

Similarities between the treatment mediated by organic hydroxides and the conventional NaOH leaching comprised (i) the requirement to work with a starting zeolite in the optimal Si/Al window of 25–50 and (ii) the minor influence of the counter-cation (H+.

In this paper we review the main contributions to this field reported in the literature. dividing Janus nanoparticles into three main categories. depending on the route followed for their preparation. The first group of Janus nanoparticles is those obtained via self-assembly. of. e.g.. block copolymers. and mixtures of ligands that in some cases show competitive adsorption on the surfaces of the nanoparticles. The second group comprises Janus nanoparticles obtained through a masking step. in which particles are trapped at the interface between two phases. so that a modification to the particle surface is made only on one side.

Haber discovered how ammonia. a chemically reactive. highly usable form of nitrogen. could be synthesized by reacting atmospheric dinitrogen with hydrogen in the presence of iron at high pressures and temperatures. Today. this reaction is known as the Haber–Bosch process: Fritz Haber was the inventor who created the breakthrough and laid the foundations for highpressure chemical engineering. but it was Carl Bosch who subsequently developed it on an industrial scale. for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1931.

Emissions are estimated for all major anthropogenic sources. excluding biomass burning. We estimate total Asian anthropogenic emissions in the year 2006 as follows: 47.1 Tg SO2. 36.7 Tg NOx. 298.2 Tg CO. 54.6 Tg NMVOC. 29.2 Tg PM10. 22.2 Tg PM2.5. 2.97 Tg BC. and 6.57 Tg OC. We emphasize emissions from China because they dominate the Asia pollutant outflow to the Pacific and the increase of emissions from China since 2000 is of great concern. We have implemented a series of improved methodologies to gain a better understanding of emissions from China. including a detailed technology-based approach. a dynamic methodology representing rapid technology renewal. critical examination of energy statistics. and a new scheme of NMVOC speciation for model-ready emissions.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound. for each region and sector. is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate. ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone. carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However. stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend.

The recently developed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) create a framework for the study of climate-related scenario outcomes. Their five narratives span a wide range of worlds that vary in their challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here we provide background on the quantification that has been selected to serve as the reference. or ‘marker’. implementation for SSP2. The SSP2 narrative describes a middle-of-the-road development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space. We explain how the narrative has been translated into quantitative assumptions in the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework. We show that our SSP2 marker implementation occupies a central position for key metrics along the mitigation and …,True,letMf0MAAAAJ:4hFrxpcac9AC,354,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300784,10284635573911687524,/scholar?cites=10284635573911687524,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016300784,0,0,0

Research has focused on the health impacts of indoor exposure to fine particulate pollution. Here. for the 2010 Global Burden of Disease project (GBD 2010). we evaluated the impact of household cooking with solid fuels on regional population-weighted ambient PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm) pollution (APM2.5).Objectives: We estimated the proportion and concentrations of APM2.5 attributable to household cooking with solid fuels (PM2.5-cook) for the years 1990. 2005. and 2010 in 170 countries. and associated ill health.Methods: We used an energy supply–driven emissions model (GAINS; Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) and source-receptor model (TM5-FASST) to estimate the proportion of APM2.5 produced by households and the proportion of household PM2.5 emissions from cooking with solid fuels.

1232023,Black carbon in the Arctic: the underestimated role of gas flaring and residential combustion emissions,2013,Andreas Stohl and Z Klimont and Sabine Eckhardt and K Kupiainen and Vladimir P Shevchenko and VM Kopeikin and AN Novigatsky,13,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,17,8833-8855,Copernicus GmbH," Arctic haze is a seasonal phenomenon with high concentrations of accumulation-mode aerosols occurring in the Arctic in winter and early spring. Chemistry transport models and climate chemistry models struggle to reproduce this phenomenon. and this has recently prompted changes in aerosol removal schemes to remedy the modeling problems. In this paper. we show that shortcomings in current emission data sets are at least as important. We perform a 3 yr model simulation of black carbon (BC) with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART. The model is driven with a new emission data set (""ECLIPSE emissions"") which includes emissions from gas flaring. While gas flaring is estimated to contribute less than 3% of global BC emissions in this data set. flaring dominates the estimated BC emissions in the Arctic (north of 66° N). Putting these emissions into our model. we find that flaring contributes 42% to the annual mean BC surface concentrations in the Arctic. In March. flaring even accounts for 52% of all Arctic BC near the surface. Most of the flaring BC remains close to the surface in the Arctic. so that the flaring contribution to BC in the middle and upper troposphere is small. Another important factor determining simulated BC concentrations is the seasonal variation of BC emissions from residential combustion (often also called domestic combustion. which is used synonymously in this paper). We have calculated daily residential combustion emissions using the heating degree day (HDD) concept based on ambient air temperature and compare results from model simulations using emissions with daily. monthly and annual time …",True,letMf0MAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C,340,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/8833/2013/,10714016177673917125,/scholar?cites=10714016177673917125,,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/8833/2013/acp-13-8833-2013.pdf,0,0,0
