These sensors employ a reactive peptide sequence within a tether linking a quencher to a biotin. The peptide binds to sensors containing colocated biotin-binding protein and fluorescent polymer by means of biotin–biotin binding protein interactions. resulting in a strong quenching of polymer fluorescence. Enzyme-mediated cleavage of the peptide results in a reversal of the fluorescence quenching. These assays for protease activity are simple. sensitive. fast. and have the specificity required for screening chemical libraries for novel protease inhibitors in a high-throughput screening assay environment.

On the other hand. a ferrimagnet can be considered. in a simplified picture. as an antiferromagnet in which the magnetic sublattices do not compensate each other. Then. the synthesis of molecular ferrimagnets provides a convenient strategy to overcome the difficulties related with parallel alignment of the moments found preparing ferromagnets. 3 456* Efforts to prepare new bimetallic ferrimagnets must rely either upon heterometallic substances or else upon homometallic …,True,pnQ-hpYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,34,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic00082a021,7277135317884516326,/scholar?cites=7277135317884516326,,,0,0,0

Structural. magnetic. and spectroscopic analyses indicate that this compound undergoes thermal switching between an S=0 and an S=2 state. which is very rare in four-coordinate complexes. The transition to the high-spin state is accompanied by an increase in Fe–N bond lengths and a concomitant contraction of intraligand N–N bonds.

Subsequent chemical oxidation by XeF2 demonstrates that the trapped (formazanate)B fragment retains carbenoid character and regenerates the boron difluoride starting material in good yield. These results indicate that the formazanate ligand framework provides a unique entry into sub-valent boron chemistry.,True,RK8ARXYAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,41,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b01287,6374650981187830592,/scholar?cites=6374650981187830592,,,0,0,0

The isolation of a catalytically competent Ru–dieneamido complex from the reaction between the Ru catalyst and pentenenitrile in combination with DFT calculations supports a mechanism in which activation of the nitrile through metal–ligand cooperativity is a key step. The nitrile‐derived Ru‐N moiety is sufficiently Brønsted basic to activate the alcohol and initiate conjugate addition of the alkoxide to the α.β‐unsaturated fragment.

The absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs from the gastrointestinal tract is often enhanced by interaction with the pathways of fat digestion and absorption. These processes can enhance drug absorption. Thus. the phase behavior of bile components and digested lipids is of great interest to pharmaceutical scientists who seek to optimize drug solubilization in the gut lumen. This can be achieved by dosing drugs after food or preferably by formulating the drug in a lipid-based delivery system.

The generation of a C–O bond at the expense of a C–H bond during this process may be considered the most basic form of C–H functionalization.

This molecular recognition and macroscopic response shows high selectivity to the guest structure. and tolerates only a small amount of conformational mobility in the THY guest. On the other hand. addition of a small DAP‐containing guest does not break the aggregates. but instead. results in new micelles which show a different selectivity profile from the parent morphology.

The MSB and ML samples were extracted in 95% ethanol and the extracts assayed for the inhibition of pancreatic lipase (PL) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) as well as for the inhibition of lipolysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We have also examined the anti-obesity action of MSB and ML by testing whether the extracts prevented weight gain induced by feeding a high-fat diet to male Wistar rats for 12 weeks. Both MSB and ML inhibited PL and LPL. suggesting that they may affect both fat absorption and the uptake of fatty acids. if enough of the active components can be absorbed and entered into the circulation. The inhibition of stimulated lipolysis by MSB and ML suggested that the cells took up the active components of the extracts. In addition. MSB and ML increased fecal fat excretion and reduced serum glucose and insulin levels and down-regulated some obesity-related genes (LPL. hormone-sensitive lipase. fatty acid synthase. resistin) in liver and epididymal fat. The precise molecular mechanisms by which MSB and ML inhibit lipases and lipolysis still requires further investigation. However. the relative biochemical complexity of these extracts may produce a pleiotropic action on several lipid and carbohydrate metabolism targets simultaneously. making MSB and ML multifunctional botanical therapeutics useful in weight control.

Abundant data exist to suggest that betaine has a potential for prevention of chronic diseases and that its dietary intake may contribute to overall health enhancement. Several studies have pointed out that the betaine status of the general population is inadequate and have suggested nutritional strategies to improve dietary intake of betaine. Cereal-based food has been implicated as the major source of betaine in the Western diet. This review summarizes the results on the betaine content in various cereals and related products. Attention has been given to the betaine content in gluten-free grains and products.

This new composite object has a remarkable sensitivity. ranging from 0.3% to 4% of water in organic solvents. The sensing capacity is related to the structural transformation due to the loss of water molecules that CP1 undergoes with temperature or by solvent molecules' competition. which induces significant change in color simultaneously. The CP1 and 3D printed materials are stable in air over 1 year and also at biological pHs (5–7). therefore suggesting potential applications as robust colorimetric sensors.

Considering that there are only three major biopolymer backbones (proteins. ribonucleic acids. and polysaccharides). nature vividly teaches that copolymer sequence is a powerful way to meet diverse chemical challenges.

Systematic studies on alternative monomers closely related to those found in nature have provided clues about the fitness of R-amino acids. ribofuranosyl (5′ f3′) nucleic acids. and phosphodiester linkages.

The oligomer is soluble in a variety of solvents of intermediate polarity. with the majority of these solvents being helicogenic. The amphiphilic nature of the chain allows the solvophobic backbone to be solubilized in a wide range of solvents through the polar triethylene glycol side chains. As demonstrated through UV and CD spectroscopic experiments. the helical conformation is increasingly stabilized with increasing solvent polarity in the absence of specific solvent–chain interactions. Surprisingly. very few solvents are capable of fully denaturing the helix. indicating the strength of the solvophobic driving forces in this cooperative system.

An analogous fractionation should occur during amino acid biosynthesis. Whereas these effects are traditionally measured using gas-phase isotope ratio on 1H-1H and 1H-2H. using an electrospray mass spectrometry-based technique on the original biomolecular structure and fitting of isotopic patterns we measured the hydrogen isotope compositions of proteins from an acidophilic microbial community with organism specificity and compared values with those for lipids.

The central premise of this method is that. given M phenotypic classes. mutations that do not affect the phenotype should partition among the M classes according to a multinomial distribution. Deviations from this distribution are indicative of a link between specific mutations and phenotypes. We suggest that this method will aid the engineering of functional nucleic acids. proteins. and other biomolecules by uncovering target sites for rational mutagenesis.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,DNA ligases (EC.6.5.1.1) are key enzymes that catalyze the formation of phosphodiester bonds at single stranded or double stranded breaks between adjacent 5′ phosphoryl and 3′ hydroxyl groups of DNA. These enzymes are important for survival because they are involved in major cellular processes like DNA replication/repair and recombination. DNA ligases can be classified into two groups on the basis of their cofactor specificities. NAD+‐dependent DNA ligases are present in bacteria. some entomopox viruses and mimi virus while ATP‐dependent DNA ligases are ubiquitous. The former have recently been drawing a lot of attention as novel targets for antibiotics to overcome current drug resistance issues. Currently a diverse range of inhibitors have been identified.

In this work it is shown that those writing tools are readily adapted to produce a “low tech”. renewable and minimal cost electrode which. when employed for anodic stripping voltammetry under mercury plated thin-film conditions. performs equally well as commercially available “high tech” carbon electrodes. In the absence of the mercury film. small background currents arising from clays and polymers present in pencil graphite are detected and some “thin layer” responses resulting from solution creepage between the graphite and the PTFE holder are observed.

Convolutions are derived which permit interconversion between the current and the surface concentrations.

The virtue of this approach is that the modelling. be it algebraic. simulative or numerical. takes place in one dimension only—that of time—rather than in the dual dimensions of space and time. However. the applicability of pure semiintegration is limited to experiments in which transport is by planar semiinfinite diffusion. preceded by a state in which no current flows. and without concurrent homogeneous reactions.

Using a combination of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. including Synchrotron-sourced Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR). x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). we have identified the chemical components that constitute the nanoscale structures on the surface of the wings of the dragonfly.

The major components were identified to be fatty acids. predominantly hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid. and n-alkanes with even numbered carbon chains ranging from C14 to C30. The data obtained from XPS depth profiling. in conjunction with that obtained from GCMS analyses. enabled the location of particular classes of compounds to different regions within the epicuticle. Hexadecanoic acid was found to be a major component of the outer region of the epicuticle. which forms the surface nanostructures. and was also detected in deeper layers along with octadecanoic acid.

Among microbial sources of new enzymes. the rationale for screening fungal endophytes as a potential source of such enzymes relates to the hypothesised mutualistic relationship between the endophyte and its host plant. There is a need for new microbial amylases that are active at low temperature and alkaline conditions as these would find industrial applications as detergents. An α-amylase produced by Preussia minima. isolated from the Australian native plant. Eremophilia longifolia. was purified to homogeneity through fractional acetone precipitation and Sephadex G-200 gel filtration. followed by DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography.

In order to cope with environmental stresses. their surfaces have developed cuticular layers that consist of highly sophisticated structures. These structures serve a number of purposes. and impart useful properties to these surfaces. These two groups of organisms are the only ones identified thus far that possess truly superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties. These properties result from their micro-and nano-scale structures. comprised of three-dimensional wax formations. This review analyzes the surface topologies and surface chemistry of insects and plants in order to identify the features common to both organisms. with particular reference to their superhydrophobic and self-cleaning properties.

A number of electron-donating (ED) and electron-withdrawing (EW) units based on Dewar's rules are substituted into the π-conjugated oligo-phenylenevinylene bridge of the reference TA-St-CA dye. The effects of these alternations on the molecular structures and the electron absorption spectra are calculated using time-dependant density functional theory (TDDFT). It is found that chemical modifications using electron donating (ED) substitutions exhibit advantages over the electron withdrawing (EW) substitutes to reduce the HOMO–LUMO energy gap as well as the electron distribution of the frontier orbitals of the new dyes. Dewar's rule is a useful guideline for rational design of new dye sensitizers with desired HOMO–LUMO gap.

An electrochemically active surface area determined by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was studied as a function of ion exchange capacity. Maximum activity is related to the concentration of sulfonate groups within the catalyst layer.

Modified membranes produced by polymerization of the pyrrole with hydrogen peroxide and iron (III) have been evaluated in a DMFC. Both methods produce membranes that can provide enhanced cell performance. although membranes produced with iron (III) as the oxidizing agent for the polymerization require additional treatments to restore their conductivity and promote bonding to the electrodes. Performance gains result from substantial reductions of the cathode overpotential. while anode overpotentials increase due to the lower conductivities of the modified membranes.

Danthron) have been recorded in the UV-VIS and IR regions using uniaxially stretched polyethylene as an anisotropic solvent. The LD results show that only three different transition moment directions are present in the observed ≈ 30 transitions. This indicates that the molecular symmetry of the compound in stretched polyethylene is C2v (in contrast to Cs in the stable crystal form) and allows an unambiguous symmetry classification of the observed electronic and vibrational states. The results lead to reassignment of at least three vibrational modes. including the asymmetric δ(OH) and δ(CO) in-plane bending modes that are of interest in the discussion of intramolecular hydrogen bonding effects.,True,4AC9NPgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030101049287050J,16484543106328940417,/scholar?cites=16484543106328940417,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44754025/Ultraviolet-visible_and_infrared_linear_20160415-28465-gfz32u.pdf,0,0,0

Optical spectroscopic methods have been employed to examine the interaction between double-stranded calf thymus DNA and ellagic acid in low-ionic-strength aqueous solutions at pH values of 5.5. 7.0. and 8.8. Based on normal absorption titration and flow linear dichroism experiments. it is confirmed that the neutral form of ellagic acid present at pH 5.5 binds to double-stranded DNA. It is found that the plane of the ellagic acid chromophore is positioned at an angle relative to the DNA helix axis. which is in accordance with intercalation of ellagic acid in DNA. It is concluded that at higher values of pH no or a very limited amount of ellagic acid binds to DNA.

Limits for O–H··· Y systems are taken as 2800> ν OH> 1800 cm− 1. and 19 ppm> δ O H> 15 ppm. Recent results as well as an account of theoretical advances are presented for a series of important classes of compounds such as β-diketone enols. β-thioxoketone enols. Mannich bases. proton sponges. quinoline N-oxides and diacid anions. The O··· O distance has long been used as a parameter for hydrogen bond strength in O–H··· O systems. On a broad scale. a correlation between OH stretching wavenumbers and O··· O distances is observed. as demonstrated experimentally as well as theoretically. but for substituted β-diketone enols this correlation is relatively weak.

By analyzing a 1992 national level household sample survey data collected from the female recipients of collateral-free loans of three relatively large rural development agencies in Bangladesh—the present study shows that the participation in income-generating projects by poor rural women has led to an increased level of contraceptive use and to a decreased level of desire for additional children. These effects are much higher than those of the corresponding levels for Bangladesh as a whole. indicating both the additional effect of income-generating projects as well as the effects of their population education components. Implications of these findings for inducing further increase in contraceptive use in Bangladesh are discussed in the paper.,True,I2Us_g4AAAAJ:SIv7DqKytYAC,92,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0305750X94901112,17958748472002391152,/scholar?cites=17958748472002391152,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48796119/0305-750x_2894_2990111-220160913-17203-1scxqcn.pdf,0,0,0

The identification of possible catalysts for this reaction was initiated by the screening of simple binary and ternary admixtures of Pd/charcoal in combination with one or two metal and/or metalloid components as the catalyst. This approach permitted rapid evaluation of over 400 admixture combinations for the oxidative methyl esterification of 1-octanol at 60 °C in methanol.

Low levels of literacy in women and deeply held cultural beliefs and practices have been found to contribute to the ineffectiveness of routine counselling delivered universally by community health workers in Pakistan.

Ltd.,There are more than one billion Muslims in the world and fasting for Ramadan is an obligatory ritual for all adult Muslims. The majority of Muslims observe absolute fasting (no food or water) between dawn and sunset in the holy month of Ramadan. For people with diabetes who take part in such a fast there are potential benefits and possible risks of hypo‐ and hyperglycaemia. It is therefore important that medical professionals ensure patients and their relatives (if appropriate) have the knowledge and support to undertake fasting safely. This is as important in India. Pakistan and the Sudan. as it is in the UK. The Netherlands and the USA. This article summarises briefly the religious context of Ramadan together with its potential metabolic impact.

We describe both hole‐ and electron‐mediated ferromagnetism. For hole‐mediated ferromagnetism. we show that there are two distinct mechanisms related to the stabilization of ferromagnetism. The difference between them is related to the position of the impurity d levels with respect to the valence band edge. If the impurity states are in the band gap. ferromagnetism can be explained by double exchange. which is related to the direct coupling between the impurity levels. whereas if the filled impurity states are below the VBM. ferromagnetism can be explained by the Zener model. which is related to the coupling between the impurity d levels and the host valence p states.

For GaN. we suggest that this can be achieved by adding 3 d acceptors such as Zn. Mn. or Cu because the p− d repulsion between the 3 d impurity levels and the valence band maximum is larger in the ZB phase than in the WZ phase. This makes the top of the valence states of the ZB structure higher than that of the WZ structure. As holes are created at the top of the valence states by the impurities. it will cost less energy for the holes to be created in the ZB structure. thus stabilizing this phase.

Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Research Foundation,The contamination of soil and wastewaters with Cr (VI) is a major problem. It has been suggested that microbial methods for Cr (VI) reduction are better than chemical methods. as they do not add other ions or toxic chemicals to the environment. In this study an aerobic reduction of Cr (VI) to Cr (III) by employing mixed Pseudomonas cultures isolated from a marshy land has been reported. The role of chromium concentration. temperature. pH and additives on the microbial reduction of Cr (VI) has been investigated. NADH was found to enhance the rate of reduction of Cr (VI). Complete reduction of chromium (VI) has been possible even at chromium (VI) concentrations of 300 ppm. Ions like SO4 2 and poly-phenols inhibited the metabolic activity relating to Cr (VI) reduction. Under optimal conditions 100mg/L of Cr (VI) was completely reduced within 180 min.,True,hJTbyvoAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,34,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jgam/53/2/53_2_71/_article/-char/ja/,14102546248157680816,/scholar?cites=14102546248157680816,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jgam/53/2/53_2_71/_pdf,0,0,0

Unlike the isostructural Cu(II)- or Mo(II)-based MOPs. Cr(II)-based MOPs show unusually high gas uptakes and surface areas.

They are distinguished from normal 2D insulators with their nontrivial band-structure topology identified by the Z 2 number as protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Two-dimensional TIs have intriguing spin-velocity locked conducting edge states and insulating properties in the bulk. In the edge states. the electrons with opposite spins propagate in opposite directions and the backscattering is fully prohibited when the TRS is conserved. This leads to a quantized dissipationless “two-lane highway” for charge and spin transportation and promises potential applications.

The remarkable features emerging from this study is that the zinc layers behave as a momentum filter (near the Fermi energy the Bloch states having the same orbital character as the molecular states conduct well) when they are inserted within metallic CNT electrodes thereby providing 1D heterojunctions …,True,0Qr9iZwAAAAJ:SPgmg5JLkoEC,21,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn7004377,434428068389623488,/scholar?cites=434428068389623488,,,0,0,0

Khazaei. A.A. Farajian. Y. Kawazoe. Phys. Rev.

The results show that the current emission from the cap with one adsorbed Cs is 3.4 times larger than the cap without any Cs. It is 9.6 times larger in the cap with two adsorbed Cs atoms. After Cs deposition the emission patterns become asymmetric (current emission from the carbon atoms located at the topmost pentagon ring close to Cs atoms is larger than the other atomic sites). There are very few localized states on Cs atoms. Hence. although the tunneling probability of electron emission from Cs atoms is significant. there is no current from Cs atoms.

For example. the development of transition-metal mediated transformations and asymmetric catalysis have expanded the range of molecules that can now be accessed. By way of contrast. the technology and many of the tools used to perform synthetic operations have remained more or less constant. Although batch-mode working is the most common manner of conducting reactions and subsequent downstream manipulations. there are many advantages in augmenting this with modern enabling technologies. Indeed. all components of a chemical process. such as reagent delivery. mixing. heating. analytical monitoring. quenching. work-up and finally purification can affect the overall success of the reaction and consequently all could benefit from improvement. Recently. machine-assisted protocols have been influencing the way that molecules are being prepared.[2] In particular our group and others are addressing some of the recurring challenges that face organic synthesis by providing simpler and more efficient processing tools. In order to achieve this. we have been evaluating the utility of flow-based chemical synthesis. Under a dynamic flow regime mixing and heat transfer can be controlled more accurately [3] and the use of solid-phase reagents and catalysts can facilitate the purification as an in-line integrated process.[4] The importance of monitoring devices for learning and understanding these processes cannot be underestimated.

The H content decreased. and the C/N ratio varied between 0.59 and 0.70 with preparation temperatures between 550 and 650 °C due to increased layer condensation. The UV–vis spectra exhibited a strong π–π* transition near 400 nm with a semiconductor-like band edge extending into the visible range. Samples synthesized at 600–650 °C showed an additional absorption near 500 nm that is assigned to n−π* electronic transitions involving the N lone pairs.

1135468,Chemistry of the lanthanides using pyrazolylborate ligands,2002,Noémia Marques and Andrea Sella and Josef Takats,102,,6,2137-2160,American Chemical Society,As a result of the large size of the lanthanide ions and the predominant ionic bonding. steric saturation is a critical factor in controlling the coordination number. the geometry. and the architecture of their complexes. The isolation of well-defined molecular species often requires the use of sterically demanding ligands. The pyrazolylborate ligands. first introduced by Trofimenko. 1 represent an attractive and versatile alternative (Chart 1). The facile manipulation of the 3-and 5-substituents of the pyrazolyl rings allows the fine-tuning of the ligand size and thereby implies the possibility of controlling the metal coordination sphere to an unprecedented degree.

Thus. the indiscriminate use of measured rate constants can in unfavorable cases lead to serious errors and consequent incorrect mechanistic interpretation. A simplified method for obtaining rate constants from dynamic NMR experiments in which the exchange processes are defined by more than a single rate-limiting step is described.
