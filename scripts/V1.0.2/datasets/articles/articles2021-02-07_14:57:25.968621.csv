75432,Assay for lipid peroxides in animal tissues by thiobarbituric acid reaction,1979,Hiroshi Ohkawa and Nobuko Ohishi and Kunio Yagi,95,Analytical biochemistry,2,351-358,Academic Press,The reaction of lipid peroxides in animal tissues with thiobarbituric acid was dependent on pH of the reaction mixture as was the case for linoleic acid hydroperoxide. The optimum pH was found to be 3.5. Taking this fact into consideration. a standard procedure for the assay of lipid peroxide level in animal tissues by their reaction with thiobarbituric acid was developed as follows. Ten percent (w v tissue homogenate was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate. acetate buffer (pH 3.5). and aqueous solution of thiobarbituric acid. After heating at 95° C for 60 min. the red pigment produced was extracted with n-butanol-pyridine mixture and estimated by the absorbance at 532nm. As an external standard. tetramethoxy-propane was used. and lipid peroxide level was expressed in terms of nmol malondialdehyde.

Biotechnology. and Agrochemistry,Hairy root clones of Scopolia japonica wereestablished by selection of adventitious roots formedon the root segments inoculated with Agrobacteriumrhizogenes strain 1 5834. Twenty-nine isolated hairy root clones displayed various phenotypes characterized by growth rate. opine production and tropane alkaloid production. Of these. two highly alkaloid productive clones SI and S22 were examined for their growth rate and alkaloid productivity under various cultural conditions.

In these mutants and a mutant (M55) lacking ndhB. CO2 uptake was much more strongly inhibited than HCO3− uptake. i.e.. the activities of CO2 and HCO3− uptake in B1 were 9 and 85% of those in the WT. respectively. Most of the mutants grew very slowly or did not grow at all at pH 6.5 or 7.0 in air. and their ability to grow under these conditions was correlated with CO2 uptake capacity.

The flower color of commercial varieties of Petunia hybrida was successfully modified by the suppression of endogenous flavonoid biosynthetic genes. the expression of a hetelorogous flavonoid biosynthetic gene. and the combination of both. Flower color changed from purple to almost white or from purple to red by the suppression of the endogenous gene expression. from red to orange by the down-regulation of the flavonoid 3!-hydroxylase gene and the expression of the rose dihydroflavonol 4-reductase gene. and from violet to pale violet by the expression of the flavonol synthase or flavone synthase gene. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of metabolic engineering of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway to modify flower color.

The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the residues essential to the catalytic activity and substrate binding in bacterial and plant isoamylases and GlgX proteins were all conserved in the GlgX protein of S. elongatus PCC 7942. The role of GlgX in the cyanobacterium was examined by insertional inactivation of the gene. Disruption of the glgX gene resulted in the enhanced fluctuation of glycogen content in the cells during light–dark cycles of the culture. although the effect was marginal. The glycogen of the glgX mutant was enriched with very short chains with degree of polymerization 2 to 4. When the mutant was transformed with putative glgX genes of Synechocystis sp.

Academic Press, New York Inc",,93,,"The esters of pentavalent phosphorus react with nucleophiles to alkylate as well as phosphorylate them. The chemical and biochemical significances of the former reaction for organophosphorus pesticides are discussed. The degradation of organophosphorus insecticides occurs often through the participation of alkylation reaction. The isomerization of O-methyl phosphorothionates to S-methyl phosphorothiolates in the presence of dimethylformamide is owing to the alkylating property of the esters. The property may contribute to a certain type of detoxication mechanisms. Saligenin cyclic phosphates are decomposed by the reaction with some oximes to salicylate the oximes.

However. fruit set of parthenocarpic tomato genotypes. which often bears seedless fruit. is not reduced when grown under a high temperature. The cause of seedless fruit development was studied with the aim of increasing the seed number in parthenocarpic tomato. Ovule number at anthesis in parthenocarpic and non-parthenocarpic fruit did not differ. but the proportion of undeveloped ovules increased with time after anthesis in parthenocarpic tomato. whereas most ovules in non-parthenocarpic tomato developed normally. Pollen grains germinated on the stigma and extruded pollen tubes in parthenocarpic and non-parthenocarpic tomatoes. but in parthenocarpic tomato. pollen tube elongation was markedly inhibited in the style base. Elongation of pollen tubes on agar containing indoleacetic acid (IAA) was depressed in parthenocarpic and non-parthenocarpic tomato plants. p-Chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB). which inhibits auxin action. did not affect the fruit set and fresh weight in either type of tomato. although seed number per fruit in parthenocarpic tomato was significantly increased from 13 ± 2 to 74 ± 6 seeds by PCIB treatment. These results indicated that a high IAA concentration in the ovary of parthenocarpic tomato inhibited pollen tube elongation. and that poor fertilization resulted in failure of ovule development. Moreover. floral organs in parthenocarpic tomato were normally developed as in non-parthenocarpic tomato. and seed development could be induced in parthenocarpic tomato by PCIB treatment.,True,nCRIyxYAAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC,8,https://journals.ashs.org/jashs/view/journals/jashs/135/1/article-p3.xml,12279146574556457561,/scholar?cites=12279146574556457561,,https://journals.ashs.org/jashs/view/journals/jashs/135/1/article-p3.xml,0,0,0

75629,Effects of crossing parents and artificial crossing stage on seed development of parthenocarpic tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum],2008,H Ohkawa and S Sugahara and K Yabe,,Horticultural Research (Japan),,,,To identify factors involved in seed development of parthenocarpic tomato. the effects of combinations of crossing parents and crossing stage on seed development of parthenocarpic tomato were examined. And the ovary size of parthenocarpic tomato before and after the flowering stage was compared with that of non-parthenocarpic tomato. When the seed parent was the nonparthenocarpic tomato cultivar'Momotaro york'. the seeded fruit rate was 100% irrespective of the pollen parent. there were about two hundred seeds per fruit. When the seed parent was the parthenocarpic tomato pure bred strain'PASK-1'or'PF811-K'. the seeded fruit rate was 72-94% irrespective of the pollen parent. there were 7.6-29.9 seeds per fruit. Therefore. it was suggested that seed development of parthenocarpic tomato was affected by the seed parent irrespective of the pollen parent. and seeds were apt to remain undeveloped when the seed parent was parthenocarpic. Concerning artificial crossing stage on seed development of parthenocarpic tomato. the seeded fruit rate of non-parthenocarpic tomato cultivar'Momotaro york'was 100% irrespective of artificial crossing stage. and the numbers of seeds per fruit of'Momotaro york'remained standard. The seeded fruit rate of'Renaissance'two days after flowering was 8% in spring and 33% in autumn. Those values were very low compared with 96% in spring and 87% in autumn on flowering.

The inhibitory effect of triphenyl phosphate (TPP) on the esterases of the house-fly [Musca domestica musca domestica Subject Category: Organism Namessee more details L.] was examined. By means of agar-gel electrophoresis. saligenin cyclic phosphorus esters analogous to the active metabolite of tri-o-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) were compared with TPP for the specificity of their anti-esterase activity. The anti-esterase activity of TPP was about ten thousand times less than that of the TOCP metabolite. For agar-gel electrophoresis. β-naphthyl acetate and dimethylaminophenyl acetate were excellent substrates for esterases. They were immediately hydrolysed by many esterases. and the hydrolysis products were easily coloured by diazotisation.

To establish the technology to promote seed formation in pat-2 parthenocarpic tomato plants. we examined the effects of paclobutrazol. a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor. on seed formation. The parthenocarpic F1 cultivar ‘Renaissance’. that has the homozygote recessive gene pat-2. was treated with paclobutrazol at 0 (control). 0.2. 1. 5. or 25 mg per pot (5.1 L) by irrigation to the culture medium. With increasing application of paclobutrazol. stem diameter increased. while stem length. leaf length. leaf width. and fruit fresh weight decreased. The percentage of fruits with seeds increased with increasing levels of paclobutrazol. and it reached 100% with 1 mg/pot and higher. Seed number per fruit increased from 12 at 0 mg/pot of paclobutrazol to 52 and 74 at 1 and 5 mg/pot. respectively. To confirm the practicality of this technology. the parthenocarpic purebred strain ‘PASK-1’. the seed parent of ‘Renaissance’. was treated with 0 (control). 1. or 5 mg/pot of paclobutrazol. All flowers of ‘PASK-1’were emasculated before flowering and crossed at flowering with pollen of the parthenocarpic purebred strain ‘PF811K’. the pollen parent of ‘Renaissance’. The percentage of fruits with seeds increased from 59% at 0 mg/pot of paclobutrazol to higher than 95% at 1 and 5 mg/pot. Seed number per fruit increased from 21 at 0 mg/pot of paclobutrazol to 45 and 46 at 1 and 5 mg/pot. respectively.

It was the first case of immunoassay used for diagnostics. measuring glucose levels in diabetic patients. Later. Rosalyn Yalow received a Nobel Prize for this effort. In the 1970s Van Weeman and Schuurs replaced the radiolabel with enzyme labels. This reduced the hazard from radiation. and the turnover of substrate by the enzyme resulted in an amplification of the signal. With radioimmunoassay (RIA) a single binding event was detected by a single radioactive molecule. whereas a single binding event by an enzyme-labeled ligand resulted in increasing color formation as the enzyme turns over substrate.

In 1997. decommissioning plan was submitted to the STA. and dismantling began. Decommissioning program of JRR-2 is divided into 4 phases. Phases 1 and 2 had already been completely finished without any trouble. Furthermore. the phase 3 was also finished in February. 2004 as planned. The worker exposure was achieved well under the estimate in the phase 1. 2 and 3. The reactor will be removed in the phase 4 by one piece removal technique. The reactor building is planned to use effectively as hot experimental facilities after decommissioning. In the original decommission program of JRR-2. the phase 4 was expected to start in 2004 and would finish at 2007. however. in order to reduce the quantity and activity level of radioactive waste in the phase 4. the decommissioning program was revised to maintaining the reactor in safe storage.(author),True,nCRIyxYAAAAJ:mWEH9CqjF64C,1,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:35098587,7479173515299504240,/scholar?cites=7479173515299504240,,,0,0,0

In PL Tokyo Health Care Center. we attempt to perform physical and brain check-up combined with PWV.Purpose Multiphasic health test. including physical and brain check-up. is usually finished within three hours. PWV must be measured in the same day before or after gastrography with scopolamine Butylbromide. We need to confirm whether this anticholinergic drug has effects on PWV. The purpose of this study is to evaluate serial changes of PWV after treatment with scopolamine butyl-bromide.Method We analyzed serial PWVs in nine volunteers (men). The range of age was 28 to 59 years and the mean age (mean±SD) was 51.1±9.4 years. The first brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) was measured at noon before injection of scopolamine butylbromide. Scopolamine Butylbromide (20 mg) was administered intramuscularly at 1 PM. baPWV was performed at 30. 60. 120 and 180 minutes after administration of scopolamine butylbromide. baPWV was applied by form PWV/ABI sphygmograph. Colin AT company. Japan.Results Heart rate was increased approximately 8.8% at 30 minutes after injection of scopolamine butylbromide. Afterwards. heart rate returned to the baseline levels. baPWV was increased slightly at 30 minutes after injection. but baPWV did not significantly change after 60 minutes of injection.Conclusion Intramuscular administration of scopolamine butyl-bromide transiently increased heart rate but did not significantly act on baPWV.

It was demonstrated that dietary FMN and FAD are hydrolyzed to riboflavin by phosphatases in intestinal brush borders. Absorbed riboflavin is bound to plasma proteins through weak association with albumin or tight association with specific riboflavin-binding proteins. As for the metabolites appearing in the urine. it was believed that the dominant excreted form was riboflavin. and small amounts of 10-hydroxyethylflavin in humans (1) and lumichrome and lumiflavin in rats (2) were detected. However. the fact that several types of flavin covalently bound to proteins exist in higher ani-mals led us to suspect that some unknown metabolic pathway of flavin in addition to the above ones is present and that certain metabolites with a modified isoalloxazine ring are excreted into the urine. With this view in mind. we examin-ed in detail flavin compounds in the urine of humans and rats and found some new metabolites (3-6).

These transgenic rice plants showed broad cross-tolerance toward various herbicides and metabolized them. The introduced human P450 protein essentially just enhanced the natural metabolism of herbicides in the transgenic rice plants. These transgenic rice plants should be important not only for developing herbicide-tolerant lines of rice. but also for decreasing herbicide residues in rice. In addition. transgenic rice plants should prove useful in implementing effective. inexpensive methods of decreasing various chemicals that are widespread in agricultural environments.,True,nCRIyxYAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC,0,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-2005-0892.ch002,,,,,0,0,0

The localization and the function of this protein were carefully assessed in Synechocystis 6803. Although the cyanobacterial PsbQ is predicted to be a soluble protein with one transit peptide. it was unexpectedly extracted to Triton X114 phase. However. trypsin digestion revealed that PsbQ was highly exposed to the lumenal space. PS II complexes purified from the mutant lacking psbQ showed impaired oxygen evolving activity. Furthermore. witout PsbQ. the donor side of PS II became remarkably sensitive to NH 2 OH. And. the cytochrome c550 (PsbV) partially disappeared in the purified PS II complex suggesting the structural vulnerability without PsbQ. These findings confirm that PsbQ really associates to the lumenal side of PS II with anchor to the lipid layer. and functions at the water oxidizing system.,True,nCRIyxYAAAAJ:LgRImbQfgY4C,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jspp/2004/0/2004_0_766/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0,0,0
75737,PsbP and PsbQ proteins have functional roles in cyanobacteria Photosystem II.,2004,Hiroshi Ohkawa and Leeann Thornton and Yasuhiro Kashino and Nir Keren and Johnna Roose and Himadri Pakrasi,,,,210-210,The Japanese Society of Plant Physiologists,Photosystem II. a large membrane protein complex. catalyzes the important reaction of water oxidation to molecular oxygen. Many PSII subunits are conserved between plants. green algae. and cyanobacteria. The extrinsic proteins that comprise the oxygen evolving complex differ between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. In the current accepted model. higher plants and green algae have PsbO. PsbP and PsbQ. while cyanobacteria contain PsbO. PsbV and PsbU. Interestingly. homologs of both PsbP and PsbQ have been found according to previous genomic and proteomic analysis in cyanobacterium. Synechocystis 6803. To clarify the function of these two proteins in cyanobacterial PSII. we have analyzed isolated PSII complexes from knockout mutants of both proteins. In this presentation. we demonstrate that the functional roles of PsbP and PsbQ proteins are conserved between cyanobacteria and plants and that five lumenal extrinsic proteins are present in cyanobacterial PSII.[Supported by National Science Foundation],True,nCRIyxYAAAAJ:Bg7qf7VwUHIC,0,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jspp/2004/0/2004_0_210/_article/-char/ja/,,,,,0,0,0

Leaf surface of'Yuryoku'seen through a scanning electron microscope was smooth. Compared with'Kinsyu'. the colors of outer leaf and head surface of'Yuryoku'were as follows: The value of L sup* and a sup* were small and the b sup* value was large. The glossy rates (Gs75 deg) of outer leaf and head surface leaf of'Yuryoku'were higher than those of'Kinsyu'. The touch-angles of water drop on outer leaf and head surface leaf of'Yuryoku'were smaller than those of'Kinsyu'. There were no large differences between'Yuryoku'and'Kinsyu'except that the weight of'Yuryoku'was a little lighter than'Kinsyu'.

They are all tagged within slr1512 (designated sbtA). We show that SbtA-mediated transport is induced by low CO2. requires Na+. and plays the major role in HCO3- uptake in Synechocystis. Inactivation of slr1509 (homologous to ntpJ encoding a Na+/K+-translocating protein) abolished the ability of cells to grow at (Na+) higher than 100 mM and severely depressed the activity of the SbtA-mediated HCO3- transport.

Six regenerated plants for P4501A1 (GC) and twenty plants for P4501A1/YR fused enzyme (GFC) were selected by kanamycin resistance. Southern blot analysis revealed that one of GC plants and ten of GFC plants showed several bands of P450 cDNA or its fused enzyme gene. The GC plant No. 1160 was found to produce a detectable amount of mRNA corresponding to 1.6 kb-P450 cDNA. whereas the GFC plants gave a much less amount of mRNA corresponding to 3.5 kb-P450/YR fused enzyme gene. Western blot analysis showed that the GC plant No. 1160 produced a large amount of a 59kDa protein corresponding to rat P4501A1. No GFC plants gave a detectable amount of a 130kDa fused protein corresponding to rat P4501A1/YR fused enzyme. 7-Ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities of the transgenic plants were 1.4 to 3.5 and 1.3 to 3.5 times higher than those of the control plants. respectively.[14C]-Labeled chlortoluron (CT) was more rapidly metabolized through N-demethylation and p-methyl hydroxylation to none or less phytotoxic metabolites in the GC plant No. 1160. while it was also metabolized through N-demethylation in the control plants.

This cultivation method is as follows: 1) Supplying a culture solution. which is a mixture of water and fertilizer; the concentration of culture solution is controlled by feedback from regular real-time nutritional diagnosis. 2) There is no basal fertilizer before direct planting of plug seedlings; however.'the YAMAZAKI tomato recipe'(excluding micronutrients) or diluted solution of compound liquid fertilizer is used as the culture solution. 3) The starting tine of irrigation is judged by pF-value of tensiometer set in culture soil of 15cm depth at the side of irrigation plastic tube. and the culture solution is added 2 liters per plant each time. The starting time of irrigation on early growing period (until the flowering. period of third or fourth fruit cluster). in semi-forcing culture and forcing culture. was suitable at 2.5 of pF-value because of good yield of high-grade and second high-grade fruits and a little amount of inferior fruits. It is considered that the upper level of nitrogen concentration of culture solution on early growing period is about 100ppm. Controlling the concentration of culture solution by the result of regular nutritional diagnosis. when a nitrate concentration of petiole juice in the enlargement period of the second fruit cluster and the period after its had been kept up to 3.000 ppm or less. the occurrence rate of puffy fruit increased and the yield of high-grade and second high-grade fruits decreased remarkably.

An antibody specific for the phosphomotif generated by the kinase is used to isolate phosphorylated substrates by immunoprecipitation. and the isolated proteins are identified by tandem mass spectrometry of peptides. This method was applied to the identification of substrates for the protein kinase Akt. which specifically phosphorylates the RXRXXS/T motif. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with insulin to activate Akt. and the putative Akt substrate proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the phospho form of this motif.

Hypoxia promotes the resistance of tumor cells to specific therapies. We therefore explored a possible link between hypoxia and Akt activity. We found that Akt was prolyl-hydroxylated by the oxygen-dependent hydroxylase EglN1. The von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL) bound directly to hydroxylated Akt and inhibited Akt activity. In cells lacking oxygen or functional pVHL. Akt was activated to promote cell survival and tumorigenesis. We also identified cancer-associated Akt mutations that impair Akt hydroxylation and subsequent recognition by pVHL. thus leading to Akt hyperactivation.

In this structure. p20 and p10 catalytic domains of a single pc-9 interact with nucleotide binding domains of adjacent Apaf-1 subunits.

Interestingly. the transcriptional activity of the S251A mutant protein …,True,mMr0SVUAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,73,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820381230,10785691191904431460,/scholar?cites=10785691191904431460,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820381230,0,0,0

To understand the altered cellular environment that these changes create. we took advantage of the Drosophila model system and used targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to profile the metabolic changes that occur when RBF1. the fly ortholog of pRB. is removed. We show that RBF1-depleted tissues and larvae are sensitive to fasting. Depletion of RBF1 causes major changes in nucleotide synthesis and glutathione metabolism. Under fasting conditions. these changes interconnect. and the increased replication demand of RBF1-depleted larvae is associated with the depletion of glutathione pools. In vivo 13C isotopic tracer analysis shows that RBF1-depleted larvae increase the flux of glutamine toward glutathione synthesis. presumably to minimize oxidative stress …,True,mMr0SVUAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,72,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/2/182.short,3230279782031246379,/scholar?cites=3230279782031246379,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/27/2/182.full.pdf,0,0,0

Fragments of collagen α1(I) and α2(I) proteins extracted from fossil bones of Tyrannosaurus rex and Mammut americanum (mastodon) were analyzed with a variety of phylogenetic methods. Despite missing sequence data. the mastodon groups with elephant and the T. rex groups with birds. consistent with predictions based on genetic and morphological data for mastodon and on morphological data for T. rex. Our findings suggest that molecular data from long-extinct organisms may have the potential for resolving relationships at critical areas in the vertebrate evolutionary tree that have. so far. been phylogenetically intractable.,True,mMr0SVUAAAAJ:4fGpz3EwCPoC,72,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/320/5875/499.abstract,14535041140887400069,/scholar?cites=14535041140887400069,,,0,0,0
75906,ZBTB7A acts as a tumor suppressor through the transcriptional repression of glycolysis,2014,Xue-Song Liu and Jenna E Haines and Elie K Mehanna and Matthew D Genet and Issam Ben-Sahra and John M Asara and Brendan D Manning and Zhi-Min Yuan,28,Genes & development,17,1917-1928,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,Elevated glycolysis is a common metabolic trait of cancer. but what drives such metabolic reprogramming remains incompletely clear. We report here a novel transcriptional repressor-mediated negative regulation of glycolysis. ZBTB7A. a member of the POK (POZ/BTB and Krüppel) transcription repressor family. directly binds to the promoter and represses the transcription of critical glycolytic genes. including GLUT3. PFKP. and PKM. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data sets reveals that the ZBTB7A locus is frequently deleted in many human tumors. Significantly. reduced ZBTB7A expression correlates with up-regulation of the glycolytic genes and poor survival in colon cancer patients. Remarkably. while ZBTB7A-deficient tumors progress exceedingly fast. they exhibit an unusually heightened sensitivity to glycolysis inhibition. Our study uncovers a novel tumor suppressor role of ZBTB7A in directly …,True,mMr0SVUAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,71,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/28/17/1917.short,3165737351239326638,/scholar?cites=3165737351239326638,,http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/28/17/1917.full.pdf,0,0,0

As a result. investigation of the potential role of extracellular tyrosine phosphorylation in physiological and pathological tissue regulation has not been possible. Here. we show that VLK. a putative protein kinase previously shown to be essential in embryonic development. is a secreted protein kinase. with preference for tyrosine. that phosphorylates a broad range of secreted and ER-resident substrate proteins. We find that VLK is rapidly and quantitatively secreted from platelets in response to stimuli and can tyrosine phosphorylate coreleased proteins utilizing endogenous as well as exogenous ATP sources. We propose that discovery of VLK activity provides an explanation for the extensive and conserved pattern of extracellular tyrosine …,True,mMr0SVUAAAAJ:1qzjygNMrQYC,71,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414008757,8273596917339734802,/scholar?cites=8273596917339734802,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414008757,0,0,0
