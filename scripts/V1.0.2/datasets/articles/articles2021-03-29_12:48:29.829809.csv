One approach to meet these challenges is to increase reliance on CAM crops. such as Agave and Opuntia. for biomass production on semi‐arid. abandoned. marginal. or degraded agricultural lands. Major research efforts are now underway to assess the productivity of CAM crop species and to harness the WUE of CAM by engineering this pathway into existing food. feed. and bioenergy crops.

The method. however. is limited in the number of peptides that can be measured in one run. This number can be markedly increased by scheduling the acquisition if the accurate retention time (RT) of each peptide is known. Here we present iRT. an empirically derived dimensionless peptide‐specific value that allows for highly accurate RT prediction. The iRT of a peptide is a fixed number relative to a standard set of reference iRT‐peptides that can be transferred across laboratories and chromatographic systems.

1225755,Proteomics reveals novel Drosophila seminal fluid proteins transferred at mating,2008,Geoffrey D Findlay and Xianhua Yi and Michael J MacCoss and Willie J Swanson,6,PLoS Biol,7,e178,Public Library of Science,Across diverse taxa. seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) transferred at mating affect the reproductive success of both sexes. Such reproductive proteins often evolve under positive selection between species; because of this rapid divergence. Sfps are hypothesized to play a role in speciation by contributing to reproductive isolation between populations. In Drosophila. individual Sfps have been characterized and are known to alter male sperm competitive ability and female post-mating behavior. but a proteomic-scale view of the transferred Sfps has been missing. Here we describe a novel proteomic method that uses whole-organism isotopic labeling to detect transferred Sfps in mated female D. melanogaster. We identified 63 proteins. which were previously unknown to function in reproduction. and confirmed the transfer of dozens of predicted Sfps. Relative quantification of protein abundance revealed that several of these novel Sfps are abundant in seminal fluid. Positive selection and tandem gene duplication are the prevailing forces of Sfp evolution. and comparative proteomics with additional species revealed lineage-specific changes in seminal fluid content. We also report a proteomic-based gene discovery method that uncovered 19 previously unannotated genes in D. melanogaster. Our results demonstrate an experimental method to identify transferred proteins in any system that is amenable to isotopic labeling. and they underscore the power of combining proteomic and evolutionary analyses to shed light on the complex process of Drosophila reproduction.,True,icweOB0AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,292,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,1027611748188091802,/scholar?cites=1027611748188091802,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060178,0,0,0

Although Rpn10 or Rad23 restored UbSic1 recruitment to either mutant. rescue of degradation by Rad23 uncovered a requirement for the VWA domain of Rpn10. In vivo analyses confirmed that Rad23 and the multiubiquitin binding domain of Rpn10 contribute to Sic1 degradation. Turnover studies of multiple UPS substrates uncovered an unexpected degree of specificity in their requirements for MCBPs. We propose that recruitment of substrates to …,True,zAJ3NWEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,515,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867404005835,17933372502778495319,/scholar?cites=17933372502778495319,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867404005835,0,0,0

Sox2. Klf4. and c-Myc has very low efficiency. To increase the reprogramming efficiency and better understand the process. we sought to identify factors that mediate reprogramming with higher efficiency. We established an assay to screen nuclear fractions from extracts of pluripotent mouse cells based on Oct4 reactivation. Using proteomics. we identified components of the ATP-dependent BAF chromatin-remodeling complex. which significantly increases reprogramming efficiency when used together with the four factors. The reprogrammed cells could transmit to the germline and exhibited pluripotency. Reprogramming remained highly efficient when c-Myc was not present but BAF components were overexpressed.

Binding of p97 to substrates is mediated by cofactors that contain ubiquitin-binding domains. We employed “network proteomics” to show that p97 assembles with all of the 13 mammalian UBX-domain proteins. The UBX proteins that bind ubiquitin conjugates also interact with dozens of E3 ubiquitin ligases. only one of which had been previously linked to p97. In particular. UBXD7 links p97 to the ubiquitin ligase CUL2/VHL and its substrate hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α).

Mdv1p. and Dnm1p. Mitochondrial division relies on the recruitment of the dynamin-related protein Dnm1p to mitochondria. Dnm1p recruitment depends on the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Fis1p. Mdv1p interacts with Fis1p and Dnm1p. but is thought to act at a late step during fission because Mdv1p is dispensable for Dnm1p localization. We identify the WD40 repeat protein Caf4p as a Fis1p-associated protein that localizes to mitochondria in a Fis1p-dependent manner. Caf4p interacts with each component of the fission apparatus: with Fis1p and Mdv1p through its NH2-terminal half and with Dnm1p through its COOH-terminal WD40 domain.

In computer science. intelligent agents are frequently used to make autonomous decisions in complex environments. Here we develop and describe a framework for intelligent data acquisition and real-time database searching and showcase selected examples. The intelligent agent is implemented in the MaxQuant computational proteomics environment. termed MaxQuant Real-Time.

Here. we ask whether microRNAs affect the interpretation of TCR signaling. We find that Dicer-deficient CD4 T cells fail to correctly discriminate between activating and anergy-inducing stimuli and produce IL-2 in the absence of co-stimulation. Excess IL-2 production by Dicer-deficient CD4 T cells was sufficient to override anergy induction in WT T cells and to restore inducible Foxp3 expression in Il2-deficient CD4 T cells. Phosphorylation of Akt on S473 and of S6 ribosomal protein was increased and sustained in Dicer-deficient CD4 T cells. indicating elevated mTOR activity.

Major determinants of blood pressure are vasodilatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO) released from the endothelium under the influence of fluid shear stress exerted by the flowing blood. Several endothelial signaling processes mediating fluid shear stress–induced formation and release of vasodilatory factors have been described.

While the mechanism of action for this acquired immunity is currently under investigation. the response of Cas protein expression to phage infection has yet to be elucidated. In this study. we employed shotgun proteomics to measure the global proteome expression in a model system for studying the CRISPR/Cas response in S. thermophilus DGCC7710 infected with phage 2972. Host and viral proteins were simultaneously measured following inoculation at two different multiplicities of infection and across various time points using two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Thirty-seven out of forty predicted viral proteins were detected. including all proteins of the structural virome and viral effector proteins. In total. 1.013 of 2.079 predicted S. thermophilus proteins were detected. facilitating the monitoring of host protein synthesis changes in response to virus infection. Importantly. Cas proteins from all four CRISPR loci in the S. thermophilus DGCC7710 genome were detected. including loci previously thought to be inactive. Many Cas proteins were found to be constitutively expressed. but several demonstrated increased abundance following infection. including the signature Cas9 proteins from the CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 loci. which are key players in the interference phase of the CRISPR/Cas response.

The improved spectral quality enables more accurate de novo sequencing for identification of post-translational modifications and amino acid polymorphisms. In this study. a new de novo sequencing algorithm. called Vonode. has been developed specifically for analysis of such high-resolution tandem mass spectra. To fully exploit the high mass accuracy of these spectra. a unique scoring system is proposed to evaluate sequence tags based primarily on mass accuracy information of fragment ions. Consensus sequence tags were inferred for 11.422 spectra with an average peptide length of 5.5 residues from a total of 40.297 input spectra acquired in a 24-hour proteomics measurement of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The accuracy of inferred consensus sequence tags was 84%. According to our comparison. the performance of Vonode was shown to be superior to the PepNovo v2.0 algorithm. in terms of the number of de novo sequenced spectra and the sequencing accuracy. Here. we improved de novo sequencing performance by developing a new algorithm specifically for high-resolution tandem mass spectral data.

In this study. we have benchmarked several strategies for increasing microbial peptide spectral matching in metaproteomic datasets using protein predictions generated from matched metagenomic sequences from the same human fecal samples. Additionally. we investigated the impact of mass spectrometry-based filters (high mass accuracy. delta correlation). and de novo peptide sequencing on the number and robustness of peptide-spectrum assignments in these complex datasets.

Previous studies indicated that several stress-related proteins and changes in the ZM4 membrane lipid composition may contribute to ethanol tolerance. However. the molecular mechanisms of its ethanol stress response have not been elucidated fully.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. ethanol stress responses were investigated using systems biology approaches. Medium supplementation with an initial 47 g/L (6% v/v) ethanol reduced Z. mobilis ZM4 glucose consumption. growth rate and ethanol productivity compared to that of untreated controls. A proteomic analysis of early exponential growth identified about one thousand proteins. or approximately 55% of the predicted ZM4 proteome. Proteins related to metabolism and stress response such as chaperones and key regulators were more abundant in the early ethanol stress condition. Transcriptomic studies indicated that the response of ZM4 to ethanol is dynamic. complex and involves many genes from all the different functional categories. Most down-regulated genes were related to translation and ribosome biogenesis. while the ethanol-upregulated genes were mostly related to cellular processes and metabolism. Transcriptomic data were used to update Z. mobilis ZM4 operon models. Furthermore. correlations among the transcriptomic. proteomic and metabolic data were examined. Among significantly expressed genes or proteins. we observe higher correlation coefficients when fold-change values are higher.

However. understanding of the microbiology of this process is limited because most culture-independent methods cannot link metabolic processes to the organisms present. and this link to causative agents is necessary to predict the results of perturbations on the system. We collected soil samples at two sub-root depths (10–20 cm and 30–40 cm) before and after a rainfall-driven nutrient perturbation event in a Northern California grassland that experiences a Mediterranean climate. From ten samples. we reconstructed 198 metagenome-assembled genomes that represent all major phylotypes. We also quantified 6.835 proteins and 175 metabolites and showed that after the rain event the concentrations of many sugars and amino acids approach zero at the base of the soil profile. Unexpectedly. the genomes of novel members of the Gemmatimonadetes and Candidate Phylum Rokubacteria phyla encode pathways for methylotrophy. We infer that these abundant organisms contribute substantially to carbon turnover in the soil. given that methylotrophy proteins were among the most abundant proteins in the proteome. Previously undescribed Bathyarchaeota and Thermoplasmatales archaea are abundant in deeper soil horizons and are inferred to contribute appreciably to aromatic amino acid degradation.

Cellulosome samples isolated from cultures grown on these carbon sources were compared to 15N labeled cellulosome samples isolated from crystalline cellulose-grown cultures. In total from all samples. proteomic analysis identified 59 dockerin- and 8 cohesin-module containing components. including 16 previously undetected cellulosomal subunits. Many cellulosomal components showed differential protein abundance in the presence of non-cellulose substrates in the growth medium. Cellulosome samples from amorphous cellulose. cellobiose and pretreated switchgrass-grown cultures displayed the most distinct differences …,True,vukA8JAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,249,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005271,2513493083635529996,/scholar?cites=2513493083635529996,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005271,0,0,0

Inc.,Anomaly detection is an important problem with multiple applications. and thus has been studied for decades in various research domains. In the past decade there has been a growing interest in anomaly detection in data represented as networks. or graphs. largely because of their robust expressiveness and their natural ability to represent complex relationships. Originally. techniques focused on anomaly detection in static graphs. which do not change and are capable of representing only a single snapshot of data. As real‐world networks are constantly changing. there has been a shift in focus to dynamic graphs. which evolve over time.In this survey. we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of anomaly detection in dynamic networks. concentrating on the state‐of‐the‐art methods.

Inc.,Community detection is a common problem in graph data analytics that consists of finding groups of densely connected nodes with few connections to nodes outside of the group. In particular. identifying communities in large‐scale networks is an important task in many scientific domains. In this review. we evaluated eight state‐of‐the‐art and five traditional algorithms for overlapping and disjoint community detection on large‐scale real‐world networks with known ground‐truth communities. These 13 algorithms were empirically compared using goodness metrics that measure the structural properties of the identified communities. as well as performance metrics that evaluate these communities against the ground‐truth. Our results show that these two types of metrics are not equivalent.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Modern large-scale scientific simulations running on HPC systems generate data in the order of terabytes during a single run. To lessen the I/O load during a simulation run. scientists are forced to capture data infrequently. thereby making data collection an inherently lossy process. Yet. lossless compression techniques are hardly suitable for scientific data due to its inherently random nature; for the applications used here. they offer less than 10% compression rate. They also impose significant overhead during decompression. making them unsuitable for data analysis and visualization that require repeated data access.To address this problem. we propose an effective method for In-situ Sort-And-B-spline Error-bounded Lossy Abatement (ISABELA) of scientific data that is widely regarded as effectively incompressible.

Once enumerated. maximal cliques are widely used to solve problems in areas such as 3-D protein structure alignment. genome mapping. gene expression analysis. and detection of social hierarchies. Even the most efficient serial MCE algorithms require large amounts of time to enumerate the maximal cliques in networks arising from these problems that contain hundreds. thousands. or larger numbers of vertices. The previous attempts to provide practical solutions to the MCE problem through parallel implementation have had limited success. largely due to a number of challenges inherent to the nature of the MCE combinatorial search space.

Variation of density and ηi is in the same scale as the turbulence correlation length. compressing the turbulence in the density slope region. The resulting ion thermal flux is on the order of experimentally inferred values.

We assume that a virtual n× p (items× features) data matrix is distributed by blocks of rows (items). where n> p and the distribution among s locations is determined by a given application. Our approach is to perform local PCA on local data without any data movement and then move and merge the local PCA results into a global PCA. The representation of local data by a few local principal components greatly reduces data transfers with minimal degradation in accuracy. We exploit the fact that most high-dimensional data have lower intrinsic dimensionality thus allowing a good lower-dimensional representation. Existing methods that bring data to a central location require O (np) data transfer even if only a few principal components are needed. In the worst case. when an exact PCA is computed. our algorithm is min (O (np). O (sp2)).

With the discrepancy between I/O bandwidth and computational power. scientists are forced to capture data infrequently. thereby making data collection an inherently lossy process. Although data compression can be an effective solution. the random nature of real‐valued scientific datasets renders lossless compression routines ineffective.

1225861,A high-throughput de novo sequencing approach for shotgun proteomics using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry,2010,Chongle Pan and Byung H Park and William H McDonald and Patricia A Carey and Jillian F Banfield and Nathan C VerBerkmoes and Robert L Hettich and Nagiza F Samatova,11,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-14,BioMed Central,High-resolution tandem mass spectra can now be readily acquired with hybrid instruments. such as LTQ-Orbitrap and LTQ-FT. in high-throughput shotgun proteomics workflows. The improved spectral quality enables more accurate de novo sequencing for identification of post-translational modifications and amino acid polymorphisms. In this study. a new de novo sequencing algorithm. called Vonode. has been developed specifically for analysis of such high-resolution tandem mass spectra. To fully exploit the high mass accuracy of these spectra. a unique scoring system is proposed to evaluate sequence tags based primarily on mass accuracy information of fragment ions. Consensus sequence tags were inferred for 11.422 spectra with an average peptide length of 5.5 residues from a total of 40.297 input spectra acquired in a 24-hour proteomics measurement of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. The accuracy of inferred consensus sequence tags was 84%. According to our comparison. the performance of Vonode was shown to be superior to the PepNovo v2.0 algorithm. in terms of the number of de novo sequenced spectra and the sequencing accuracy. Here. we improved de novo sequencing performance by developing a new algorithm specifically for high-resolution tandem mass spectral data.

Little is known about the function of this phosphorylation or its removal during DNA repair. Here. we demonstrate that the Drosophila Tip60 (dTip60) chromatin-remodeling complex acetylates nucleosomal phospho-H2Av and exchanges it with an unmodified H2Av. Both the histone acetyltransferase dTip60 as well as the adenosine triphosphatase Domino/p400 catalyze the exchange of phospho-H2Av.

We have built fission yeast microarrays. optimised protocols to improve array performance. and carried out experiments to assess various characteristics of microarrays. We designed PCR primers to amplify specific probes (180–500 bp) for all known and predicted fission yeast genes. which are printed in duplicate onto separate regions of glass slides together with control elements (~13.000 spots/slide). Fluorescence signal intensities depended on the size and intragenic position of the array elements. whereas the signal ratios were largely independent of element properties. Only the coding strand is covalently linked to the slides. and our array elements can discriminate transcriptional direction. The microarrays can distinguish sequences with up to 70% identity. above which cross-hybridisation contributes to the signal intensity. We tested the accuracy of signal ratios and measured the reproducibility of array data caused by biological and technical factors. Because the technical variability is lower. it is best to use samples prepared from independent biological experiments to obtain repeated measurements with swapping of fluorochromes to prevent dye bias.

Although Cro dimers are the only DNA-bound species observed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. cooperativity in Cro-DNA binding isotherms shows that the predominant free protein species is monomeric at nanomolar concentrations. Micromolar dissociation constants for Cro dimers have been measured in the absence of DNA by sedimentation equilibrium and gel filtration chromatography. Denaturation of Cro dimers in the 10 to 100 micromolar concentration range by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) is well modeled as a two-state process. with folded dimers and unfolded monomers as the only significantly …,True,9NQt-eUAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,75,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283697912560,15482291548616643804,/scholar?cites=15482291548616643804,,,0,0,0

Previous studies identified Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) as the mediator of gemcitabine resistance. but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this study. we show that Plk1 phosphorylation of Orc2 and Hbo1 mediates the resistance to gemcitabine. We show that the level of Plk1 expression positively correlates with gemcitabine resistance. both in pancreatic cancer cells and xenograft tumors. Overexpression of Plk1 increases gemcitabine resistance. while inhibition of Plk1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment.

In this tethered catalysis assay. constitutive modification of the protein to be screened for interactions is achieved by fusing it to its cognate modifying enzyme. with the physical linkage resulting in efficient catalysis. This catalysis maintains substrate modification even in the presence of antagonizing enzyme activities.

Since Cro dimer−operator complexes form at nanomolar concentrations of Cro subunits where free dimers are rare. these dimers must bind with compensating high affinities. Previous studies of the covalent dimer Cro V55C suggest little change in DNA binding affinity even though the dimeric species is quantitatively populated; this is an apparent contradiction to the expectation of high intrinsic dimer−DNA affinity. In contrast to the disulfide linkage at the center of the dimer interface in Cro V55C. polypeptide linkers that join the two subunits allow single-chain Cro repressors to bind operator DNA with picomolar affinities.

To define Prp19 connectivity and dynamic protein interactions within the spliceosome. we systematically queried the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome for Prp19 WD40 domain interaction partners by two-hybrid analysis. We report that in addition to S. cerevisiae Cwc2. the splicing factor Prp17 binds directly to the Prp19 WD40 domain in a 1∶1 ratio. Prp17 binds simultaneously with Cwc2 indicating that it is part of the core NTC complex. We also find that the previously uncharacterized protein Urn1 (Dre4 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe) directly interacts with Prp19. and that Dre4 is conditionally required for pre-mRNA splicing in S. pombe. S. pombe Dre4 and S. cerevisiae Urn1 co-purify U2. U5. and U6 snRNAs and multiple splicing factors. and dre4Δ and urn1Δ strains display numerous negative genetic interactions with known splicing mutants. The S. pombe Prp19-containing Dre4 complex co-purifies three previously uncharacterized proteins that participate in pre-mRNA splicing. likely before spliceosome activation.

We show that histone H3 plays a crucial role in activating the spindle assembly checkpoint in response to a defect in mitosis. Prior to anaphase. all chromosomes must attach to spindles emanating from the opposite spindle pole bodies. The tension between sister chromatids generated by the poleward pulling force is an integral part of chromosome biorientation.

However. as illustrated in Figure 1. the set of documents of interest to a particular user rarely map neatly to existing lists. A better solution is for a user to specify afi'lter that scans all lists. selecting interesting documents no matter what list they are in. Several mail systems support filtering based on a document's contents [3. 5. 6. 8]. A basic tenet of the Tapestry work is that more effective filtering can be done by involving humans in the filtering process. In addition to content-based filtering. the Tapestry system was designed and …,True,9Mapl04AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5409,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/138859.138867,5704407167619411646,/scholar?cites=5704407167619411646,,,0,0,0
1225994,What every computer scientist should know about floating-point arithmetic,1991,David Goldberg,23,,1,5-48,ACM,Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising. because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error. continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard. and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.,True,9Mapl04AAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C,2493,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/103162.103163,1715284306018957402,/scholar?cites=1715284306018957402,,http://lux.dmcs.p.lodz.pl/ak/IEEE754_article.pdf,0,0,0

Our goal was to provide a UNIX-like way of making remote files available to local programs without having to modify. or even recompile. those programs. In addition. we wanted remote file access to be comparable in speed to local file access. The overall design goals of the NFS were: Machine and Operating System Independence The protocols used should be independent of UNIX so that an NFS server can supply files to many different types of clients. The protocols should also be simple enough that they can be implemented on low end machines like the PC.

If such continuous queries examine only single records. this can be implemented by examining each record as it arrives. This is very efficient because only the incoming record needs to be scanned. This simple approach does not work for queries involving joins or time. The Tapestry system allows users to issue such queries over a database of mail and bulletin board messages. The user issues a static query. such as “show me all messages that have been replied to by Jones.” as though the database were fixed and unchanging.

The material is grouped under major headings called books and further subdivided into sections and chapters; section C of Book 7 is on computer programs. This chapter presents a digital computer model for simulating the unsteady flow regimen occurring in a singular reach or throughout a system of reaches composed of simply or multiply connected one-dimensional-flow channels governed by time-dependent forcing functions and boundary conditions. The model is broadly applicable to a wide range of hydrologic conditions and field situations. Channel geometry need not be prismatic. Reach lengths of the branches and segments used in the model need not be equal. Procedures to be followed in implementing the model to a specific field application are presented in a straightforward. step-by-step manner. Operational modeling capability is achieved by linking the model to a highly efficient storage-and-retrieval routine that accesses a data base containing time series of boundary values. This operational capability is enhanced by optional linkage to an extensive set of digital graphics subroutines.

Our text entry tool is designed around the idea that handwriting recognition algorithms will always be error prone. and has a different flavor from existing systems.

1226020,Solvation. reorganization energy. and biological catalysis,1998,William R Cannon and Stephen J Benkovic,273,,41,26257-26260,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,The question of how enzymes greatly enhance the rate of reactions has been discussed for years but remains a vigorously debated issue. Rapid progress has been made on the mechanism of individual enzymes by a combination of kinetic. chemical. and structural approaches. The push and pull of electrons and the resulting bond changes are well understood for many enzymes. However. the larger question of general features that enzymes use to produce rate accelerations of 108–1015 has remained a contentious issue. We believe that such rate accelerations can be readily explained by reasonable physical principles (1). Though much of this understanding stems from research done in the 1970s and 1980s. these insights are often underappreciated or even completely neglected when examining enzymic rate accelerations.

The ground state of the enzyme–substrate complex is shown to be related to the transition state through the mean force acting along the reaction path; as such. catalytic strategies cannot be resolved into ground state destabilization versus transition state stabilization. We compare the role of active-site residues in the chemical step with the analogous role played by solvent molecules in the environment of the noncatalysed reaction. We conclude that enzyme catalysis is significantly enhanced by the ability of the enzyme to preorganize the reaction environment. This complementation of the enzyme to the substrate's transition state geometry acts to eliminate the slow components of solvent reorganization required for reactions in aqueous solution. Dramatically strong binding of the transition state geometry is not required.,True,AlrLiSQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,165,https://www.nature.com/articles/nsb1096-821,129609945994190111,/scholar?cites=129609945994190111,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51357511/nsb1096-82120170114-25393-1b1jius.pdf,0,0,0

As a complex adaptive system. microbial communities show higher-order properties that are not present in individual microbes. but arise from their interactions. Predictive mathematical models not only help to understand the underlying principles of the dynamics and emergent properties of natural and synthetic microbial communities. but also provide key knowledge required for engineering them. In this article. we provide an overview of mathematical tools that include not only current mainstream approaches. but also less traditional approaches that. in our opinion. can be potentially useful. We discuss a broad range of methods ranging from low-resolution supra-organismal to high-resolution individual-based modeling. Particularly. we highlight the integrative approaches that synergistically combine disparate methods.

The results indicate that an elevated pKa of 6.5 associated with the chemical step is due to the formation of the enol tautomer of the substrate's pterin ring. The tautomer is induced to form as a result of substrate binding. in which the substrate desolvates the active site and binds to the carboxylate of Asp 27. Although the binding reaction is favorable. burial of the negative charge on Asp 27 is not. Protonation of Asp 27 occurs. concerted with tautomerization of the substrate. resulting in active site electrical neutrality and activation of the substrate for catalysis.

In fact. the electrostatic calculations and complementary quantum chemical calculations indicate that Asp27 is likely protonated when methotrexate is bound. resulting in a neutral dipole-dipole interaction rather than a salt-bridge between the …,True,AlrLiSQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283697911736,8263074563442578561,/scholar?cites=8263074563442578561,,http://garrison.chem.psu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/17285/2014/09/164bjg.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,We demonstrate here the use of natural isotopic ‘labels’ in peptides to aid in the identification of peptides with a de novo algorithm. Using data from ion trap tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of 102 tryptic peptides. we have analyzed multiple series of peaks within LCQ MS/MS spectra that ‘spell’ peptide sequences. Isotopic peaks from naturally abundant isotopes are particularly prominent even after peak centroiding on y‐ and b‐series ions and lead to increased confidence in the identification of the precursor peptides. Sequence analysis of the MS/MS data is accomplished by finding sequences and subsequences in a hierarchical manner within the spectra. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons.

Automatic de novo peptide identification from collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry data is made difficult by large plateaus in the fitness landscapes of scoring functions and the fuzzy nature of the constraints that is due to noise in the data. A framework is presented for combining different peptide identification methods within a parallel genetic algorithm. The distinctive feature of our approach. based on Pareto ranking. is that it can accommodate constraints and possibly conflicting scoring functions.

Current approaches use either kinetic simulations. which are difficult to extend to large networks of reactions because of the need for rate constants. or flux-based methods. which have a large number of feasible solutions because they are unconstrained by the law of mass action. This report presents an alternative modeling approach based on statistical thermodynamics. The principles of this approach are demonstrated using a simple set of coupled reactions. and then the system is characterized with respect to the changes in energy. entropy. free energy. and entropy production. Finally. the physical and biochemical insights that this approach can provide for metabolism are demonstrated by application to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of Escherichia coli. The reaction and pathway thermodynamics are evaluated and predictions are made regarding changes in concentration of TCA cycle intermediates due to 10- and 100-fold changes in the ratio of NAD+:NADH concentrations.

This review article discusses recent developments in the availability of peptidoglycan biosynthetic intermediates. the identification of lead compounds for both the earlier cytoplasmic steps and the later lipid-linked steps. and the application of new methods such as structure-based drug design. phage display and surface …,True,fo9CYkkAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,231,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167779910002179,12120070764945188060,/scholar?cites=12120070764945188060,,,0,0,0

They share a common enzyme mechanism. although they show a preference for different substrates. There is no apparent sequence homology between the enzymes. To investigate the molecular mechanism and the basis for their substrate specificity. we have determined the crystal structures of the two enzymes at high resolution. 4-OT is hexameric. with the subunits arranged with 32 symmetry. CHMI is trimeric and has extensive contacts between subunits. which include secondary structural elements. The central core of the CHMI monomer has a fold similar to a 4-OT dimer. but the secondary structural elements that form the subunit contacts around the 3-fold axis are different in the two enzymes.

Previous studies of the structure of type III AFP by NMR and X-ray identified a remarkably flat surface on the protein containing amino acids that were demonstrated to be important for interaction with ice by mutational studies.

Sensing of pH has been proposed as a sufficient proxy for determination of PCO2 and direct CO2-sensing largely discounted. Here we show that connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels. causally linked to respiratory chemosensitivity. are directly modulated by CO2. A ‘carbamylation motif’. present in CO2-sensitive connexins (Cx26. Cx30. Cx32) but absent from a CO2-insensitive connexin (Cx31). comprises Lys125 and four further amino acids that orient Lys125 towards Arg104 of the adjacent subunit of the connexin hexamer. Introducing the carbamylation motif into Cx31 created a mutant hemichannel (mCx31) that was opened by increases in PCO2. Mutation of the carbamylation motif in Cx26 and mCx31 destroyed CO2 sensitivity. Course-grained computational modelling of Cx26 demonstrated that the proposed carbamate bridge between Lys125 and Arg104 biases the hemichannel to the open state.

FtsZ assembles into a ring (the Z-ring) on the inner surface of the inner membrane at the site of cell division. The Z-ring then acts as a recruitment site for at least ten other proteins which form the division apparatus. One of these proteins. ZapA. acts to enhance lateral associations between FtsZ fibres to form bundles. Previously we have expressed. purified and crystallized ZapA and demonstrated that it exists as a tetramer.

The first enzyme in this pathway. Glu-tRNA reductase (GluTR) catalyzes the reduction of glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) (Glu-tRNA) to glutamate 1-semialdehyde (GSA) with the release of the uncharged tRNA(Glu). The second enzyme. GSA-2.1-aminomutase. converts GSA to ALA. tRNA(Glu) is a specific cofactor for the NADPH-dependent reduction by GluTR. an enzyme that recognizes the tRNA in a sequence-specific manner.

Indeed. it has been suggested that organisms resembling brucellae have been detected in carbonized cheese from the Roman era (Capasso 2002). These observations highlight how both man and animals have lived with this disease since the days of early record keeping. Despite the numerous biotechnological improvements we now have. brucellosis remains a major worldwide zoonosis. Some countries have been successful in eradication of disease. while others. especially in the developing world still live with a huge disease burden.

Natural abundance 13C NMR spectroscopy studies revealed only proline as a major organic osmoticum in cells grown in defined medium (no exogenous organic solutes) and this finding was confirmed by amino acid analysis. Intracellular concentrations of both K+ and proline rose markedly after osmotic upshock. K+ influx from the medium was rapid (< 1 h) but proline synthesis was a slower process (5–9 h). Proline synthesis appeared to be dependent on the prior accumulation of K+ and it is possible that K+ serves in some manner as the signal for increased proline synthesis. In cells upshocked in medium enriched in glycine betaine the endogenous synthesis of proline was repressed and glycine betaine served as the sole organic osmoticum.

Despite the identification of a number of distinct species within the genus with differing host preferences and pathogenicity it has been known for many years that members of the genus are genetically homogeneous. However. since the start of the millennium the application of new technologies to the group has resulted in rapid advances in the understanding of Brucella diversity and. after many years of inactivity. a process of expansion of the genus is underway.

Application of the Boyle-van't Hoflf relationship (cell volume versus reciprocal of external osmolality) permitted direct determination of turgor pressure. which was approximately 0·75 osmol kg−1 (1·9 MPa) in exponentially growing bacteria in a defined medium. The abolition of turgor pressure immediately after upshock and the subsequent recovery of turgor were investigated. Recovery of turgor was K+ dependent.

1226158,Characterisation of the genetic diversity of Brucella by multilocus sequencing,2007,Adrian M Whatmore and Lorraine L Perrett and Alastair P MacMillan,7,BMC microbiology,1,1-15,BioMed Central,Brucella species include economically important zoonotic pathogens that can infect a wide range of animals. There are currently six classically recognised species of Brucella although. as yet unnamed. isolates from various marine mammal species have been reported. In order to investigate genetic relationships within the group and identify potential diagnostic markers we have sequenced multiple genetic loci from a large sample of Brucella isolates representing the known diversity of the genus. Nine discrete genomic loci corresponding to 4.396 bp of sequence were examined from 160 Brucella isolates. By assigning each distinct allele at a locus an arbitrary numerical designation the population was found to represent 27 distinct sequence types (STs). Diversity at each locus ranged from 1.03–2.45% while overall genetic diversity equated to 1.5%. Most loci examined represent housekeeping gene loci and. in all but one case. the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous change was substantially <1. Analysis of linkage equilibrium between loci indicated a strongly clonal overall population structure. Concatenated sequence data were used to construct an unrooted neighbour-joining tree representing the relationships between STs. This shows that four previously characterized classical Brucella species. B. abortus. B. melitensis. B. ovis and B. neotomae correspond to well-separated clusters. With the exception of biovar 5. B. suis isolates cluster together. although they form a more diverse group than other classical species with a number of distinct STs corresponding to the remaining four biovars.

Consequently. nef is of considerable interest in both antiviral drug and vaccine development. Preliminary findings in two rhesus macaques indicated that a deletion of only 12 bp found in the overlapping nef/39 long terminal repeat (LTR) region (9501 to 9512) of the SIVmacC8 molecular clone was associated with reduced virus isolation frequency. We show that this deletion can be repaired in vivo by a sequence duplication event and that sequence evolution continues until the predicted amino acid sequence of the repair is virtually indistinguishable from that of the virulent wild type.

S. suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America. but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans and pigs are poorly understood.  Methodology/Principal Findings The sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage: one from European pigs. and two from human cases from China and Vietnam. Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available. Accordingly. ∼40% of the ∼2 Mb genome is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation; virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The only exceptions are three ∼90 kb regions. present in the two isolates from humans. composed of integrative conjugative elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences associated with drug resistance. In addition. small-scale sequence variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization factors.

Lower Austria. two gram-negative. oxidase- and urease-positive. coccoid rod-shaped bacteria (strains 257 and 284) were isolated. Cells were fast growing. nonmotile. and agglutinated with monospecific anti-Brucella (M) serum. Both strains were biochemically identified as Ochrobactrum anthropi by using the API 20NE test.

Since the extent of hybridization between a pair of strains is ultimately governed by their respective genomic sequences. we examined the quantitative relationship between DDH values and genome sequence-derived parameters. such as the average nucleotide identity (ANI) of common genes and the percentage of conserved DNA. A total of 124 DDH values were determined for 28 strains for which genome sequences were available.

This polyphasic taxonomy takes into account all available phenotypic and genotypic data and integrates them in a consensus type of classification. framed in a general phylogeny derived from 16S rRNA sequence analysis. In some cases. the consensus classification is a compromise containing a minimum of contradictions. It is thought that the more parameters that will become available in the future. the more polyphasic classification will gain stability.

Moulin. A. Munive. B. Dreyfus. and C. Boivin-Masson.

However. strains common to both the natural environment and patients with cystic fibrosis have not yet been described. By use of various genotyping methods. we have identified from agricultural soil the B cepacia genomovar III strain that is most frequently recovered from cystic fibrosis patients in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA. This finding indicates that human pathogenic strains are not necessarily distinct from environmental strains. and might help explain ongoing human acquisition despite strict infection control measures.,True,d17Lk4AAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,195,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673602088360,16778864818461600648,/scholar?cites=16778864818461600648,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tom_Coenye/publication/11297652_An_epidemic_Burkholderia_cepacia_complex_strain_identified_in_soil/links/5be3f0ca299bf1124fc30254/An-epidemic-Burkholderia-cepacia-complex-strain-identified-in-soil.pdf,0,0,0
1226227,Compression for venous leg ulcers,2012,Susan O'Meara and Nicky Cullum and E Andrea Nelson and Jo C Dumville,,,11,,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,BackgroundUp to one percent of people in industrialised countries will suffer from a leg ulcer at some time. The majority of these leg ulcers are due to problems in the veins. resulting in an accumulation of blood in the legs. Leg ulcers arising from venous problems are called venous (or varicose or stasis) ulcers. The main treatment is the application of a firm compression garment (bandage or stocking) in order to aid venous return. There is a large number of compression garments available and it was unclear whether they are effective in treating venous ulcers and. if so. which method of compression is the most effective.ObjectivesTo undertake a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects on venous ulcer healing of compression bandages and stockings.,True,Bydb28AAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,1436,https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000265.pub3/abstract,1107305679166833295,/scholar?cites=1107305679166833295,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc7068175/,0,0,0

Sonography and CT were both highly sensitive (92% and 100%. respectively) and specific (96% and 100%. respectively). Hepatobiliary scintigraphy was compromised by frequent false-positives; the result was a specificity of only 38%. Percutaneous bile aspiration was insufficiently sensitive (33%) for diagnosis.

Methods  Design  A pragmatic. randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an economic evaluation.  Setting  Community. district nurse-led services; community leg ulcer clinics; hospital leg ulcer clinics with community outreach. A range of urban and rural settings in England and Scotland.   Subjects  Patients were eligible to participate in the trial if they presented with a venous leg ulcer of at least 1-week’s duration. at least 1 cm in length or width and an ankle:brachial pressure index of at least 0.8.  Interventions  The four-layer bandage (4LB) (which is multilayer elastic compression) compared with the short-stretch bandage (SSB) (multilayer. inelastic compression).  Main outcome measures  The primary end-point was complete healing of all the ulcers on the trial leg. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients healed at 12 and 24 weeks. rate of recurrence. costs of leg ulcer treatment and quality of life.  Results  A total of 387 people were recruited to the trial between April 1999 and December 2000; this represents 39% (387/988) of those approached. Patients ranged in age from 23 to 97 years at trial entry. with a mean age of 71 years. Most frequent reasons for exclusion from the trial were patients not suitable for compression. ankle/brachial pressure index lower than 0.8. diabetes mellitus and maximum ulcer <1 cm.

Although their presence is a prerequisite for subsequent infections. viruses and bacteria may be present in the nasopharynx without causing any respiratory symptoms. The upper respiratory tract hosts a vast range of commensals and potential pathogenic bacteria. which form a complex microbial community. This community is assumed to be constantly subject to synergistic and competitive interspecies interactions. Disturbances in the equilibrium. for instance due to the acquisition of new bacteria or viruses. may lead to overgrowth and invasion. A better understanding of the dynamics between commensals and pathogens in the upper respiratory tract may provide better insight into the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases. Here we review the current knowledge regarding specific bacterial–bacterial and viral–bacterial interactions that occur in the upper respiratory niche. and discuss mechanisms by which these interactions might be mediated. Finally. we propose a theoretical model to summarize and illustrate these mechanisms.,True,jWkd6PsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,492,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003057,2263495590161031731,/scholar?cites=2263495590161031731,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003057,0,0,0

Further. intranasal immunization by live pneumococcal colonization or by a killed. nonencapsulated whole-cell vaccine protected antibody-deficient mice against colonization. suggesting independence of antibodies to any pneumococcal antigens.

The nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence of particular serotypes is relatively stable worldwide. but the host and bacterial factors that maintain these patterns are poorly understood. Given the possibility of serotype replacement following vaccination against seven clinically important serotypes. it is increasingly important to understand these factors. We hypothesized that the biochemical structure of the capsular polysaccharides could influence the degree of encapsulation of different serotypes. their susceptibility to killing by neutrophils. and ultimately their success during nasopharyngeal carriage. We sought to measure biological differences among capsular serotypes that may account for epidemiological patterns. Using an in vitro assay with both isogenic capsule-switch variants and clinical carriage isolates. we found an association between increased carriage prevalence and resistance to non-opsonic neutrophil-mediated killing. and serotypes that were resistant to neutrophil-mediated killing tended to be more heavily encapsulated. as determined by FITC-dextran exclusion. Next. we identified a link between polysaccharide structure and carriage prevalence. Significantly. non-vaccine serotypes that have become common in vaccinated populations tend to be those with fewer carbons per repeat unit and low energy expended per repeat unit. suggesting a novel biological principle to explain patterns of serotype replacement. More prevalent serotypes are more heavily encapsulated and more resistant to neutrophil-mediated killing. and these phenotypes are associated with the …,True,jWkd6PsAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,315,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000476,15193130346471344059,/scholar?cites=15193130346471344059,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000476,0,0,0

A case in point is the displacement of Staphylococcus aureus by Streptococcus pneumoniae in the nasopharynx. which is of considerable clinical significance. How it is accomplished. however. has been a great mystery. because H2O2 is a very well known disinfectant whose lethality is largely due to the production of hyperoxides through the abiological Fenton reaction. In this report. we have solved the mystery by showing that H2O2 at the concentrations typically produced by pneumococci kills lysogenic but not nonlysogenic staphylococci by inducing the SOS response.

Background DNA from chemicals and consumables. extraction biases as well as differences in PCR efficiency can significantly interfere with microbiota assessment. This study was aiming to establish protocols for accurate microbiota analysis at low microbial density.   Methods To examine possible effects of bacterial density on microbiota analyses we compared microbiota profiles of serial diluted saliva and low (nares. nasopharynx) and high-density (oropharynx) upper airway communities in four healthy individuals. DNA was extracted with four different extraction methods (Epicentre Masterpure. Qiagen DNeasy. Mobio Powersoil and a phenol bead-beating protocol combined with Agowa-Mag-mini). Bacterial DNA recovery was analysed by 16S qPCR and microbiota profiles through GS-FLX-Titanium-Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons spanning the V5–V7 regions.

We investigated S. pneumoniae carriage in saliva from fifty schoolchildren by conventional and molecular methods. Saliva was first culture-enriched for pneumococci. after which. DNA was extracted from all bacterial growth and tested by quantitative-PCR (qPCR) for pneumococcus-specific genes lytA and piaA. Next. serotype composition of the samples was determined by serotype-specific qPCRs. conventional-PCRs (cPCR) and sequencing of cPCR amplicons. Although only 2 (4%) of 50 samples were positive by conventional diagnostic culture. 44 (88%) were positive for pneumococci by qPCR. In total. we detected the presence of at least 81 pneumococcal strains representing 20 serotypes in samples from 44 carriers with 23 carriers (52%) positive for multiple (up to 6) serotypes. The number of serotypes detected per sample correlated with pneumococcal abundance. This study shows that saliva could be used as a tool for future pneumococcal surveillance studies. Furthermore. high rates of pneumococcal carriage and co-carriage of multiple pneumococcal strains together with a large number of serotypes in circulation suggests a ubiquitous presence of S. pneumoniae in saliva of school-aged children.

The function of the eyelids and production of tears help to protect the eye. However the warm. moist. enclosed environment. which exists between the surface of the eye (conjunctiva) and the eyelids. also provides an environment in which contaminating bacteria can establish an infection. The number of organisms responsible for infection of the eye is relatively small. nevertheless the consequences are always potentially serious as the eye may become irreversibly damaged.

S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available. Accordingly. ∼40% of the ∼2 Mb genome is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation; virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The only exceptions are three ∼90 kb regions. present in the two isolates from humans. composed of integrative conjugative elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences associated with drug resistance. In addition. small-scale sequence variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization factors.

Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) is a host-restricted pathogen of horses that has evolved from the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus). These pathogens share approximately 80% genome sequence identity with the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. We sequenced and compared the genomes of S. equi 4047 and S. zooepidemicus H70 and screened S. equi and S. zooepidemicus strains from around the world to uncover evidence of the genetic events that have shaped the evolution of the S. equi genome and led to its emergence as a host-restricted pathogen. Our analysis provides evidence of functional loss due to mutation and deletion. coupled with pathogenic specialization through the acquisition of bacteriophage encoding a phospholipase A2 toxin. and four superantigens. and an integrative conjugative element carrying a novel iron acquisition system with similarity to the high pathogenicity island of Yersinia pestis. We also highlight that S. equi. S. zooepidemicus. and S. pyogenes share a common phage pool that enhances cross-species pathogen evolution. We conclude that the complex interplay of functional loss. pathogenic specialization. and genetic exchange between S. equi. S. zooepidemicus. and S. pyogenes continues to influence the evolution of these important streptococci.,True,UI1XJzgAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,212,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000346,3168912606727295621,/scholar?cites=3168912606727295621,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000346,0,0,0

They are also currently poorly understood. Here. we report on the application of sophisticated experimental approaches to map spatiotemporal population dynamics of bacteria during an infection. We analyzed heterogeneous traits of simultaneous infections with tagged Salmonella enterica populations (wild-type isogenic tagged strains [WITS]) in wild-type and gene-targeted mice. WITS are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished and enumerated by quantitative PCR. making it possible. using probabilistic models. to estimate bacterial death rate based on the disappearance of strains through time. This multidisciplinary approach allowed us to establish the timing. relative occurrence. and immune control of key infection parameters in a true host–pathogen combination. Our analyses support a model in which shortly after infection. concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs. a process controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later. decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally. with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs via bacteraemia and further stochastic selection. This approach provides us with an unprecedented outlook on the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections. illustrating the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease.

S. bongori and S. enterica. Compared to the well-studied S. enterica there is a marked lack of information regarding the genetic makeup and diversity of S. bongori. S. bongori has been found predominantly associated with cold-blooded animals. but it can infect humans. To define the phylogeny of this species. and compare it to S. enterica. we have sequenced 28 isolates representing most of the known diversity of S. bongori. This cross-species analysis allowed us to confidently differentiate ancestral functions from those acquired following speciation. which include both metabolic and virulence-associated capacities. We show that. although S. bongori inherited a basic set of Salmonella common virulence functions. it has subsequently elaborated on this in a different direction to S. enterica. It is an established feature of S. enterica evolution that the acquisition of the type III secretion systems (T3SS-1 and T3SS-2) has been followed by the sequential acquisition of genes encoding secreted targets. termed effectors proteins. We show that this is also true of S. bongori. which has acquired an array of novel effector proteins (sboA-L). All but two of these effectors have no significant S. enterica homologues and instead are highly similar to those found in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Remarkably. SboH is found to be a chimeric effector protein. encoded by a fusion of the T3SS-1 effector gene sopA and a gene highly similar to the EPEC effector nleH from enteropathogenic E. coli.

The mlstdbNet software enables the implementation of distributed web-accessible MLST databases that can be linked widely over the Internet. The software enables multiple isolate databases to query a single profiles database that contains allelic profile and sequence definitions. This separation enables isolate databases to be established by individual laboratories. each customised to the needs of the particular project and with appropriate access restrictions. while maintaining the benefits of a single definitive source of profile and sequence information. Databases are described by an XML file that is parsed by a Perl CGI script. The software offers a large number of ways to query the databases and to further break down and export the results generated. Additional features can be enabled by installing third-party (freely available) tools.

The genomes of 44 diverse strains of S. pneumoniae were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the Mitis group. Despite evidence of extensive recombination. the S. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. With the exception of serotype 1. the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype. geographical site of isolation and disease outcome. The distribution of dispensable genes - genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains - was consistent with phylogeny. although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. Homologous recombination. involving short stretches of DNA. was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of S. pneumoniae. Genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species. and S. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of S. pneumoniae. The pan-genome size of S. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes. suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones.

The toxin can interfere with the functioning of both cellular and soluble components of the human immune system which protects against penumococcal infection. Different amino acids within the toxin which are important in promoting oligomerization of the toxin in membranes and for the generation of functional lesions have been identified by site‐directed mutagenesis. Pneumolysin can also activate the classical pathway of complement. and this appears to involve antibody binding (via Fc) by a region of the toxin homologous to C‐reactive protein. a human acute‐phase protein also capable of classical pathway activation and implicated in host defence against pneumococcal infection.,True,Z7Ryb6oAAAAJ:tS2w5q8j5-wC,173,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2958.1991.tb01969.x,11512038544433702234,/scholar?cites=11512038544433702234,,https://www.academia.edu/download/61628646/j.1365-2958.1991.tb01969.x20191228-20477-kb6nj8.pdf,0,0,0

Simply. it is the application of valid. relevant. and research-based information in nurse decision-making. Used effectively. evidence-based nursing methods can be used to dramatically enhance patient care and improve outcomes. Evidence-based Nursing is a practical guide to evidence-based nursing for students and practitioners. Proceeding step-by-step. it enables nurses to understand and evaluate the different types of evidence that are available. and to critically appraise the studies that lay behind them. It also considers the ways in which these findings can be implemented in clinical practice. and how research can be practically applied to clinical-decision making. Easy to use step-by-step approach Explores all aspects of the evidence-based nursing process Includes updates of popular articles from Evidence-based Nursing Examines dissemination and implementation of research findings in clinical practice Includes clinical scenarios Chapters include learning exercises to aid understanding Evidence-based Nursing is a vital resource for students and practitioners wanting to learn more about research based nursing methods.,True,HNfJMl0AAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,183,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=r6Agr-tk8UAC&oi=fnd&pg=PT11&dq=info:dteOt2DtyjAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=tcn_9AupEv&sig=6ADSrrynGsrz8oZHGuTKVpTVuAk,3515883458768328566,/scholar?cites=3515883458768328566,,,0,0,0
1226430,Methods for identifying surgical wound infection after discharge from hospital: a systematic review,2006,Emily S Petherick and Jane E Dalton and Peter J Moore and Nicky Cullum,6,,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Wound infections are a common complication of surgery that add significantly to the morbidity of patients and costs of treatment. The global trend towards reducing length of hospital stay post-surgery and the increase in day case surgery means that surgical site infections (SSI) will increasingly occur after hospital discharge. Surveillance of SSIs is important because rates of SSI are viewed as a measure of hospital performance. however accurate detection of SSIs post-hospital discharge is not straightforward. We conducted a systematic review of methods of post discharge surveillance for surgical wound infection and undertook a national audit of methods of post-discharge surveillance for surgical site infection currently used within United Kingdom NHS Trusts. Seven reports of six comparative studies which examined the validity of post-discharge surveillance methods were located; these involved different comparisons and some had methodological limitations. making it difficult to identify an optimal method. Several studies evaluated automated screening of electronic records and found this to be a useful strategy for the identification of SSIs that occurred post discharge. The audit identified a wide range of relevant post-discharge surveillance programmes in England. Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland; however. these programmes used varying approaches for which there is little supporting evidence of validity and/or reliability. In order to establish robust methods of surveillance for those surgical site infections that occur post discharge. there is a need to develop a method of case ascertainment that is valid and reliable post discharge …,True,HNfJMl0AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,181,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-6-170?report=reader,7255335102606772332,/scholar?cites=7255335102606772332,,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-6-170?report=reader,0,0,0

Although the four-layer bandage (4LB) is regarded as the gold standard compression system. it is recognised that the amount of compression delivered might be compromised by poor application technique. Also the bulky nature of the bandages might reduce ankle or leg mobility and make the wearing of shoes difficult. Two-layer compression hosiery systems are now available for the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Two-layer hosiery (HH) may be advantageous. as it has reduced bulk. which might enhance ankle or leg mobility and patient adherence. Some patients can also remove and reapply two-layer hosiery. which may encourage self-management and could reduce costs.

Ltd,BackgroundVenous leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg which can be slow to heal. and are both painful and costly. The point prevalence of open venous leg ulcers in the UK is about 3 cases per 10.000 people. and many people experience recurrent episodes of prolonged ulceration. First‐line treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy. but a wide range of dressings and topical treatments are also used.

A trial of NPWT for the treatment of grade III/IV pressure ulcers would be worthwhile but premature without assessing whether such a trial is feasible. The aim of this pilot randomised controlled trial was to assess the feasibility of conducting a future full trial of NPWT for the treatment of grade III and IV pressure ulcers and to pilot all aspects of the trial. This was a two-centre (acute and community). pilot randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants were randomised to receive either NPWT or standard care (SC) (spun hydrocolloid. alginate or foam dressings). Outcome measures were time to healing of the reference pressure ulcer. recruitment rates. frequency of treatment visits. resources used and duration of follow-up. Three hundred and twelve patients were screened for eligibility into this trial over a 12-month recruitment period and 12/312 participants (3.8%) were randomised: 6 to NPWT and 6 to SC. Only one reference pressure ulcer healed (NPWT group) during follow-up (time to healing 79 days).

Flaviviridae family is composed of fast evolving RNA viruses that infects vertebrate (mammals and birds) and/or invertebrate (ticks and mosquitoes) organisms. These host groups are very distinct life forms separated by a long evolutionary time. so lineage-specific anti-viral mechanisms are likely to have evolved. Flaviviridae viruses which infect a single host lineage would be subjected to specific host-induced pressures and. therefore. selected by them. In this work we compare the genomic evolutionary patterns of Flaviviridae viruses and their hosts in an attempt to uncover coevolutionary processes inducing common features in such disparate groups. Especially. we have analyzed dinucleotide and codon usage patterns in the coding regions of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms as well as in Flaviviridae viruses which specifically infect one or both host types. The two host groups possess very distinctive dinucleotide and codon usage patterns. A pronounced CpG under-representation was found in the vertebrate group. possibly induced by the methylation-deamination process. as well as a prominent TpA decrease. The invertebrate group displayed only a TpA frequency reduction bias. Flaviviridae viruses mimicked host nucleotide motif usage in a host-specific manner.

1226478,Up-to-date insight on industrial enzymes applications and global market,2012,Boutros Sarrouh and Tulio Marcos Santos and Anderson Miyoshi and R Dias and V Azevedo,4,J Bioprocess Biotech,,002,,Industrial and household catalysis becomes more and more dependent on enzymes. This is not surprising since enzymes are able to catalyze all kinds of chemical reactions. They can perform conversions in minutes or even seconds. which would take hundreds of years without their interference [1. 2]. Furthermore. they catalyze reactions. which are difficult to perform by chemical methods. like the enantio-or regioselective hydrolysis or addition of chiral groups. Since all of these features are generally displayed at room temperature under mostly aqueous conditions the research towards the use of biocatalysts is mainly driven by the necessity of using sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals (green routes) and complex active ingredients in a pharmaceutical and agrobiological context [2. 3].This ‘‘white biotechnology’’remains a challenge since new biocatalytic processes have to compete economically with the well-established chemical processes that have been optimized for years [2]. Although many complicated chemical reactions can be efficiently performed by biocatalysts. industrial conditions are usually different from those in nature with respect to substrate concentrations. sheering forces. temperature and organic solvents. Therefore. most enzymes found in soil and water may display the desired activity. but are generally not suited for industrial use [2. 4]. Furthermore. for numerous industrial chemical processes an adequate enzyme cannot be readily found in nature. implying that there is a need for novel biocatalysts. Enzymes with the desired activity under industrial conditions can be obtained by optimizing process conditions …,True,IadP2xIAAAAJ:mknn8xuUkmsC,125,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tulio_Santos/publication/259821714_Up-To-Date_Insight_on_Industrial_Enzymes_Applications_and_Global_Market/links/0a85e52e0042812e1d000000/Up-To-Date-Insight-on-Industrial-Enzymes-Applications-and-Global-Market.pdf,5051292022921083817,/scholar?cites=5051292022921083817,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tulio_Santos/publication/259821714_Up-To-Date_Insight_on_Industrial_Enzymes_Applications_and_Global_Market/links/0a85e52e0042812e1d000000/Up-To-Date-Insight-on-Industrial-Enzymes-Applications-and-Global-Market.pdf,0,0,0

CL mainly affects small ruminants. such as goats and sheep; it also causes infections in humans. though rarely. This species is distributed worldwide. but it has the most serious economic impact in Oceania. Africa and South America. Although C. pseudotuberculosis causes major health and productivity problems for livestock. little is known about the molecular basis of its pathogenicity.   Methodology and Findings We characterized two C. pseudotuberculosis genomes (Cp1002. isolated from goats; and CpC231. isolated from sheep). Analysis of the predicted genomes showed high similarity in genomic architecture. gene content and genetic order. When C. pseudotuberculosis was compared with other Corynebacterium species. it became evident that this pathogenic species has lost numerous genes. resulting in one of the smallest genomes in the genus. Other differences that could be part of the adaptation to pathogenicity include a lower GC content. of about 52%. and a reduced gene repertoire. The C. pseudotuberculosis genome also includes seven putative pathogenicity islands. which contain several classical virulence factors. including genes for fimbrial subunits. adhesion factors. iron uptake and secreted toxins. Additionally. all of the virulence factors in the islands have characteristics that indicate horizontal transfer.

This shift in doctrine. among other things. requires the Army to review its training and development to meet the new demands. US Army Engineers have a major role in stability operations. The new doctrine requires engineers to conduct numerous technical tasks in support of stability operations. While these technical skills are not necessarily new to the Regiment. they have not been emphasized in the recent past. The education. training. and development of technical skills were second to the tactical engineering skills required of the Regiment.

In addition to the long-known healthcare-associated clones. novel strains have also emerged outside of the hospital settings. in the community as well as in livestock. The emergence and spread of virulent clones expressing Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) is an additional cause for concern. In order to provide an overview of pandemic. epidemic and sporadic strains. more than 3.000 clinical and veterinary isolates of MRSA mainly from Germany. the United Kingdom. Ireland. France. Malta. Abu Dhabi. Hong Kong. Australia. Trinidad & Tobago as well as some reference strains from the United States have been genotyped by DNA microarray analysis. This technique allowed the assignment of the MRSA isolates to 34 distinct lineages which can be clearly defined based on non-mobile genes. The results were in accordance with data from multilocus sequence typing. More than 100 different strains were distinguished based on affiliation to these lineages. SCCmec type and the presence or absence of PVL. These strains are described here mainly with regard to clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance- and virulence-associated markers. but also in relation to epidemiology and geographic distribution. The findings of the study show a high level of biodiversity among MRSA. especially among strains harbouring SCCmec IV and V elements. The data also indicate a high rate of genetic recombination in MRSA involving SCC elements. bacteriophages or other mobile genetic elements and large-scale chromosomal replacements.,True,hdzTWZcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,711,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017936,13521069740928433801,/scholar?cites=13521069740928433801,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017936,0,0,0

MLST data confirm the data from previous studies that suggest that P. aeruginosa is best described as nonclonal but as having an epidemic population. The index of association was 0.17. indicating a freely recombining population; however. there was evidence of clusters of closely related strains or clonal complexes among the members of this population. It is apparent that the sequence types (STs) from single isolates. representing each of the present epidemic clones in the United Kingdom from Liverpool. Manchester. and the West Midlands. are not closely related to each other. This suggests distinct evolutionary origins for each of these epidemic clones in the United Kingdom.

S. aureus α-toxin should be tried first when pores of 1–1.5 nm diameter are required. This is generally the case when Ca2+ and nucleotide dependence of a given process is being studied. If α-toxin does not work. this is probably due to the fact that the toxin either does not produce pores. or that the pores are too small. In this case. high concentrations of α-toxin should be tried. If this still does not work. we recommend the use of HlyA. When very large pores are to be created. e.g. for introduction of antibodies into the cells.

The toxin forms hexamers in the target cell membranes. and rapid transmembrane flux of K+. Na+. and 86Rb+ is observed.

E. faecalis has a great potential to spread virulence as well as antibiotic resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer. The integration of food-borne enterococci into the oral biofilm in-vivo has been observed. Therefore we investigated the virulence determinants and antibiotic resistance of 97 E. faecalis isolates from the oral cavity. food and clinical specimens. In addition. phenotypic expression of gelatinase and cytolysin were tested. in-vitro biofilm formation was quantified and isolates were compared for strain relatedness via pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Each isolate was found to possess two or more virulence genes. most frequently gelE. efaA and asa1. Notably. plaque/saliva isolates possessed the highest abundance of virulence genes. the highest levels of phenotypic gelatinase and hemolysin activity and concurrently a high ability to form biofilm. The presence of asa1 was associated with biofilm formation. The biofilm formation capacity of clinical and plaque/saliva isolates was considerably higher than that of food isolates and they also showed similar antibiotic resistance patterns.

Besides its known cytotoxic activities against granulocytes. monocytes. endothelial cells. and renal epithelial cells. we now demonstrate that the toxin potently kills human T lymphocytes. Evidence based on different and independent approaches indicates that lymphocidal activity is due to formation of transmembrane pores. Additionally. cells prestimulated with phytohemagglutinin respond to low doses of E. coli hemolysin with DNA fragmentation similar to that observed in cells undergoing programmed cell death.

Here we show that a moderate concentration (1-50 μg/ml) of α-toxin similarly produces a small pore in membranes of human fibroblasts. This process leads to rapid leakage of K+ and to a drop in cellular ATP to 10-20% of normal levels in 2 h.

Research into EPEC is intense and provides a good virulence model of other E. coli infections as well as other pathogenic bacteria. Although the virulence mechanisms are now better understood. they are extremely complex and much remains to be learnt. The pathogenesis of EPEC depends on the formation of an ultrastructural lesion in which the bacteria make intimate contact with the host apical enterocyte membrane. The formation of this lesion is a consequence of the ability of EPEC to adhere in a localized manner to the host cell. aided by bundle-forming pili. Tyrosine phosphorylation and signal transduction events occur within the host cell at the lesion site. leading to a disruption of the host cell mechanisms and. consequently. to diarrhea.

S. suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America. but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans and pigs are poorly understood.  Methodology/Principal Findings The sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage: one from European pigs. and two from human cases from China and Vietnam. Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available. Accordingly. ∼40% of the ∼2 Mb genome is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation; virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The only exceptions are three ∼90 kb regions. present in the two isolates from humans. composed of integrative conjugative elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences associated with drug resistance. In addition. small-scale sequence variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization factors.

LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein kinase containing a central catalytic core and a number of protein-protein interaction domains. An important step forward in the understanding of both the biology and the pathology of LRRK2 would be achieved by identification of its authentic physiological substrates. In the present study we examined phosphorylation of 4E-BP (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein). a recently proposed substrate for LRRKs. We found that LRRK2 is capable of phosphorylating 4E-BP in vitro. The PD related LRRK2-G2019S mutant was ∼2 fold more active than wild type protein. However. LRRK2 autophosphorylation was stronger than 4E-BP phosphorylation under conditions of molar excess of 4E-BP to LRRK2. We also tested three other kinases (STK3. MAPK14/p38α and DAPK2) and found that MAPK14/p38α could efficiently phosphorylate 4E-BP at the same site as LRRK2 in vitro. Finally. we did not see changes in 4E-BP phosphorylation levels using inducible expression of LRRK2 in HEK cell lines. We also found that MAPK14/p38α phosphorylates 4E-BP in transient overexpression experiments whereas LRRK2 did not. We suggest that increased 4E-BP phosphorylation reported in some systems may be related to p38-mediated cell stress rather than direct LRRK2 activity.

GTPase and multiple protein-protein interaction domains. but only mutations in LRRK2 are linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Independent studies suggest that LRRK2 exists in the cell as a complex compatible with the size of a dimer. However. whether this complex is truly a homodimer or a heterologous complex formed by monomeric LRRK2 with other proteins has not been definitively proven due to the limitations in obtaining highly pure proteins suitable for structural characterization. Here. we used stable expression of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in HEK293T cell lines to produce recombinant LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins of greater than 90% purity. Both purified LRRKs are folded. with a predominantly alpha-helical secondary structure and are capable of binding GTP with similar affinity. Furthermore. recombinant LRRK2 exhibits robust autophosphorylation activity. phosphorylation of model peptides in vitro and ATP binding. In contrast. LRRK1 does not display significant autophosphorylation activity and fails to phosphorylate LRRK2 model substrates. although it does bind ATP. Using these biochemically validated proteins. we show that LRRK1 and LRRK2 are capable of forming homodimers as shown by single-particle transmission electron microscopy and immunogold labeling.

LRRK2 is a complex protein that consists of multiple domains executing several functions. including GTP hydrolysis. kinase activity and protein binding. Robust evidence suggests that LRRK2 acts at the synaptic site as a molecular hub connecting synaptic vesicles to cytoskeletal elements via a complex panel of protein-protein interactions. Here we investigated the impact of pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity on synaptic function. Acute treatment with LRRK2 inhibitors reduced the frequency of spontaneous currents. the rate of synaptic vesicle trafficking and the release of neurotransmitter from isolated synaptosomes. The investigation of complementary models lacking LRRK2 expression allowed us to exclude potential off-side effects of kinase inhibitors on synaptic functions. Next we studied whether kinase inhibition affects LRRK2 heterologous interactions. We found that the binding among LRRK2. presynaptic proteins and synaptic vesicles is affected by kinase inhibition.

In animal models. an increase of DHA content in the brain induces α-synuclein oligomer formation in vivo. However. it is not clear whether these oligomeric species are the precursors of the larger aggregates found in Lewy bodies of post-mortem PD brains. To characterize these species and to define the role of fatty acids in amyloid formation. we investigated the aggregation process of α-synuclein in the presence of DHA.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). a kinase mutated in autosomal dominantly inherited and sporadic PD cases. is highly expressed in immune cells. in which it regulates inflammation through a yet unclear mechanism. Here. using pharmacological inhibition and cultured Lrrk2                                                           −/−                             primary microglia cells. we validated LRRK2 as a positive modulator of inflammation and we investigated its specific function in microglia cells. Inhibition or genetic deletion of LRRK2 causes reduction of interleukin-1β and cyclooxygenase-2 expression upon lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammation. LRRK2 also takes part of the signaling trigged by α-synuclein fibrils. which culminates in induction of inflammatory mediators. At the molecular level. loss of LRRK2 or inhibition of its kinase activity results in increased phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) inhibitory subunit p50 at S337. a protein kinase A (PKA)-specific phosphorylation site. with consequent accumulation of p50 in the nucleus.

Genes responsible for familial PD can be ascribed to two categories based both on their mode of inheritance and their suggested biological function. Mutations in parkin. PINK1 and DJ-1 cause of recessive Parkinsonism. with a variable pathology often lacking the characteristic Lewy bodies (LBs) in the surviving neurons. Intriguingly. recent findings highlight a converging role of all these genes in mitochondria function. suggesting a common molecular pathway for recessive Parkinsonism. Mutations in a second group of genes. encoding alpha-synuclein (α-syn) and LRRK2. are transmitted in a dominant fashion and generally lead to LB pathology. with α-syn being the major component of these proteinaceous aggregates. In experimental systems. overexpression of mutant proteins is toxic. as predicted for dominant mutations. but the normal function of both proteins is still elusive. The fact that α-syn is heavily phosphorylated in LBs and that LRRK2 is a protein kinase. suggests that a link. not necessarily direct. exists between the two. What are the experimental data supporting a common molecular pathway for dominant PD genes? Do α-syn and LRRK2 target common molecules? Does LRRK2 act upstream of α-syn?

We have previously observed that LRRK2 interacts with NSF. a hexameric AAA+ ATPase that couples ATP hydrolysis to the disassembling of SNARE proteins allowing them to enter another fusion cycle during synaptic exocytosis. Here. we demonstrate that NSF is a substrate of LRRK2 kinase activity. LRRK2 phosphorylates full-length NSF at threonine 645 in the ATP binding pocket of D2 domain. Functionally. NSF phosphorylated by LRRK2 displays enhanced ATPase activity and increased rate of SNARE complex disassembling. Substitution of threonine 645 with alanine abrogates LRRK2-mediated increased ATPase activity.

We present a set of integrated experiments that investigate the effects of common genetic variability on DNA methylation and mRNA expression in four human brain regions each from 150 individuals (600 samples total). We find an abundance of genetic cis regulation of mRNA expression and show for the first time abundant quantitative trait loci for DNA CpG methylation across the genome. We show peak enrichment for cis expression QTLs to be approximately 68.000 bp away from individual transcription start sites; however. the peak enrichment for cis CpG methylation QTLs is located much closer. only 45 bp from the CpG site in question. We observe that the largest magnitude quantitative trait loci occur across distinct brain tissues. Our analyses reveal that CpG methylation quantitative trait loci are more likely to occur for CpG sites outside of islands. Lastly. we show that while we can observe individual QTLs that appear to affect both the level of a transcript and a physically close CpG methylation site. these are quite rare.

D2 receptor binding was measured by autoradiography in the caudate. putamen and nucleus accumbens. using the specific D2 receptor ligand [3H]-raclopride. In a sample of 44 individuals. only one was homozygous for the A1 allele. 25 were homozygous for A2 and 18 were heterozygotes. The presence of one or two A1 alleles was associated with reduced D2 receptor binding in all areas of the striatum. reaching statistical significance in the ventral caudate and putamen (p= 0.01 and p= 0.044. respectively). This reduction was more marked in males than females. particularly in the putamen.

Despite extensive efforts to determine the mechanism of cell death in patients with LRRK2 mutations. the aetiology of LRRK2 PD is not well understood. To examine possible alterations in gene expression linked to the presence of LRRK2 mutations. we carried out a case versus control analysis of global gene expression in three systems: fibroblasts isolated from LRRK2 mutation carriers and healthy. non-mutation carrying controls; brain tissue from G2019S mutation carriers and controls; and HEK293 inducible LRRK2 wild type and mutant cell lines. No significant alteration in gene expression was found in these systems following correction for multiple testing. These data suggest that any alterations in basal gene expression in fibroblasts or cell lines containing mutations in LRRK2 are likely to be quantitatively small. This work suggests that LRRK2 is unlikely to play a direct role in modulation of gene expression. although it remains possible that this protein can influence mRNA expression under pathogenic cicumstances.,True,CgPvvbAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,33,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022489,9957151136910477859,/scholar?cites=9957151136910477859,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0022489,0,0,0

1226718,Parkinson’s Disease: The Catabolic Theory,2013,Claudia Manzoni,,,,,,UK Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most studied neurodegenerative disorders. In the majority of cases. PD shows no obvious genetic cause and it is classified as idiopathic or sporadic disease. This does not mean that there is no genetic involvement; in fact. genome wide association studies (GWAs) have highlighted the existence of multiple risk loci all over the genome able to increase an individual’s propensity to develop sporadic PD. In light of this. sporadic cases may be considered the result of a predisposed genotype stimulated by the correct environmental exposure.As for many other neurodegenerative disorders. there is a small but significant minority of PD cases that display classical. Mendelian patterns of inheritance (familial PD. fPD) caused by genetic mutations in single loci that. despite variable degrees of penetrance. segregate with the disease. In addition to fPD genes. there is also a host of mutations in genes associated with parkinsonism. a clinical syndrome that is not classified as pure PD despite some overlaps in terms of clinical and/or pathological presentation.,True,CgPvvbAAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1468820/1/neuroscience-1-1009.pdf,,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1468820/1/neuroscience-1-1009.pdf,0,0,0

We observe that the largest magnitude quantitative trait loci occur across distinct brain tissues.

What is clear is that point mutations or increased expression of wild type α-synuclein causes disease. A great deal of literature supports the overall hypothesis that α-synuclein is damaging to neurons because it is inherently prone to aggregation; mutations or increased concentration of the protein both increase this tendency. An unproven. but popular. contention is that the toxic species are small oligomers that are relatively soluble. which may react with membranes to damage key processes within the cell.

Previous studies have shown that PINK1 influences both mitochondrial function and morphology although it is not clearly established which of these are primary events and which are secondary. Here. we describe a novel mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in mitochondrial morphology related to PINK1. Cell lines were generated by stably transducing human dopaminergic M17 cells with lentiviral constructs that increased or knocked down PINK1. As in previous studies. PINK1 deficient cells have lower mitochondrial membrane potential and are more sensitive to the toxic effects of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We also show that wild-type PINK1. but not recessive mutant or kinase dead versions. protects against rotenone-induced mitochondrial fragmentation whereas PINK1 deficient cells show lower mitochondrial connectivity. Expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) exaggerates PINK1 deficiency phenotypes and Drp1 RNAi rescues them. We also show that Drp1 is dephosphorylated in PINK1 deficient cells due to activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Accordingly. the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocks both Drp1 dephosphorylation and loss of mitochondrial integrity in PINK1 deficient cells but does not fully rescue mitochondrial membrane potential. We propose that alterations in mitochondrial connectivity in this system are secondary to functional effects on mitochondrial membrane potential.,True,UMlVFBwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,194,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005701,13471135993802516496,/scholar?cites=13471135993802516496,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005701,0,0,0

While these proteins behave similarly to prions. recent evidence suggests the existence of fundamental differences. as they can propagate in the absence of endogenous template. they do not exhibit a strict ‘strain’ behavior. and they may not be transmissible between individuals. We therefore propose to name these proteins ‘prionoids’.

The frequency is rare; affecting around 1 in 20.000 people. where most of the cases are sporadic. approximately 20–30% of patients may have a positive family history. thus indicating a possible genetic contribution in the aetiology of blepharospasm [1]. A recent study examined the genetic influences in blepharospasm based on the examination of patients and their firstdegree relatives and found a very high proportion of probands (27%) with at least one first-degree relative affected by some form of focal dystonia [1]. Polymorphisms of the genes encoding TOR1A and D5 dopamine receptor (DRD5) have been associated with an increased lifetime risk of focal dystonia and these genes were investigated in two independent cohorts of Italian and North American patients with blepharospasm [2]. While no association was identified. analysis of the Italian group separately revealed an association with the same TOR1A risk haplotype as previously described in an Icelandic population.

PINK1 is a putative kinase associated with mitochondria. and loss of PINK1 expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. which increases with time. Parkin is suggested to be downstream of PINK1 and also mediates the removal of damaged mitochondria by macroautophagy (mitophagy). We investigated whether mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells following decreased PINK1 expression by RNAi may in part be due to the inhibition of mitophagy.

Human DJ-1. a protein associated with inherited parkinsonism. readily forms cysteine-sulfinic acid at a conserved cysteine residue (Cys106 in human DJ-1). Mutation of Cys106 causes the protein to lose its normal protective function in cell culture and model organisms. However. it is unknown whether the loss of DJ-1 protective function in these mutants is due to the absence of Cys106 oxidation or the absence of the cysteine residue itself. To address this question. we designed a series of substitutions at a proximal glutamic acid residue (Glu18) in human DJ-1 that alter the oxidative propensity of Cys106 through changes in hydrogen bonding.

Previous studies have shown that PINK1 influences both mitochondrial function and morphology although it is not clearly established which of these are primary events and which are secondary. Here. we describe a novel mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in mitochondrial morphology related to PINK1. Cell lines were generated by stably transducing human dopaminergic M17 cells with lentiviral constructs that increased or knocked down PINK1. As in previous studies. PINK1 deficient cells have lower mitochondrial membrane potential and are more sensitive to the toxic effects of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We also show that wild-type PINK1. but not recessive mutant or kinase dead versions. protects against rotenone-induced mitochondrial fragmentation whereas PINK1 deficient cells show lower mitochondrial connectivity. Expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) exaggerates PINK1 deficiency phenotypes and Drp1 RNAi rescues them. We also show that Drp1 is dephosphorylated in PINK1 deficient cells due to activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Accordingly. the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocks both Drp1 dephosphorylation and loss of mitochondrial integrity in PINK1 deficient cells but does not fully rescue mitochondrial membrane potential.

1226850,Pten-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and its role in mitochondrial function and dynamics,2008,Kelly Jean Thomas,,,,,,Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The majority of PD cases involve the sporadic form with unknown etiology. but mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are considered to play a role in disease pathogenesis. The discoveries of the genes parkin. PINK1 and DJ-1 that are linked to familial forms of parkinsonism have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms that cause disease. Recent findings implicate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oxidative damage as a key molecular mechanism that compromises dopaminergic neurons in familial parkinsonism. Studies within this thesis characterize the mitochondrial function of PINK1 in human neuroblastoma cells. PINK1 prevents cell death mediated by mitochondrial toxins that inhibit complex one of the respiratory chain. which in turn contributes to oxidative stress. PINK1 protects against oxidative stress and secondary mitochondrial dysfunction; therefore. the role of PINK1 in mitochondrial function and morphology was further investigated.,True,HMjebI0AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,0,https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552851,,,,https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/bitstream/handle/10822/552851/thomasKelly.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

IFNγ has been used as an anticancer drug in several clinical studies. unfortunately with modest results.

We show here that targeted delivery of low doses of IFNγ to CD13. a marker of angiogenic vessels. can overcome major counterregulatory mechanisms and delay tumor growth in two murine models that respond poorly to IFNγ. Tumor vascular targeting was achieved by coupling IFNγ to GCNGRC. a CD13 ligand. by genetic engineering technology. The dose-response curve was bell-shaped.

Recent studies have shown that the formation of isoaspartyl residues (isoAsp) in integrin ligands by asparagine deamidation or aspartate isomerization could represent a mechanism for the regulation of integrin–ligand recognition.

In particular. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) has been implicated in a variety of metabolic events including cholesterol homeostasis and atherosclerosis. 25HC is detectable in human plasma after ingestion of a meal rich in oxysterols and following a dietary cholesterol challenge. In addition. the levels of oxysterols. including 25HC. have been found to be elevated in hypercholesterolemic serum.   Methodology/Principal Findings Here. we demonstrate that the estrogen receptor (ER) α mediates gene expression changes and growth responses induced by 25HC in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Moreover. 25HC exhibits the ERα-dependent ability like 17β-estradiol (E2) to inhibit the up-regulation of HIF-1α and connective tissue growth factor by hypoxic conditions in cardiomyocytes and rat heart preparations and to prevent the hypoxia-induced apoptosis.   Conclusions/Significance The estrogen action exerted by 25HC may be considered as an additional factor involved in the progression of breast and ovarian tumors. Moreover. the estrogen-like activity of 25HC elicited in the cardiovascular system may play a role against hypoxic environments.,True,EJjY8yoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,85,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016631,17039223091814599531,/scholar?cites=17039223091814599531,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016631,0,0,0

Recently. the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has been implicated in the estrogenic signaling in diverse tissues. including the cardiovascular system. In this study. we demonstrate that left ventricles of male Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) express higher levels of GPER compared to normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. In addition. we show that the selective GPER agonist G-1 induces negative inotropic and lusitropic effects to a higher extent in isolated and Langendorff perfused hearts of male SHR compared to WKY rats. These cardiotropic effects elicited by G-1 involved the GPER/eNOS transduction signaling. as determined by using the GPER antagonist G15 and the eNOS inhibitor L-NIO. Similarly. the G-1 induced activation of ERK1/2. AKT. GSK3β. c-Jun and eNOS was abrogated by G15. while L-NIO prevented only the eNOS phosphorylation. In hypoxic Langendorff perfused WKY rat heart preparations. we also found an increased expression of GPER along with that of the hypoxic mediator HIF-1α and the fibrotic marker CTGF. Interestingly. G15 and L-NIO prevented the ability of G-1 to down-regulate the expression of both HIF-1α and CTGF. which were found expressed to a higher extent in SHR compared to WKY rat hearts.

1226911,Ways to enhance lymphocyte trafficking into tumors and fitness of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,2013,Matteo Bellone and Arianna Calcinotto,3,,,231,Frontiers,The tumor is a hostile microenvironment for T lymphocytes. Indeed. irregular blood flow and endothelial cell (EC) anergy that characterize most solid tumors hamper leukocyte adhesion. extravasation and infiltration. In addition. hypoxia and reprogramming of energy metabolism within cancer cells transform the tumor mass in a harsh environment that limits survival and effector functions of T cells. regardless of being induced in vivo by vaccination or adoptively transferred. In this review. we will summarize on recent advances in our understanding of the characteristics of tumor associated neoangiogenic vessels as well as of the tumor metabolism that may impact on T cell trafficking and fitness of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In particular. we will focus on how advances in knowledge of the characteristics of tumor ECs have enabled identifying strategies to normalize the tumor vasculature and/or overcome EC anergy. thus increasing leukocyte-vessel wall interactions and lymphocyte infiltration in tumors. We will also focus on drugs acting on cells and their released molecules to transiently render the tumor microenvironment more suitable for tumor infiltrating T lymphocytes. thus increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of both active and adoptive immunotherapies.,True,zZZswoAAAAAJ:abG-DnoFyZgC,108,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2013.00231/full?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Pharmacology-w42-2013,14588572387711777600,/scholar?cites=14588572387711777600,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2013.00231/full?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Pharmacology-w42-2013,0,0,0

Yet. the interplay between iNKT and tumor-specific T cells in cancer immune surveillance/editing has never been addressed. The transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) is a realistic model of spontaneous oncogenesis. in which the tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response undergoes full tolerance upon disease progression.  Principal Findings We report here that lack of iNKT cells in TRAMP mice resulted in the appearance of more precocious and aggressive tumors that significantly reduced animal survival. TRAMP mice bearing or lacking iNKT cells responded similarly to a tumor-specific vaccination and developed tolerance to a tumor-associated antigen at comparable rate.

Antigen MZ2-E appears to be presented by HLA-A1; anti-MZ2-E CTLs of the original patient recognized two melanoma cell lines of other HLA-A1 patients that expressed the gene. Thus. precisely targeted immunotherapy directed against antigen MZ2-E could be provided to individuals identified by HLA typing and analysis of the RNA of a small tumor sample.,True,C5AfcUkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4229,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/254/5038/1643.abstract,2714474734324004834,/scholar?cites=2714474734324004834,,,0,0,0

The immune system’s ability to distinguish between self and non-self and between innocuous and harmful foreign antigens is controlled by mechanisms of central and peripheral tolerance. Central tolerance is a well established mechanism that involves deletion of selfreactive T cells upon interaction with bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DCs) in the thymus (1. 2). Well characterized mechanisms of peripheral tolerance include the induction of cell death or the development of a state of nonresponsiveness (anergy) of T cells (3. 4).

The TAA. i.e.. MAGE-3. was acquired by DCs and presented to immune effectors. thanks to the property of DCs to uptake the apoptotic bodies released by the irradiated vector-producing cells. Indeed. we observed that upon irradiation vector-producing cells underwent apoptotic cell death. monitored by annexin V and propidium iodide staining. and were phagocytosed by DCs. Lymphocytes obtained from a patient affected by a MAGE-3+ melanoma. were stimulated in vitro with autologous DCs previously exposed to irradiated MAGE-3-expressing cells.

The Ags encoded by MAGE genes and recognized by T cells are therefore strictly tumor-specific. Clinical trials involving therapeutic vaccination of cancer patients with MAGE antigenic peptides or proteins are in progress. To increase the range of patients eligible for therapy with peptides. it is important to identify additional MAGE epitopes recognized by CTL. Candidate peptides known to bind to a given HLA have been used to stimulate T lymphocytes in vitro. In some instances. CTL clones directed against these synthetic peptides have been obtained. but these clones often failed to recognize tumor cells expressing the relevant gene.

Inc.,The infusion of donor lymphocytes after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a promising therapeutic tool for achieving a graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect in case of leukemic relapse (1–7). and for the treatment of other complications related to the severe immunosuppressive status of transplanted patients. such as Epstein Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-BLPD) (8) or reactivation of CMV infection (9). Although the delay in the administration of T lymphocytes is expected to reduce the risk of severe GvHD. this risk is still present at higher doses of donor T-cells. The transfer of a suicide gene into donor lymphocytes could allow the in vivo selective elimination of cells responsible for severe GvHD. Additionally. under appropriate conditions. it may allow in vivo modulation of donor anti-tumor responses. and to separate GvL from GvHD.

This is counterbalanced by detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Induction of a selective suicide in donor T cells is a current gene therapy approach to abrogate GVHD. Unfortunately. genetic modification reduces alloreactivity of lymphocytes. This associates with an effector memory (TEM) phenotype of gene-modified lymphocytes and may limit antileukemia effect. We hypothesized that alloreactivity of gene-modified lymphocytes segregates with the central memory (TCM) phenotype.

Superantigen stimulation of T lymphocytes depends on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. so there has been some debate as to whether superantigens interact with the antigen binding “groove” on class II complexes. just like conventional peptide antigens. or whether they bind elsewhere and serve as TCR coligands. We compared the presentation of peptide antigens and superantigens by a panel of mutant-presenting cell lines. each displaying an Akα chain with a single alanine replacement along the α helix proposed to form one face of the groove.

The function of Numb has been linked to its ability to bind and to biologically antagonize Notch. a membrane receptor that also specifies cell fate. The biochemical mechanisms underlying the action of Numb. however. are still largely unknown. The wide pattern of expression of Numb suggests a general function in cellular homeostasis that could be additional to. or part of. its action in fate determination. Such a function could be endocytosis. as suggested by the interaction of Numb with Eps15. a component of the endocytic machinery. Here. we demonstrate that Numb is an endocytic protein.

A highly vascularized lesion. KS is frequently associated with AIDS. indicating HIV products may be involved.

Cell-free secreted products (KS-CM) from cultured epidemic and sporadic KS spindle cells or recombinant (r) HIV-1 tat protein were injected into mice with a matrix support (Matrigel). RESULTS: KS-CM produced lesions carrying all the phenotypic hallmarks of KS. as observed by light and electron microscopy: spindle-shaped cells. haemorrhages and an inflammatory infiltrate. as well as Factor VIII-positive endothelial cells lining new blood vessels. Electron microscopy indicated an initial granulocyte invasion. with spindle-cell migration and neocapillary formation in the centre of the matrix. These lesions required the cofactor heparin; KS-CM or heparin alone were poorly angiogenic. A less intense angiogenesis. with lower cellularity and few granulocytes. was observed in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)/heparin lesions. indicating that factors other than bFGF are present in the KS spindle-cell products.

Here. we report that TTP (SH3BP4). a SH3-containing protein. specifically regulates the internalization of the transferrin receptor (TfR). TTP interacts with endocytic proteins. including clathrin. dynamin. and the TfR. and localizes selectively to TfR-containing coated-pits (CCP) and -vesicles (CCV). Overexpression of TTP specifically inhibits TfR internalization. and causes the formation of morphologically aberrant CCP. which are probably fission impaired. This effect is mediated by the SH3 of TTP. which can bind to dynamin. and it is rescued by overexpression of dynamin.

A complex cross-talk between tumor cells and the stroma exists with reciprocal influence that dictates tumor progression and ultimately the clinical outcome.

As A. hydrophila possesses an N‐acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)‐dependent quorum‐sensing system based on the ahyRI locus. the presence of the AhyI protein and C4‐HSL within the biofilm phase was first established by Western blot and AHL biosensor analysis respectively. The ability of the A. hydrophila AH‐1 N strain to form biofilms in a continuous‐flow chamber was compared with isogenic ahyI and ahyR mutants. The ahyI mutant. which cannot produce C4‐HSL. failed to form a mature biofilm.

This is due. in part. to enhanced catecholamine-induced cAMP-PKA signaling in FOXC2 transgenic mice. Here we show that rolipram treatment of adipocytes from FOXC2 transgenic mice did not increase isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation to the same extent as in wild type cells. Accordingly. phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) activity was reduced by 75% and PDE4A5 protein expression reduced by 30–50% in FOXC2 transgenic WAT compared to wild type.

This interaction is required for the integration of IGF-I Receptor and adhesion signaling. Here we investigated the nature of the binding site for PP2A and β1 integrin in RACK1. A WD7 deletion mutant of RACK1 did not associate with PP2A but retained some interaction with β1 integrin. whereas a WD6/WD7 mutant lost the ability to bind to both PP2A and β1 integrin. Using immobilized peptide arrays representing the entire RACK1 protein. we identified a common cluster of amino acids (FAGY) at positions 299-302 within WD7 of RACK1 which were essential for binding of both PP2A and β1 integrin to RACK1. PP2A showed a higher level of association with a peptide in which Y302 was phosphorylated compared with an unphosphorylated peptide. whereas β1 integrin binding was not affected by phosphorylation. RACK1 mutants in which either the FAGY cluster or Y302 were mutated to AAAF. or F. respectively. did not interact with either PP2A or β1 integrin. These mutants were unable to rescue the decrease in PP2A activity caused by suppression of RACK1 in MCF-7 cells with siRNA. MCF-7 cells and R+ cells (IGF-IR over-expressing fibroblasts) expressing these mutants exhibited decreased proliferation and migration. whereas R-cells (IGF-IR null fibroblasts) were unaffected.

The only way to inactivate cAMP is to degrade it through the action of cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs are thus poised to play a key regulatory role. PDE4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases appear to have specific functions with selective inhibitors serving as potent anti-inflammatory agents. The recent elucidation of the structure of the PDE4 catalytic unit allows for molecular insight into the mode of catalysis as well as substrate and inhibitor selectivity. The four PDE4 genes encode over 16 isoforms. each of which is characterized by a unique N-terminal region.

A multifaceted scaffolding protein: Structure and function,2011,David R Adams and Dorit Ron and Patrick A Kiely,9,,1,22,BioMed Central,The Receptor for Activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) is a member of the tryptophan-aspartate repeat (WD-repeat) family of proteins and shares significant homology to the β subunit of G-proteins (Gβ). RACK1 adopts a seven-bladed β-propeller structure which facilitates protein binding. RACK1 has a significant role to play in shuttling proteins around the cell. anchoring proteins at particular locations and in stabilising protein activity. It interacts with the ribosomal machinery. with several cell surface receptors and with proteins in the nucleus. As a result. RACK1 is a key mediator of various pathways and contributes to numerous aspects of cellular function. Here. we discuss RACK1 gene and structure and its role in specific signaling pathways. and address how posttranslational modifications facilitate subcellular location and translocation of RACK1.

1227145,Phosphorylation of RACK1 on tyrosine 52 by c-Abl is required for insulin-like growth factor I-mediated regulation of focal adhesion kinase,2009,Patrick A Kiely and George S Baillie and Robert Barrett and Deirdre A Buckley and David R Adams and Miles D Houslay and Rosemary O'Connor,284,Journal of Biological Chemistry,30,20263-20274,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) activity is controlled by growth factors and adhesion signals in tumor cells. The scaffolding protein RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinases) integrates insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and integrin signaling. but whether RACK1 is required for FAK function is unknown. Here we show that association of FAK with RACK1 is required for both FAK phos pho ryl a tion and dephos pho ryl a tion in response to IGF-I. Suppression of RACK1 by small interfering RNA ablates FAK phos pho ryl a tion and reduces cell adhesion. cell spreading. and clonogenic growth.

The anti-opiate neuropeptides FF and AF (NPFF and NPAF) have been implicated in pain modulation as well as in opioid tolerance and may play a critical role in this process. although their mechanism of action has remained unknown. Here we describe a cDNA encoding a novel neuropeptide Y-like human orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). referred to as HLWAR77 for which NPAF and NPFF have high affinity.

Here we show that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors can couple to an alternative signaling pathway. When expressed in Rat-1 cells. stimulation of the alpha 2A receptor. which couples to Gi2 and Gi3. causes rapid. transient activation of the protooncogene product p21ras as measured by an increase in the amount of bound GTP. Furthermore. alpha 2A receptor stimulation causes rapid phosphorylation of the p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase.

Structural changes in synaptic connectivity have been proposed as a substrate of memory storage. Here. we examine the impact of brief periods of sleep deprivation on dendritic structure. In mice. we find that five hours of sleep deprivation decreases dendritic spine numbers selectively in hippocampal area CA1 and increased activity of the filamentous actin severing protein cofilin. Recovery sleep normalizes these structural alterations. Suppression of cofilin function prevents spine loss. deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. and impairments in long-term memory caused by sleep deprivation. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 (PDE4A5). which hampers cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling. Attenuating PDE4A5 function prevents changes in cAMP-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling and cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation.

This article reviews the current knowledge and our new findings about the striatal cholinoceptive organization and its role in a variety of cognitive functions. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations have indicated that the cholinergic and dopaminergic system in the striatum modulate each other's function. In addition to modulating the dopaminergic system. nicotinic cholinergic receptors facilitate GABA release. whereas muscarinic receptors attenuate GABA release. The striatal cholinergic system has also been implicated in various cognitive functions including procedural learning and intradimensional set shifting.

In this review. we highlight recent studies showing that sleep deprivation impairs hippocampal cAMP and mTOR signaling. and ultimately causes spine loss in CA1 neurons in a cofilin-dependent fashion.

One means of achieving spatial specificity is to restrict signaling molecules to particular subcellular compartments using anchoring molecules such as A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). Disruption of protein kinase A (PKA) anchoring to AKAPs impairs a PKA-dependent form of long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. To investigate the role of localized PKA signaling in LTP. we developed a stochastic reaction-diffusion model of the signaling pathways leading to PKA activation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Simulations investigated whether the role of anchoring is to locate kinases near molecules that activate them. or near their target molecules. The results show that anchoring PKA with adenylyl cyclase (which produces cAMP that activates PKA) produces significantly greater PKA activity. and phosphorylation of both inhibitor-1 and AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit on S845. than when PKA is anchored apart from adenylyl cyclase. The spatial microdomain of cAMP was smaller than that of PKA suggesting that anchoring PKA near its source of cAMP is critical because inactivation by phosphodiesterase limits diffusion of cAMP. The prediction that the role of anchoring is to colocalize PKA near adenylyl cyclase was confirmed by experimentally rescuing the deficit in LTP produced by disruption of PKA anchoring using phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

Cell migration is required for axonal guidance and neurite outgrowth and involves a series of highly co-ordinated and overlapping signalling pathways. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) has an essential role in development and is the most highly expressed kinase in the developing CNS. FAK activity is essential for neuronal cell adhesion and migration. The objective of this study was to optimise a protocol for the differentiation of the neuroblastoma cell line. SH-SY5Y. We determined the optimal extracellular matrix proteins and growth factor combinations required for the optimal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into neuronal-like cells and determined those conditions that induce the expression of FAK. It was confirmed that the cells were morphologically and biochemically differentiated when compared to undifferentiated cells. This is in direct contrast to commonly used differentiation methods that induce morphological differentiation but not biochemical differentiation. We conclude that we have optimised a protocol for the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells that results in a cell population that is both morphologically and biochemically distinct from undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells and has a distinct adhesion and spreading pattern and display extensive neurite outgrowth.

It consists of a catalytic subunit (C). a structural subunit (A). and a regulatory/variable B-type subunit. PP2A has a critical role to play in homeostasis where its predominant function is as a phosphatase that regulates the major cell signaling pathways in cells. Changes in the assembly. activity and substrate specificity of the PP2A holoenzyme have a direct role in disease and are a major contributor to the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in cancer. We have learned a lot about how PP2A functions from specific mutations that disrupt the core assembly of PP2A and from viral proteins that target PP2A and inhibit its effect as a phosphatase. This prompted various studies revealing that restoration of PP2A activity benefits some cancer patients. However. our understanding of the mechanism of action of this is limited because of the complex nature of PP2A holoenzyme assembly and because it acts through a wide variety of signaling pathways. Information on PP2A is also conflicting as there are situations whereby inactivation of PP2A induces apoptosis in many cancer cells. In this review we discuss this relationship and we also address many of the pertinent and topical questions that relate to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at altering PP2A activity.

In human pregnancy. PSGs are secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast. a fetal tissue. and reach a concentration of up to 400 ug/ml in the maternal bloodstream at term. Human and mouse PSGs induce release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGFβ1 from monocytes. macrophages. and other cell types. suggesting an immunoregulatory function. RGD tri-peptide motifs in the majority of human PSGs suggest that they may function like snake venom disintegrins. which bind integrins and inhibit interactions with ligands. We noted that human PSG1 has a KGD. rather than an RGD motif. The presence of a KGD in barbourin. a platelet integrin αIIbβ3 antagonist found in snake venom. suggested that PSG1 may be a selective αIIbβ3 ligand. Here we show that human PSG1 binds αIIbβ3 and inhibits the platelet – fibrinogen interaction. Unexpectedly. however. the KGD is not critical as multiple PSG1 domains independently bind and inhibit αIIbβ3 function. Human PSG9 and mouse Psg23 are also inhibitory suggesting conservation of this function across primate and rodent PSG families. Our results suggest that in species with haemochorial placentation. in which maternal blood is in direct contact with fetal trophoblast. the high expression level of PSGs reflects a requirement to antagonise abundant (3 mg/ml) fibrinogen in the maternal circulation. which may be necessary to prevent platelet aggregation and thrombosis in the prothrombotic maternal environment of pregnancy.,True,xRkFVB4AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057491,14056298012307700530,/scholar?cites=14056298012307700530,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0057491,0,0,0

Here we show that cell cycle phosphorylation of the prototypical DDR mediator Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad9 depends on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes. We find that a specific G2/M form of Cdc28 can phosphorylate in vitro the N-terminal region of Rad9 on nine consensus CDK phosphorylation sites. We show that the integrity of CDK consensus sites and the activity of Cdc28 are required for both the activation of the Chk1 checkpoint kinase and its interaction with Rad9. We have identified T125 and T143 as important residues in Rad9 for this Rad9/Chk1 interaction. Phosphorylation of T143 is the most important feature promoting Rad9/Chk1 interaction. while the much more abundant phosphorylation of the neighbouring T125 residue impedes the Rad9/Chk1 interaction. We suggest a novel model for Chk1 activation where Cdc28 regulates the constitutive interaction of Rad9 and Chk1.

A large body of evidence is accumulating which is helping to define the versatile role of RACK1 in assembling and dismantling complex signaling pathways from the cell membrane to the nucleus in health and disease. In this commentary. we first provide a historical perspective on RACK1. We also address many of the pertinent and topical questions about this protein such as its role in transcription. epigenetics and translation. its cytoskeletal contribution and the merits of targeting RACK1 in disease.,True,xRkFVB4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,33,https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-811X-11-53,2759827181239252385,/scholar?cites=2759827181239252385,,https://biosignaling.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-811X-11-53,0,0,0

The emerging theme is that RACK1 functions as a signalling switch. recruiting proteins to form distinct molecular complexes. In focal adhesions. RACK1 is required for the regulation of FAK activity and for integrating a wide array of cellular signalling events including the integration of growth factor and adhesion signalling pathways. FAK is required for cell adhesion and migration and has a well-established role in neurite outgrowth and in the developing nervous system. However. the mechanism by which FAK activity is regulated in neurons remains unknown. Using neuronal cell lines. we determined that differentiation of these cells promotes an interaction between the scaffolding protein RACK1 and FAK.

AKAPs are a group of structurally diverse proteins with the common function of binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA and confining the holoenzyme to discrete locations within the cell. This mode of regulation ensures that PKA is exposed to isolated cAMP gradients. which allows for efficient catalytic activation and accurate substrate selection. Several AKAPs coordinate multiple members of signaling cascades. effectively assembling upstream activators and downstream effectors within the same macromolecular complex. Consequently. AKAPs may serve as points of integration for numerous signaling pathways.

Activation was mediated by a JAK-2-dependent pathway coupled to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p70S6 kinase. Activation was not dependent on the ability of growth hormone to stimulate ERK2 or protein kinase C or any effect on transcription. Blockade of activation of murine PDE4A5 ablated the ability of growth hormone to decrease intracellular cAMP levels. Antisense depletion of murine PDE4A5 mimicked the ability of rolipram to enhance the growth hormone-stimulated differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells to adipocytes.

Cyclic AMP is synthesized in VECs in response to endogenous Gs‐coupled receptors and is known to limit cytokine action and reduce endothelial hyperpermeability induced by multiple pro‐inflammatory stimuli.

A universal cost for all sexual traits involves the resources required to create and maintain them. which are consequently unavailable to other life history characters.

They frequently occur between related host species and often rely on the pathogen evolving adaptations that increase their fitness in the novel host species. To investigate genetic changes in novel hosts. we experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus (Drosophila C Virus) in 19 different species of Drosophilidae and deep sequenced the viral genomes. We found a strong pattern of parallel evolution. where viral lineages from the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species. When we compared viruses that had evolved in different host species. we found that parallel genetic changes were more likely to occur if the two host species were closely related. This suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species. This may explain in part why host shifts tend to occur between related species. and may mean that when a new pathogen appears in a given species. closely related species may become vulnerable to the new disease.,True,Rjw2azgAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006951,15817149300267834899,/scholar?cites=15817149300267834899,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006951,0,0,0

Such variation is often interpreted as alternate adaptive strategies: live fast and die young vs. slow and steady. An alternative (yet rarely tested) explanation is that condition‐dependent constraints on allocation cause variation in signalling with age (‘late bloomers’ do not have early investment options). Testing this hypothesis is challenging because resource acquisition and allocation are difficult to measure. and energetic reserves both affect and are affected by reproductive effort.

Infected individuals are expected to increase investment in defence (e.g.. by increasing immune function) and. due to trade‐offs. investment in other traits (e.g.. current reproduction) should decrease. However. the terminal investment hypothesis postulates that decreased lifespan due to infection and the associated reduction in the expectation for future offspring will favour increased investment towards current reproduction.

The first crucial step is to obtain correct elemental compositions. In order to automatically constrain the thousands of possible candidate structures. rules need to be developed to select the most likely and chemically correct molecular formulas. An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: (1) restrictions for the number of elements. (2) LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules. (3) isotopic patterns. (4) hydrogen/carbon ratios. (5) element ratio of nitrogen. oxygen. phosphor. and sulphur versus carbon. (6) element ratio probabilities and (7) presence of trimethylsilylated compounds. Formulas are ranked according to their isotopic patterns and subsequently constrained by presence in public chemical databases. The seven rules were developed on 68.237 existing molecular formulas and were validated in four experiments. First. 432.968 formulas covering five million PubChem database entries were checked for consistency. Only 0.6% of these compounds did not pass all rules.

1227329,Metabolomic database annotations via query of elemental compositions: mass accuracy is insufficient even at less than 1 ppm,2006,Tobias Kind and Oliver Fiehn,7,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Metabolomic studies are targeted at identifying and quantifying all metabolites in a given biological context. Among the tools used for metabolomic research. mass spectrometry is one of the most powerful tools. However. metabolomics by mass spectrometry always reveals a high number of unknown compounds which complicate in depth mechanistic or biochemical understanding. In principle. mass spectrometry can be utilized within strategies of de novo structure elucidation of small molecules. starting with the computation of the elemental composition of an unknown metabolite using accurate masses with errors <5 ppm (parts per million). However even with very high mass accuracy (<1 ppm) many chemically possible formulae are obtained in higher mass regions. In automatic routines an additional orthogonal filter therefore needs to be applied in order to reduce the number of potential elemental compositions. This report demonstrates the necessity of isotope abundance information by mathematical confirmation of the concept. High mass accuracy (<1 ppm) alone is not enough to exclude enough candidates with complex elemental compositions (C. H. N. S. O. P. and potentially F. Cl. Br and Si). Use of isotopic abundance patterns as a single further constraint removes >95% of false candidates. This orthogonal filter can condense several thousand candidates down to only a small number of molecular formulas. Example calculations for 10. 5. 3. 1 and 0.1 ppm mass accuracy are given.

In support of this. we have recently defined novel roles for orphan IPs in regulating membrane trafficking. cytoskeletal organization. gene expression and mRNA export.

Here we present a detailed phylogenomic analysis of five oleaginous Nannochloropsis species (a total of six strains) and one time-series transcriptome dataset for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis on one representative strain. Despite small genome sizes. high coding potential and relative paucity of mobile elements. the genomes feature small cores of ca. 2.700 protein-coding genes and a large pan-genome of >38.000 genes. The six genomes share key oleaginous traits. such as the enrichment of selected lipid biosynthesis genes and certain glycoside hydrolase genes that potentially shift carbon flux from chrysolaminaran to TAG synthesis. The eleven type II diacylglycerol acyltransferase genes (DGAT-2) in every strain. each expressed during TAG synthesis. likely originated from three ancient genomes. including the secondary endosymbiosis host and the engulfed green and red algae. Horizontal gene transfers were inferred in most lipid synthesis nodes with expanded gene doses and many glycoside hydrolase genes.

Previous studies have indicated the general prevalence of adult gingivitis in China to be high. The aim of this study was to characterize in depth the oral microbiota of Chinese adults with or without gingivitis. by defining the microbial phylogenetic diversity and community-structure using highly paralleled pyrosequencing. Six non-smoking Chinese. three with and three without gingivitis (age range 21-39 years. 4 females and 2 males) were enrolled in the present cross-sectional study. Gingival parameters of inflammation and bleeding on probing were characterized by a clinician using the Mazza Gingival Index (MGI). Plaque (sampled separately from four different oral sites) and salivary samples were obtained from each subject. Sequences and relative abundance of the bacterial 16 S rDNA PCR-amplicons were determined via pyrosequencing that produced 400 bp-long reads. The sequence data were analyzed via a computational pipeline customized for human oral microbiome analyses. Furthermore. the relative abundances of selected microbial groups were validated using quantitative PCR.

To date. the ability of the technique to identify single cells in a high-speed flow has been limited by inherent weakness of the spontaneous Raman signal. Here we present an alternative pause-and-sort RACS microfluidic system that combines positive dielectrophoresis (pDEP) for single-cell trap and release with a solenoid-valve-suction-based switch for cell separation. This has allowed the integration of trapping. Raman identification. and automatic separation of individual cells in a high-speed flow. By exerting a periodical pDEP field. single cells were trapped. ordered. and positioned individually to the detection point for Raman measurement.

Probiotics are a potential replacement of antibiotics in animal feed; however. it is not clear whether and how probiotics and antibiotics differ in impact on physiology and microbial ecology of host animals. Host phenotype and fecal microbiota of broilers with either antibiotics or probiotics as feed additive were simultaneously sampled at four time points from birth to slaughter and then compared. Probiotic feeding resulted in a lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) and induced the highest level of immunity response. suggesting greater economic benefits in broiler farming. Probiotic use but not antibiotic use recapitulated the characteristics of age-dependent development of gut microbiota in the control group. The maturation of intestinal microbiota was greatly accelerated by probiotic feeding. yet significantly retarded and eventually delayed by antibiotic feeding. LP-8 stimulated the growth of many intestinal Lactobacillus spp. and led to an altered bacterial correlation network where Lactobacillus spp. are negatively correlated with 14 genera and positively linked with none. yet from the start antibiotic feeding featured a less-organized network where such inter-genera interactions were fewer and weaker. Consistently. microbiota-encoded functions as revealed by metagenome sequencing were highly distinct between the two groups. Thus. “intestinal microbiota maturation index” was proposed to quantitatively compare impact of feed additives on animal microecology.

Here we investigated the cellulolytic microbiome of the yak rumen by using a combination of metagenome-based and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based functional screening approaches. Totally 223 fibrolytic BAC clones were pyrosequenced and 10.070 ORFs were identified. Among them 150 were annotated as the glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes for fibrolytic proteins. and the majority (69%) of them were clustered or linked with genes encoding related functions. Among the 35 fibrolytic contigs of >10 Kb in length. 25 were derived from Bacteroidetes and four from Firmicutes. Coverage analysis indicated that the fibrolytic genes on most Bacteroidetes-contigs were abundantly represented in the metagenomic sequences. and they were frequently linked with genes encoding SusC/SusD-type outer-membrane proteins. GH5. GH9. and GH10 cellulase/hemicellulase genes were predominant. but no GH48 exocellulase gene was found. Most (85%) of the cellulase and hemicellulase proteins possessed a signal peptide; only a few carried carbohydrate-binding modules. and no cellulosomal domains were detected. These findings suggest that the SucC/SucD-involving mechanism. instead of one based on cellulosomes or the free-enzyme system. serves a major role in lignocellulose degradation in yak rumen.

Cham,In this chapter. we review how HDL is generated. remodeled. and catabolized in plasma. We describe key features of the proteins that participate in these processes. emphasizing how mutations in apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) and the other proteins affect HDL metabolism. The biogenesis of HDL initially requires functional interaction of apoA-I with the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and subsequently interactions of the lipidated apoA-I forms with lecithin/cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Mutations in these proteins either prevent or impair the formation and possibly the functionality of HDL. Remodeling and catabolism of HDL is the result of interactions of HDL with cell receptors and other membrane and plasma proteins including hepatic lipase (HL). endothelial lipase (EL). phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). apolipoprotein M (apoM). scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1). the F1 subunit of ATPase (Ecto F1-ATPase). and the cubulin/megalin receptor. Similarly to apoA-I. apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein A-IV were shown to form discrete HDL particles containing these apolipoproteins which may have important but still unexplored functions. Furthermore. several plasma proteins were found associated with HDL and may modulate its biological functions.

ERAP1 has unique properties for an aminopeptidase being able to trim peptides in vitro based on their length and the nature of their C-termini.  Methodology/Principal Findings In an effort to better understand the molecular mechanism that ERAP1 uses to trim peptides. we systematically analyzed the enzyme's substrate preferences using collections of peptide substrates. We discovered strong internal sequence preferences of peptide N-terminus trimming by ERAP1. Preferences were only found for positively charged or hydrophobic residues resulting to trimming rate changes by up to 100 fold for single residue substitutions and more than 40.000 fold for multiple residue substitutions for peptides with identical N-termini. Molecular modelling of ERAP1 revealed a large internal cavity that carries a strong negative electrostatic potential and is large enough to accommodate peptides adjacent to the enzyme's active site. This model can readily account for the strong preference for positively charged side chains.  Conclusions/Significance To our knowledge no other aminopeptidase has been described to have such strong preferences for internal residues so distal to the N-terminus. Overall. our findings indicate that the internal sequence of the peptide can affect its trimming by ERAP1 as much as the peptide's length and C-terminus. We therefore propose that ERAP1 recognizes the full length of its peptide-substrate and …,True,tGR5O_0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,100,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003658,15625078640839828597,/scholar?cites=15625078640839828597,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003658,0,0,0

Cham,In this chapter. we review how HDL is generated. remodeled. and catabolized in plasma. We describe key features of the proteins that participate in these processes. emphasizing how mutations in apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) and the other proteins affect HDL metabolism. The biogenesis of HDL initially requires functional interaction of apoA-I with the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and subsequently interactions of the lipidated apoA-I forms with lecithin/cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Mutations in these proteins either prevent or impair the formation and possibly the functionality of HDL. Remodeling and catabolism of HDL is the result of interactions of HDL with cell receptors and other membrane and plasma proteins including hepatic lipase (HL). endothelial lipase (EL). phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). apolipoprotein M (apoM). scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1). the F1 subunit of ATPase (Ecto F1-ATPase). and the cubulin/megalin receptor. Similarly to apoA-I. apolipoprotein E and apolipoprotein A-IV were shown to form discrete HDL particles containing these apolipoproteins which may have important but still unexplored functions. Furthermore. several plasma proteins were found associated with HDL and may modulate its biological functions.

They prefer to bind to hydrophobic sites with a distinct preference for leucine side chains. Most MPD binding sites involve amino-acid residues in helical or β-sheet structures. MPD binding to proteins is penetrative. leading to displacement of water molecules in grooves and cavities (sometimes ligand-binding and active sites) on the protein surface. This results in a large reduction of solvent-accessible area. which can have significant implications for protein stability.

The sequences of the amorphous domains are evolutionarily conserved and the repetitive domains differ from each other in length by a variety of tandem repeats of subdomains of ~208 bp which are reminiscent of the repetitive nucleosome organization. A typical composition of a subdomain is a cluster of repetitive units. Ua. followed by a cluster of units. Ub.

A Wiley Company,The recognition sites in 70 pairwise protein–protein complexes of known three‐dimensional structure are dissected in a set of surface patches by clustering atoms at the interface. When the interface buries <2000 Å2 of protein surface. the recognition sites usually form a single patch on the surface of each component protein. In contrast. larger interfaces are generally multipatch. with at least one pair of patches that are equivalent in size to a single‐patch interface. Each recognition site. or patch within a site. contains a core made of buried interface atoms. surrounded by a rim of atoms that remain accessible to solvent in the complex. A simple geometric model reproduces the number and distribution of atoms within a patch. The rim is similar in composition to the rest of the protein surface. but the core has a distinctive amino acid composition. which may help in identifying potential protein recognition sites on single …,True,R71twNgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,680,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/prot.10085,4539029219647484951,/scholar?cites=4539029219647484951,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46575498/prot.1008520160617-23836-2qezfm.pdf,0,0,0

Nineteen groups participated in rounds 1 and 2 of CAPRI and submitted blind structure predictions for seven protein–protein complexes based on the known structure of the component proteins. The predictions were compared to the unpublished X‐ray structures of the complexes. We describe here the motivations for launching CAPRI. the rules that we applied to select targets and run the experiment. and some conclusions that can already be drawn.

Specific non-covalent interactions stabilize the structure of macromolecular assemblies. exemplified in this review by oligomeric proteins and the capsids of icosahedral viruses. They also allow proteins to form complexes that have a very wide range of stability and lifetimes and are involved in all cellular processes. We present some of the structure-based computational methods that have been developed to characterize the quaternary structure of oligomeric proteins and other molecular assemblies and analyze the properties of the interfaces between the subunits. We compare the size. the chemical and amino acid compositions and the atomic packing of the subunit interfaces of protein–protein complexes. oligomeric proteins. viral capsids and protein–nucleic acid complexes. These biologically significant interfaces are generally close-packed. whereas the non-specific interfaces between molecules in protein crystals are loosely packed. an observation that gives a structural basis to specific recognition. A distinction is made within each interface between a core that contains buried atoms and a solvent accessible rim. The core and the rim differ in their amino acid composition and their conservation in evolution. and the distinction helps correlating the structural data with the results of site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro studies of self-assembly.,True,R71twNgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,391,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joel_Janin/publication/23277048_Protein-Protein_Interaction_and_Quaternary_Structure/links/54201c850cf203f155c2a852.pdf,13319470421117004019,/scholar?cites=13319470421117004019,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joel_Janin/publication/23277048_Protein-Protein_Interaction_and_Quaternary_Structure/links/54201c850cf203f155c2a852.pdf,0,0,0

Specific non-covalent interactions stabilize the structure of macromolecular assemblies. exemplified in this review by oligomeric proteins and the capsids of icosahedral viruses. They also allow proteins to form complexes that have a very wide range of stability and lifetimes and are involved in all cellular processes. We present some of the structure-based computational methods that have been developed to characterize the quaternary structure of oligomeric proteins and other molecular assemblies and analyze the properties of the interfaces between the subunits. We compare the size. the chemical and amino acid compositions and the atomic packing of the subunit interfaces of protein–protein complexes. oligomeric proteins. viral capsids and protein–nucleic acid complexes. These biologically significant interfaces are generally close-packed. whereas the non-specific interfaces between molecules in protein crystals are loosely packed. an observation that gives a structural basis to specific recognition. A distinction is made within each interface between a core that contains buried atoms and a solvent accessible rim.

A transcript encoding NAC protein. termed SiNAC was identified from a salt stress subtractive cDNA library of S. italica seedling (Puranik et al.. J Plant Physiol 168:280–287. 2011). This single/low copy gene containing four exons and four introns within the genomic-sequence encoded a protein of 462 amino acids. Structural analysis revealed that highly divergent C terminus contains a transmembrane domain. The NAC domain consisted of a twisted antiparallel beta-sheet packing against N terminal alpha helix on one side and a shorter helix on the other side.

Computational docking methods aim at the prediction of complex architecture given detailed structures of its constituents. They are becoming an increasingly important tool in the field of macromolecular assemblies. complementing particularly demanding protein-nucleic acids X ray crystallography and providing means for the refinement and integration of low resolution data coming from rapidly advancing methods such as cryoelectron microscopy. We present a new coarse-grained force field suitable for protein-DNA docking. The force field is an extension of previously developed parameter sets for protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions. The docking is based on potential energy minimization in translational and orientational degrees of freedom of the binding partners. It allows for fast and efficient systematic search for native-like complex geometry without any prior knowledge regarding binding site location. We find that the force field gives very good results for bound docking. The quality of predictions in the case of unbound docking varies. depending on the level of structural deviation from bound geometries. We analyze the role of specific protein-DNA interactions on force field performance. both with respect to complex structure prediction. and the reproduction of experimental binding affinities.

Polymorphic conformation of both the interacting partners is a characteristic feature of such molecular recognition that promotes the assembly. Many RNA binding proteins (RBP) or regions in them are found to be intrinsically disordered. and this property helps them to play a central role in the regulatory processes. Sequence composition and the length of the flexible linkers between RNA binding domains in RBPs are crucial in making significant contacts with its partner RNA. Polymorphic conformations of RBPs can provide thermodynamic advantage to its binding partner while acting as a chaperone.

Understanding of the molecular origin of specificity of gene regulatory complex formation in the context of the whole genome is currently inadequate. A phage transcription factor λ-CI forms repressive multi-protein complexes by binding to multiple binding sites in the genome to regulate the lifecycle of the phage. The protein–protein interaction between two DNA-bound λ-CI molecules is stronger when they are bound to the correct pair of binding sites. suggesting allosteric transmission of recognition of correct DNA sequences to the protein–protein interaction interface. Exploration of conformation and dynamics by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decay and molecular dynamics suggests a change in protein dynamics to be a crucial factor in mediating allostery.

ZnO nanoparticles (size 5–10 nm) with nearly spherical shape have been synthesized using a chemical route.

A characteristic feature of three-length 310-helices is the shifted backbone conformation for the C-terminal residue (φ.ψ angles: −95°.0°). compared to the rest of the helix (−62°.−24°). The deviation can be attributed to the release of electrostatic repulsion between the carbonyl oxygen atoms at the two C-terminal residues and further stabilization (due to a more linear geometry) of an intrahelical hydrogen bond.

1227635,Molecular modeling and characterization of Vibrio cholerae transcription regulator HlyU,2006,Rudra P Saha and Pinak Chakrabarti,6,BMC structural biology,1,1-13,BioMed Central,The SmtB/ArsR family of prokaryotic metal-regulatory transcriptional repressors represses the expression of operons linked to stress-inducing concentrations of heavy metal ions. while derepression results from direct binding of metal ions by these 'metal-sensor' proteins. The HlyU protein from Vibrio cholerae is the positive regulator of haemolysin gene. it also plays important role in the regulation of expression of the virulence genes. Despite the understanding of biochemical properties. its structure and relationship to other protein families remain unknown. We find that HlyU exhibits structural features common to the SmtB/ArsR family of transcriptional repressors. Analysis of the modeled structure of HlyU reveals that it does not have the key metal-sensing residues which are unique to the SmtB/ArsR family of repressors. yet the tertiary structure is very similar to the family members. HlyU is the only member that has a positive control on transcription. while all the other members in the family are repressors. An evolutionary analysis with other SmtB/ArsR family members suggests that during evolution HlyU probably occurred by gene duplication and mutational events that led to the emergence of this protein from ancestral transcriptional repressor by the loss of the metal-binding sites. The study indicates that the same protein family can contain both the positive regulator of transcription and repressors – the exact function being controlled by the absence or the presence of metal-binding sites.,True,mPApXE4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,26,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-6-24,6101290056090693025,/scholar?cites=6101290056090693025,,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-6-24,0,0,0

Here we report the interaction of virstatin with human serum albumin (HSA) using various biophysical methods. The drug binding was monitored using different isomeric forms of HSA (N form ∼pH 7.2. B form ∼pH 9.0 and F form ∼pH 3.5) by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. There is a considerable quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA on binding the drug. The distance (r) between donor (Trp214 in HSA) and acceptor (virstatin). obtained from Forster-type fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). was found to be 3.05 nm. The ITC data revealed that the binding was an enthalpy-driven process and the binding constants Ka for N and B isomers were found to be 6.09×105 M−1 and 4.47×105 M−1. respectively. The conformational changes of HSA due to the interaction with the drug were investigated from circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. For 1∶1 molar ratio of the protein and the drug the far-UV CD spectra showed an increase in α- helicity for all the conformers of HSA. and the protein is stabilized against urea and thermal unfolding. Molecular docking studies revealed possible residues involved in the protein-drug interaction and indicated that virstatin binds to Site I (subdomain IIA). also known as the warfarin binding site.,True,nU8DkkEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,108,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037468,13707428087892644736,/scholar?cites=13707428087892644736,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037468,0,0,0

Ace activates chloride channels stimulating chloride/bicarbonate transport that augments fluid secretion resulting in diarrhea. These channels have been targeted for drug development.

Here we report the modulation of the structure/function of recombinant Ace by small molecule calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) inhibitors. namely CaCCinh-A01. digallic acid (DGA) and tannic acid. Biophysical studies indicate that the unfolding (induced by urea) free energy increases upon binding CaCCinh-A01 and DGA. compared to native Ace. whereas binding of tannic acid destabilizes the protein. Far-UV CD experiments revealed that the α-helical content of Ace-CaCCinh-A01 and Ace-DGA complexes increased relative to Ace.

SARS-CoV (2003). The complex molecular cascade of events related to the viral pathogenicity is triggered by the Spike protein upon interacting with the ACE2 receptor on human lung cells through its receptor binding domain (RBD Spike). One potential therapeutic strategy to combat COVID-19 could thus be limiting the infection by blocking this key interaction. In this current study. we adopt a protein design approach to predict and propose non-virulent structural mimics of the RBD Spike which can potentially serve as its competitive inhibitors in binding to ACE2. The RBD Spike is an independently foldable protein domain. resilient to conformational changes upon mutations and therefore an attractive target for strategic re-design. Interestingly. in spite of displaying an optimal shape fit between their interacting surfaces (attributed to a consequently high mutual affinity). the RBD Spike–ACE2 interaction appears to have a quasi-stable character due to a poor electrostatic match at their interface. Structural analyses of homologous protein complexes reveal that the ACE2 binding site of RBD Spike has an unusually high degree of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues. attributed to key evolutionary changes. making it inherently ‘reaction-prone’.

Turns of various lengths have been studied and characterized starting from three-residue γ-turn to six-residue π-turn. The Schellman motif occurring at the C-terminal end of α-helices is a classical example of hydrogen bonded π-turn involving residues at (i) and (i+5) positions. Hydrogen bonded and non-hydrogen bonded β- and α-turns have been identified previously; likewise. a systematic characterization of π-turns would provide valuable insight into turn structures. An analysis of protein structures indicates that at least 20% of π-turns occur independent of the Schellman motif. The two categories of π-turns. designated as π-HB and SCH. have been further classified on the basis of backbone conformation and both have AAAa as the major class. They differ in the residue usage at position (i+1). the former having a large preference for Pro that is absent in the latter. As in the case of shorter length β- and α-turns. π-turns have also been identified not only on the basis of the existence of hydrogen bond. but also using the distance between terminal Cα-atoms. and this resulted in a comparable number of non-hydrogen-bonded π-turns (π-NHB).

Biomolecular systems are particularly interesting polyatomic systems because of their medical importance. Such systems are characterized by an ensemble of structures (conformational ensemble). by which we want to realize the system in 3N dimensional space (where N is number of atoms present in the system). The free-energy landscape (3N dimensional) is rugged with many local minima (deep and shallow) and pinholes. This ruggedness of free-energy landscape is a crucial bottleneck to quantitatively characterize a system. Therefore. we need efficient methods to sample conformations of the system such that the system can be described with sufficient accuracy. Any typical sampling method designed to obtain free-energy landscape suffer due to the ruggedness of energy landscape. In other words during the course of sampling the system may be trapped in a local minimum or basin. Therefore we need to come out of the basins and get in the basin not once. but many times if we are interested in computing thermodynamic quantities. Fortunately. a whole bunch of techniques have been proposed to overcome local basin problem. one of which is adaptive umbrella sampling (AUS)[1]. Suppose we want to compute an ensemble of configuration related to a physical process. eg binding between two molecules–a process that samples between two extreme scenarios including bound and unbound states.

1227708,Specific Non-Local Interactions Are Not Necessary for Recovering Native Protein Dynamics,2014,Bhaskar Dasgupta and Kota Kasahara and Narutoshi Kamiya and Haruki Nakamura and Akira R Kinjo,9,PloS one,3,e91347,Public Library of Science,The elastic network model (ENM) is a widely used method to study native protein dynamics by normal mode analysis (NMA). In ENM we need information about all pairwise distances. and the distance between contacting atoms is restrained to the native value. Therefore ENM requires O(N2) information to realize its dynamics for a protein consisting of N amino acid residues. To see if (or to what extent) such a large amount of specific structural information is required to realize native protein dynamics. here we introduce a novel model based on only O(N) restraints. This model. named the ‘contact number diffusion’ model (CND). includes specific distance restraints for only local (along the amino acid sequence) atom pairs. and semi-specific non-local restraints imposed on each atom. rather than atom pairs. The semi-specific non-local restraints are defined in terms of the non-local contact numbers of atoms. The CND model exhibits the dynamic characteristics comparable to ENM and more correlated with the explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation than ENM. Moreover. unrealistic surface fluctuations often observed in ENM were suppressed in CND. On the other hand. in some ligand-bound structures CND showed larger fluctuations of buried protein atoms interacting with the ligand compared to ENM. In addition. fluctuations from CND and ENM show comparable correlations with the experimental B-factor. Although there are some indications of the importance of some specific non-local interactions. the semi-specific non-local interactions are mostly sufficient for reproducing the native protein dynamics.,True,KMiPJBMAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091347,,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091347,0,0,0

Surface biofilms have been attributed to be associated with a ubiquitous protein domain present in all branches of bacteria. known as the GGD(/E)EF domain. While the diguanlyate cyclase activities of these proteins are universally established. the role of these proteins as diguanlyate-specific phosphodiesterases in conjunction with a EAL domain has also been reported. The VC0395_0300 protein from V. cholerae which shows biofilm forming abilities also acts as a phosphodiesterase. Interestingly. this GGD(/E)EF protein contains a EAL site in the reverse orientation. We attempted to mutate the GGEEF signature along the sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. The resultant mutants (Sebox5–7) did not show much difference in phosphodiesterase activity in comparison with the wild type protein (Sebox3). indicating the independence of the phosphodiesterase activity of the protein from the GGD(/E)EF domain.

The antibiotic resistance pattern of two principal UTI pathogens. E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in West Bengal. appears in general to be similar to that found in other parts of the Globe. Higher than 50% resistance were observed for broad-spectrum penicillin. Fourth generation cephalosporin and macrolides seems to be the choice of drug in treating UTIs in Eastern India. Furthermore. improved maintenance of infection incident logs is needed in Eastern Indian hospitals in order to facilitate regular surveillance of the occurrence of antibiotic resistance patterns. since such levels continue to change.,True,f11lRY0AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,38,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00463/full,7626350457053008028,/scholar?cites=7626350457053008028,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00463/full,0,0,0

On the basis of 16S rDNA analysis. strain PB88 was identified as Bacillus cereus PB88. It has the potential to remove 82.33 ± 3.24% in synthetic medium. The optimum pH. temperature and dissolved oxygen for the highest denitrification process of the PB88 were 8.0. 30 °C and 5.21 mg/l (150 rpm) respectively. PB88 harbour the genetic sequence of nitrite reductase (nirS) enzyme which is essential to complete aerobic denitrification process.

This is expressed in terms of an appropriate normalized function of time. the so-called efflux function E(t). Under conditions frequently encountered in practice the measured E(t) can be easily related to the forward rate of pore formation if the liposomes/cells are monodisperse in size. In the basic case of a time-independent rate law it turns out that E(t) must be single exponential. Deviations from such a simple functional behavior might be due to a fairly broad distribution of liposome/cell sizes and/or a more complicated pore formation mechanism.

We used molecular dynamics with the Path Exploration with Distance Constraints (PEDC) method to provide new insights into the allosteric mechanism at the atomic level. by simulating the T-to-R transition. The T-state molecule in the absence of ligands was seen to have a natural propensity for dimer rotation. which nevertheless would be hampered by steric hindrance in the “joint” region. The binding of a ligand to the α subunit would prevent such hindrance due to the coupling between this region and the α proximal histidine. and thus facilitate completion of the dimer rotation.

The formulation can be used with even the simple nearest‐neighbor models and it is demonstrated explicitly with the popular 2 × 2 Zimm‐Bragg model [B. H. Zimm and J. K. Bragg (1959) J. Chem. Physics 31. 526–535]. It involves a conceptual dissection of the polypeptide chain into interacting blocks; the behavior of any block with side‐chain interactions is treated then with conventional binding polynomial techniques. This dissection is a manifestation of “nesting.” which is a hierarchical framework for the description of the behavior of complex macromoecules [C. H. Robert. H. Decker. B. Richey. S. J. Gill. and J.

Allosteric mechanism elucidated by docking and molecular dynamics,2010,Mauricio GS Costa and Paulo R Batista and Cláudio S Shida and Charles H Robert and Paulo M Bisch and Pedro G Pascutti,11,,5,1-15,BioMed Central,Cathepsin B (catB) is a promising target for anti-cancer drug design due to its implication in several steps of tumorigenesis. catB activity and inhibition are pH-dependent. making it difficult to identify efficient inhibitor candidates for clinical trials. In addition it is known that heparin binding stabilizes the enzyme in alkaline conditions. However. the molecular mechanism of stabilization is not well understood. indicating the need for more detailed structural and dynamic studies in order to clarify the influence of pH and heparin binding on catB stability. Our pKa calculations of catB titratable residues revealed distinct protonation states under different pH conditions for six key residues. of which four lie in the crucial interdomain interface. This implies changes in the overall charge distribution at the catB surface. as revealed by calculation of the electrostatic potential. We identified two basic surface regions as possible heparin binding sites. which were confirmed by docking calculations. Molecular dynamics (MD) of both apo catB and catB-heparin complexes were performed using protonation states for catB residues corresponding to the relevant acidic or alkaline conditions. The MD of apo catB at pH 5.5 was very stable. and presented the highest number and occupancy of hydrogen bonds within the inter-domain interface. In contrast. under alkaline conditions the enzyme's overall flexibility was increased: interactions between active site residues were lost. helical content decreased. and domain separation was observed as well as high-amplitude motions of the occluding loop – a main target of drug design studies.

The basis for this recommendation was the association of diets high in plant foods (whole-grain cereals and legumes as well as fruits and vegetables) with a lower occurrence of coronary heart disease and cancers of the lung. esophagus. and stomach. The committee pointed out that the biochemical mechanisms responsible for these dietary associations are not fully understood. but could be largely accounted for by the following nutritional characteristics: low saturated (and total) fat and cholesterol content. high complex carbohydrate content. and high content of vitamins A and C.Relatively little attention has been paid to fruits and vegetables as dietary sources of minerals. This is not particularly surprising since the fruit/vegetable food group is rather poor in many minerals.

1227825,Structure. stability and specificity of the binding of ssDNA and ssRNA with proteins,2019,Arumay Pal and Yaakov Levy,15,PLoS computational biology,4,e1006768,Public Library of Science,Recognition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is important for many fundamental cellular functions. A variety of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (ssDBPs) and single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (ssRBPs) have evolved that bind ssDNA and ssRNA. respectively. with varying degree of affinities and specificities to form complexes. Structural studies of these complexes provide key insights into their recognition mechanism. However. computational modeling of the specific recognition process and to predict the structure of the complex is challenging. primarily due to the heterogeneity of their binding energy landscape and the greater flexibility of ssDNA or ssRNA compared with double-stranded nucleic acids. Consequently. considerably fewer computational studies have explored interactions between proteins and single-stranded nucleic acids compared with protein interactions with double-stranded nucleic acids. Here. we report a newly developed energy-based coarse-grained model to predict the structure of ssDNA–ssDBP and ssRNA–ssRBP complexes and to assess their sequence-specific interactions and stabilities. We tuned two factors that can modulate specific recognition: base–aromatic stacking strength and the flexibility of the single-stranded nucleic acid. The model was successfully applied to predict the binding conformations of 12 distinct ssDBP and ssRBP structures with their cognate ssDNA and ssRNA partners having various sequences.

The production of bioactive IL-1β is mediated by a caspase-1-activating complex known as an ‘inflammasome’. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been associated with several human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and represents a potential therapeutic target for disrupting IL-1β production. We used molecular modeling guided by molecular dynamics simulations to design α-helical stapled peptides targeting the pyrin domain of the adaptor protein ASC to interrupt the development of its filament. which is crucial for NLRP3 inflammasome formation.

ContPlot for their display,2009,Arumay Pal and Ranjit Prasad Bahadur and Partha Sarathi Ray and Pinak Chakrabarti,10,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-10,BioMed Central,Depending on chemical features residues have preferred locations – interior or exterior – in protein structures. which also determine how many other residues are found around them. The close packing of residues is the hallmark of protein interior and protein-protein interaction sites. The average values of accessible surface area (ASA) and partner number (PN. the number of other residues within a distance of 4.5 Å from any atom of a given residue) of different residues have been determined and a webserver. ContPlot has been designed to display these values (relative to the average values) along the protein sequence. This would be useful to visually identify residues that are densely packed. or those involved in protein-protein interactions. The skewness observed in the distribution of PNs is indicative of the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the residue. The variation of ASA with PN can be analytically expressed in terms of a cubic equation. These equations (one for each residue) can be used to estimate the ASA of a polypeptide chain using the PNs of the individual residues in the structure. The atom-based PNs (obtained by counting surrounding atoms) are highly correlated to the residue-based PN. indicating that the latter can adequately capture the atomic details of packing. The average values of ASA and PN associated with each residue should be useful in protein structure prediction or fold-recognition algorithm.

The process entails partial or major unfolding that is largely driven by hydration. We model the role of hydration in aggregation using “Dehydrons.” “Dehydrons” are unsatisfied backbone hydrogen bonds in proteins that seek shielding from water molecules by associating with ligands or proteins. We find that the residues at aggregation interfaces have hydrated backbones. and in contrast to other forms of protein–protein interactions. are under less evolutionary pressure to be conserved. Combining evolutionary conservation of residues and extent of backbone hydration allows us to distinguish regions on proteins associated with aggregation (non‐conserved dehydron‐residues) from other interaction interfaces (conserved dehydron‐residues).

In humans. Msh2-Msh6 and Msh2-Msh3 are the two mismatch repair initiation factors that recognize DNA lesions. While X-ray crystal structures exist for these proteins in complex with DNA lesions. little is known about their structures during the initial search along nonspecific double-stranded DNA. because they are short-lived and difficult to determine experimentally.

1227832,Balance between asymmetry and abundance in multi-domain DNA-binding proteins may regulate the kinetics of their binding to DNA,2020,Arumay Pal and Yaakov Levy,16,PLoS computational biology,5,e1007867,Public Library of Science,DNA sequences are often recognized by multi-domain proteins that may have higher affinity and specificity than single-domain proteins. However. the higher affinity to DNA might be coupled with slower recognition kinetics. In this study. we address this balance between stability and kinetics for multi-domain Cys2His2- (C2H2-) type zinc-finger (ZF) proteins. These proteins are the most prevalent DNA-binding domain in eukaryotes and C2H2 type zinc-finger proteins (C2H2-ZFPs) constitute nearly one-half of all known and predicted transcription factors in human. Extensive contact with DNA via tandem ZF domains confers high stability on the sequence-specific complexes. However. this can limit target search efficiency. especially for low abundance ZFPs. Earlier. we found that asymmetrical distribution of electrostatic charge among the three ZF domains of the low abundance transcription factor Egr-1 facilitates its DNA search process. Here. on a diverse set of 273 human C2H2-ZFP comprised of 3–15 tandem ZF domains. we find that. in many cases. electrostatic charge and binding specificity are asymmetrically distributed among the ZF domains so that neighbouring domains have different DNA-binding properties. For proteins containing 3–6 ZF domains. we show that the low abundance proteins possess a higher degree of non-specific asymmetry and vice versa. Our findings suggest that where the electrostatics of tandem ZF domains are similar (i.e.. symmetrical). the ZFPs are more abundant to optimize their DNA search efficiency.

Virtually. all chronic inflammatory disorders are associated with the excess production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). IL-1β initiates and enhances inflammatory responses. hence. the production of bioactive IL-1β is normally tightly regulated at multiple levels: IL-1β is initially produced as an inactive precursor molecule that undergoes cleavage to produce bioactive IL-1β. While the bioactive cytokine can be secreted very rapidly. cleavage of IL-1β is the critical and rate-limiting step in driving inflammatory responses. Cleavage of IL-1β is mediated by a caspase-1-activating complex known as the ‘inflammasome’.

Two different enzymes are responsible for this modification. Protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 and 2 (POFUT1 and POFUT2. respectively). Both proteins have been characterised biologically and enzymatically but nothing is known at the molecular or structural level. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a catalytically functional POFUT1 in an apo-form and in complex with GDP-fucose and GDP. The enzyme belongs to the GT-B family and is not dependent on manganese for activity. GDP-fucose/GDP is localised in a conserved cavity connected to a large solvent exposed pocket. which we show is the binding site of epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats in the extracellular domain of the Notch Receptor. Through both mutational and kinetic studies we have identified which residues are involved in binding and catalysis and have determined that the Arg240 residue is a key catalytic residue. We also propose a novel SN1-like catalytic mechanism with formation of an intimate ion pair. in which the glycosidic bond is cleaved before the nucleophilic attack; and theoretical calculations at a DFT (B3LYP/6-31+G(d.p) support this mechanism.

The crystal structure of a 60-residue C-terminal deletion construct of ICP8. the major single-stranded DNA-binding protein from herpes simplex virus-1. was determined at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals a novel fold. consisting of a large N-terminal domain (residues 9-1038) and a small C-terminal domain (residues 1049-1129).

With the several advantages over small molecules. including high specificity. high penetration. ease of manufacturing. peptides have emerged as promising therapeutic molecules against many diseases. However. one of the bottlenecks in peptide/protein-based therapy is their toxicity. Therefore. in the present study. we developed in silico models for predicting toxicity of peptides and proteins.  Description We obtained toxic peptides having 35 or fewer residues from various databases for developing prediction models. Non-toxic or random peptides were obtained from SwissProt and TrEMBL. It was observed that certain residues like Cys. His. Asn. and Pro are abundant as well as preferred at various positions in toxic peptides. We developed models based on machine learning technique and quantitative matrix using various properties of peptides for predicting toxicity of peptides. The performance of dipeptide-based model in terms of accuracy was 94.50% with MCC 0.88. In addition. various motifs were extracted from the toxic peptides and this information was combined with dipeptide-based model for developing a hybrid model. In order to evaluate the over-optimization of the best model based on dipeptide composition. we evaluated its performance on independent datasets and achieved accuracy around 90%.

In the past. several methods have been developed for predicting conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen from its tertiary structure. This is the first attempt in this area to predict conformational B-cell epitope in an antigen from its amino acid sequence. All Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and tested on 187 non-redundant protein chains consisting of 2261 antibody interacting residues of B-cell epitopes. Models have been developed using binary profile of pattern (BPP) and physiochemical profile of patterns (PPP) and achieved a maximum MCC of 0.22 and 0.17 respectively. In this study. for the first time SVM model has been developed using composition profile of patterns (CPP) and achieved a maximum MCC of 0.73 with accuracy 86.59%. We compare our CPP based model with existing structure based methods and observed that our sequence based model is as good as structure based methods. This study demonstrates that prediction of conformational B-cell epitope in an antigen is possible from is primary sequence.

1227902,Improved method for linear B-cell epitope prediction using Antigen’s primary sequence,2013,Harinder Singh and Hifzur Rahman Ansari and Gajendra PS Raghava,8,PloS one,5,e62216,Public Library of Science,One of the major challenges in designing a peptide-based vaccine is the identification of antigenic regions in an antigen that can stimulate B-cell’s response. also called B-cell epitopes. In the past. several methods have been developed for the prediction of conformational and linear (or continuous) B-cell epitopes. However. the existing methods for predicting linear B-cell epitopes are far from perfection. In this study. an attempt has been made to develop an improved method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes. We have retrieved experimentally validated B-cell epitopes as well as non B-cell epitopes from Immune Epitope Database and derived two types of datasets called Lbtope_Variable and Lbtope_Fixed length datasets. The Lbtope_Variable dataset contains 14876 B-cell epitope and 23321 non-epitopes of variable length where as Lbtope_Fixed length dataset contains 12063 B-cell epitopes and 20589 non-epitopes of fixed length. We also evaluated the performance of models on above datasets after removing highly identical peptides from the datasets. In addition. we have derived third dataset Lbtope_Confirm having 1042 epitopes and 1795 non-epitopes where each epitope or non-epitope has been experimentally validated in at least two studies. A number of models have been developed to discriminate epitopes and non-epitopes using different machine-learning techniques like Support Vector Machine. and K-Nearest Neighbor.

Over the last few decades. the search for new drugs and drug targets has prompted an interest in these antibacterial peptides. We analyzed 486 antibacterial peptides. obtained from antimicrobial peptide database APD. in order to understand the preference of amino acid residues at specific positions in these peptides. It was observed that certain types of residues are preferred over others in antibacterial peptides. particularly at the N and C terminus. These observations encouraged us to develop a method for predicting antibacterial peptides in proteins from their amino acid sequence. First. the N-terminal residues were used for predicting antibacterial peptides using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Quantitative Matrices (QM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). which resulted in an accuracy of 83.63%. 84.78% and 87.85%. respectively.

Understanding their origin and evolution is of fundamental importance for genome studies. The identification of repeats and their units helps in deducing the intra-genomic dynamics as an important feature of comparative genomics. A major difficulty in identification of repeats arises from the fact that the repeat units can be either exact or imperfect. in tandem or dispersed. and of unspecified length. Results: The Spectral Repeat Finder program circumvents these problems by using a discrete Fourier transformation to identify significant periodicities present in a sequence.

Identifying a potential target and developing vaccines or antiviral drugs is an urgent demand in the absence of approved therapeutic agents. The 5'-capping mechanism of eukaryotic mRNA and some viruses such as coronaviruses (CoVs) are essential for maintaining the RNA stability and protein translation in the virus. SARS-CoV-2 encodes S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferase (MTase) enzyme characterized by nsp16 (2'-O-MTase) for generating the capped structure. The present study highlights the binding mechanism of nsp16 and nsp10 to identify the role of nsp10 in MTase activity. Furthermore. we investigated the conformational dynamics and energetics behind the binding of SAM to nsp16 and nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer by employing molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method. We observed from our simulations that the presence of nsp10 increases the favorable van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between SAM and nsp16. Thus. nsp10 acts as a stimulator for the strong binding of SAM to nsp16. The hydrophobic interactions were predominately identified for the nsp16-nsp10 interactions. Also. the stable hydrogen bonds between Ala83 (nsp16) and Tyr96 (nsp10). and between Gln87 (nsp16) and Leu45 (nsp10) play a vital role in the dimerization of nsp16 and nsp10. Besides.

In the current study. we have investigated the conformational dynamics of a triantennary and a tetraantennary hybrid N-glycans associated with the HIV glycoprotein using 20 μs long all-atom standard molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We classify these long sequences in terms of corresponding glycosidic linkages. which samples several minima resulting in the multiple co-existing conformers of the same. In our simulations. all the puckering states (4C1 to 1C4) of each monosaccharide except mannose are sampled. The change of sequences or the additional of an arm significantly restrict the sampling of the conformational space. Local conformation of each branch also changes upon the change of sequence. The end to end distance of the complex branch changes almost 10 Å in the presence of another branch. All these conformation changes involve the selective formation of inter-residue hydrogen bonds and watermediated bonding networks. Thus. our study supports the conformer selection mechanism of N-glycans. which helps to understand the protein-glycan interaction.

1227919,Hydroxyl‐radical production in physiological reactions: a novel function of peroxidase,1999,Si‐xue Chen and Peter Schopfer,260,European journal of biochemistry,3,726-735,Blackwell Science Ltd,Peroxidases catalyze the dehydrogenation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) of various phenolic and endiolic substrates in a peroxidatic reaction cycle. In addition. these enzymes exhibit an oxidase activity mediating the reduction of O2 to superoxide (O2·−) and H2O2 by substrates such as NADH or dihydroxyfumarate. Here we show that horseradish peroxidase can also catalyze a third type of reaction that results in the production of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) from H2O2 in the presence of O2·−. We provide evidence that to mediate this reaction. the ferric form of horseradish peroxidase must be converted by O2·− into the perferryl form (Compound III). in which the haem iron can assume the ferrous state. It is concluded that the ferric/perferryl peroxidase couple constitutes an effective biochemical catalyst for the production of ˙OH from O2·− and H2O2 (iron‐catalyzed Haber–Weiss reaction).

However. relatively little is known about the composition of CWPs in growing regions. We are using a proteomics approach to gain a comprehensive understanding of the identity of CWPs in the maize (Zea mays) primary root elongation zone. As the first step. we examined the effectiveness of a vacuum infiltration-centrifugation technique for extracting water-soluble and loosely ionically bound (fraction 1) CWPs from the root elongation zone. The purity of the CWP extract was evaluated by comparing with total soluble proteins extracted from homogenized tissue.

Heterologously expressed TWD1 does not exhibit cis-trans-peptidylprolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity and does not complement yeast FKBP12 mutants. suggesting that TWD1 acts indirectly via protein-protein interaction. Yeast two-hybrid protein interaction screens with TWD1 identified cDNA sequences that encode the C-terminal domain of Arabidopsis multidrugresistance-like ABC transporter AtPGP1.

Similarly. Ca2+ blocked both Pb2+ transport into the root and Pb2+ toxicity on root growth. The protective effect of Ca2+ on Pb2+ toxicity may be related to its inhibition of the heavy metal accumulation in the root tip. a potential target site of Pb2+ toxicity.

Such resistance poses a serious threat to insect pest control both in the UK and worldwide. Resistance may result from either an increase in the ability of the insect to detoxify the insecticide or by changes in the target protein with which the insecticide interacts. DDT. the pyrethrins and the synthetic pyrethroids (the latter currently accounting for around 17% of the world insecticide market). act on the voltage‐gated sodium channel proteins found in insect nerve cell membranes.

Ltd.,Naturally derived insecticides such as pyrethrum and man‐made insecticides such as DDT and the synthetic pyrethroids act on the voltage‐gated sodium channel proteins found in insect nerve‐cell membranes. The correct functioning of these channels is essential for the normal transmission of nerve impulses. and this process is disrupted by binding of the insecticides. leading to paralysis and eventual death. Some insect pest populations have evolved modifications of the sodium channel protein that inhibit the binding of the insecticide and result in the insect developing resistance. This perspective outlines the current understanding of the molecular processes underlying target‐site resistance to these insecticides (termed kdr and super‐kdr). and how this knowledge may in future contribute to the design of novel insecticidal compounds.

Using a multiplexed TaqMan® allelic discrimination assay. these mutations were found to be present in 98% of the mites surviving tau-fluvalinate treatment. The mutations were also found in 45% of the non-treated mites. suggesting a high potential for resistance evolution if selection pressure is applied.

Pyrethroids (derived from the natural pyrethrins of chrysanthemum flowers) share a similar mode of action to organochlorine compounds such as DDT and exert their neurotoxic effects by altering the gating kinetics of the sodium channel to slow activation and inactivation and thereby prolong the currents associated with membrane depolarisations (Narahashi. 1996). Nearly four decades after their introduction. pyrethroids are still one of the major groups of insecticides with important applications in controlling a wide range of agricultural pests and disease vectors. A detailed pharmacological analysis of exactly how pyrethroids interact with the insect sodium channel has not however proven possible because of the complexity of the target and the hydrophobic nature of pyrethroids.

There is a wide spectrum of plant responses to salinity that are defined by a range of adaptations at the cellular and the whole-plant levels. however. the mechanisms of sodium transport appear to be fundamentally similar. At the cellular level. sodium ions gain entry via several plasma membrane channels. As cytoplasmic sodium is toxic above threshold levels. it is extruded by plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiports that are energized by the proton gradient generated by the plasma membrane ATPase. Cytoplasmic Na+ may also be compartmentalized by vacuolar Na+/H+ antiports. These transporters are energized by the proton gradient generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase and H+-PPiase.

Despite their polyphyletic origins. halophytes appear to have evolved the same basic method of osmotic adjustment: accumulation of inorganic salts. mainly NaCl. in the vacuole and accumulation of organic solutes in the cytoplasm. Differences between halophyte and gly-cophyte ion transport systems are becoming apparent. The pathways by which Na+ and Cl− enters halophyte cells are not well understood but may involve ion channels and pinocytosis. in addition to Na+ and Cl− transporters.
