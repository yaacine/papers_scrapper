1333515,On Thermodynamic advantages of hybrid PWR-desalination plants,2008,K Ansari and H Sayyaadi and M Amidpour and A Saffari and T Sabzaligoll,,,,,,Nuclear desalination processes are used to produce power and potable water. and are regarded as more thermodynamically efficient and economically feasible than single purpose nuclear generators and water production plants. This study discussed a 1000 MW PWR nuclear power plant combined with a MED-TVC desalination unit with a capacity of 25.000 m{sup 3} per day. The dual purpose plant consisted of 3 interconnected systems. notably (1) a nuclear power plant with a conversion cycle for steam power generation and a turbo generator connection. (2) a coupling system. and (3) a thermal seawater desalination plant. Exergetic simulations were conducted to obtained energy and exergy flows for the hybrid plant. Exergetic efficiency. exergy destructions. and exergy losses were obtained for the proposed plant. Results of the analysis indicated that major exergy destructions occurred within the nuclear reactor. Turbines and steam generators were other sources of exergy destruction. It was concluded that the desalination unit was only responsible for 1.1 per cent of the total exergy destruction of the hybrid plant. 16 refs.. 6 tabs.. 5 figs.,True,kc4J7igAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21186806,15294574052384923807,/scholar?cites=15294574052384923807,,,,0,0,0
1333516,Exergy flows in hybrid PWR plants:(CH {sub 4}) fossil-PWR and (coal) fossil-PWR hybrid plants,2008,T Sabzaligoll and H Sayyaadi and K Ansari,,,,,,Hybrid thermal power plants involving nuclear and fossil energy are being developed because the efficiency of fossil power plants is normally higher than corresponding nuclear-only power plants. This paper presented a study of a fossil-nuclear power plant with an external coal fired superheater-economizer. A pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power plant with nominal power of 1000 megawatts was combined with a coal-fired superheater-economizer and the combination formed a new fossil-nuclear hybrid plant. Two types of fossil-PWR hybrid plants were modeled in this paper. One plant was supposed to operate with methane as a fossil fuel whereas in the second. coal was used as a fossil fuel. Energy and exergy analysis were performed for the new thermal power plant and the results were compared with the original PWR nuclear plant. Energy balance. irreversibility and exergy losses and destructions were determined for each component of the proposed systems and compared with total system losses. These exergy losses and destructions were compared with exergy that supply to both systems via nuclear fuel or combination of nuclear and fossil fuel. The advantages of developing hybrid power plants were then discussed based on case by case results. It was concluded the hybrid power plant has lower exergy destructions but a little higher exergy losses than the PWR plant due to flue gas from the combustion chamber. 13 refs.. 6 tabs.. 9 figs.,True,kc4J7igAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21186854,,,,,,0,0,0
1333517,Exergy analysis of a hybrid PWR-MED plant,2008,K Ansari and H Sayyaadi and M Amidpour and T Sabzaligoll,,,,,,Nuclear desalination s are highly attended for co-production of power and potable water in recent decades. They have proven to be more thermodynamically efficient and economically feasible than single purpose power generation and water production plants. The combination of a typical 1000-MW PWR nuclear power plant and a multiple-effect distiller-thermal vapor compression desalination unit with the capacity of 25000-m{sup 3}/day is considered here. Accurate investigation of energy and exergy flows by an exergetic simulation is suggested to be required to achieve better production management with a more cost effective and energy - efficient operation and gain a better understanding of the plant's performance. In this paper. energy and exergy analysis bas been carried out for the hybrid PWR-desalination plant. The exergetic efficiency. exergy destructions and exergy losses has been obtained for proposed plant. This analysis implies that major exergy destructions occur in nuclear reactor. Steam generator and turbines are second and third sources of exergy destruction and multiple-effect distiller has only 1.1% portion of the total exergy destruction.,True,kc4J7igAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21216409,,,,,,0,0,0

The economic per-formance of individual member countries–Brunei. Indonesia. Malaysia. Philippines. Singapore. and Thailand–has been impressive during the last two-and-a-half decades. The success of the economic development. in general. can be attributed to their market-oriented. outward-looking economic policies. The region. whose economy is closely related with the energy sector. comprises both energy importers and energy exporters. Three major producers of oil and gas–Indonesia. Malaysia. and Brunei–depend heavily on oil and gas exports for foreign exchange earnings and government revenues. Singapore. the largest oil-refining and trading centre in the region. is a major exporter of petroleum products. On the other hand. the Philippines and Thailand depend overwhelmingly on imported oil. The high degree of dependence on energy has made the economy of these countries vulnerable to energy prices. Despite the impressive economic growth. the region was greatly affected by the oil crises. Rapid price increases and vulnerability in supply in the 1970s led oilimporting countries to pursue various counter-acting policies. ASEAN countries formulated and implemented comprehensive energy policies; exploration and production activities of energy resources were intensified. Substitutions of other sources of energy for oil were sought and encouraged. Efforts were also made to increase the efficiency in energy use.

1333543,INTEGRATION IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION,1993,Shankar Sharma,27,Regional Economic Integration in the Asia-Pacific,,63,Inst of Southeast Asian Studies,Introduction Technical progress is one of the most important and powerful factors of economic growth. Although it is difficult to measure precisely the contribution of technical progress to economic growth for a variety of reasons (Nathan 1983. Jones 1976). it can be said that it enables the production of either more output for the same amount of inputs or better quality products (or totally new products). Because of these characteristics. technical progress causes a country's production frontier to shift outwards. thus increasing social welfare. Technology has remained important not only for sophisticated industries (such as electrical equipment. aerospace. machinery. and petroleum-related products) but also for processing raw materials and in labour-intensive industries. Developed countries have remained as the originators and developers of technology. These countries with their abundant capital resources and capital-intensive economy provide opportunities for strengthening capital-saving and technology-intensive innovations.,True,Hm1DFcYAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3052547394809422638&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0
1333544,3D kinematics using dual quaternions: theory and applications in neuroscience,2013,Guillaume Leclercq and Philippe Lefèvre and Gunnar Blohm,7,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,,7,Frontiers,In behavioral neuroscience. many experiments are developed in 1 or 2 spatial dimensions. but when scientists tackle problems in 3-dimensions (3D). they often face problems or new challenges. Results obtained for lower dimensions are not always extendable in 3D. In motor planning of eye. gaze or arm movements. or sensorimotor transformation problems. the 3D kinematics of external (stimuli) or internal (body parts) must often be considered: how to describe the 3D position and orientation of these objects and link them together? We describe how motors (dual quaternions) provide a convenient way to describe the 3D kinematics for position only (point transformation) or for combined position and orientation (through line transformation). easily modeling rotations. translations or screw motions or combinations of these. We also derive expressions for the velocities of points and lines as well as the transformation velocities. Then. we apply these tools to a motor planning task for manual tracking and to the modeling of forward and inverse kinematics of a 7dof 3-link arm to show the interest of dual quaternions as a tool to build models for these kinds of applications.,True,T5EJ5okAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,46,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00007/full,2302243666428232343,/scholar?cites=2302243666428232343,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00007/full,0,0,0

Moreover. we are often in motion ourselves. and this complicates motor planning. Indeed. the retinal and spatial motions of an object are different because of the retinal motion component induced by self-motion. Many studies have investigated motion perception during smooth pursuit and concluded that eye velocity is partially taken into account by the brain. Here we investigate whether the eye velocity during ongoing smooth pursuit is taken into account for the planning of visually guided manual tracking. We had 10 human participants manually track a target while in steady-state smooth pursuit toward another target such that the difference between the retinal and spatial target motion directions could be large. depending on both the direction …,True,T5EJ5okAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,14,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.00130.2013,9232507407854725966,/scholar?cites=9232507407854725966,,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00130.2013,0,0,0

To accurately plan visually guided manual tracking movements. the brain should ideally transform the retinal velocity input into a spatially appropriate motor plan. taking the three-dimensional (3D) eye-head-shoulder geometry into account. Indeed. retinal and spatial target velocity vectors generally do not align because of different eye-head postures. Alternatively. the planning could be crude (based only on retinal information) and the movement corrected online using visual feedback. This study aims to investigate how accurate the motor plan generated by the central nervous system is. We computed predictions about the movement plan if the eye and head position are taken into account (spatial hypothesis) or not (retinal hypothesis). For the motor plan to be accurate. the brain should compensate for the head roll and resulting ocular counterroll as well as the misalignment between retinal and spatial coordinates when the eyes lie in oblique gaze positions. Predictions were tested on human subjects who manually tracked moving targets in darkness and were compared to the initial arm direction. reflecting the motor plan. Subjects spatially accurately tracked the target. although imperfectly.

We propose an information model for each distributed energy resource (DER) which is intended to be used for participating in ancillary services (AS) market. likely (but not exclusively) through aggregation. This information model contains a mathematical description of the dynamic behaviour of the resource. its constraints for flexibility provision. a formulation of the different components of costs needed to provide flexibility on the AS market. and some ranges of values for each model parameter. The activities which have been carried out to achieve these objectives are illustrated in Figure 1. They are listed hereafter:• Creation of a taxonomy of the current and future flexible assets connected at the distribution level and that are able to provide ancillary services. The classification is based on the physical behaviour and the modelling similarities and it is the result of an extensive literature study.• Development of a flexibility model for each family of assets based on a selected generic modelling framework and proposition of realistic range of values for the models parameters.

Complicating the generation of these movements is the fact that different eye and head rotations can produce different retinal stimuli but giving rise to identical smooth pursuit trajectories. However. because our eyes accurately pursue targets regardless of eye and head orientation (Blohm G. Lefèvre P. J Neurophysiol 104: 2103–2115. 2010). the brain must somehow take these signals into account. To learn about the neural mechanisms potentially underlying this visual-to-motor transformation. we trained a physiologically inspired neural network model to combine two-dimensional (2D) retinal motion signals with three-dimensional (3D) eye and head orientation and velocity signals to generate a spatially correct 3D pursuit command.

1333560,The velocity visuomotor transformation for manual tracking,2013,Guillaume Leclercq,,,,,,Humans often perform visually guided arm movements in a dynamic environment (eg reaching. grasping. catching. hitting). To do so. the brain uses the visual (retinal) information about the target position and velocity to generate the arm movement. However. the target can be seen under different eye-head postures and/or we are often in motion ourselves (our eyes. head or whole body). which complicates the planning of the arm movement. Indeed. the relationship between the retinal and spatial motions of an object depends on the three-dimensional (3D) eye-head-shoulder geometry and kinematics while viewing the target. This thesis investigates whether the planning of arm movements towards moving targets takes these extra-retinal signals into account (and to what extent). or whether it relies on feedback mechanisms. To test this. we asked subjects to manually track a target viewed in various 3D eye-head-shoulder configurations and we analyzed the initial arm movement direction to distinguish between theses hypotheses. To make predictions and analyze data. we also developed an accurate model of the 3D eye-head kinematics. using the dual quaternion formalism. In the thesis we show that the brain takes the extra-retinal signals about the 3D eye and head position and velocity into account for the planning of manual tracking. using an internal model of the 3D eye-head-shoulder kinematics.

In this scenario. the development of small scale energy systems has become an interesting alternative to the conventional large scale centralized plants. Among these alternatives. small scale combined heat and power (CHP) plants based on Stirling Engines (SE) have attracted the interest among research and industry due to the potential advantages that offers. These include low maintenance. low noise during operation. a theoretically high electrical efficiency. and principally the fuel flexibility that the system offers. However. actual engine performances present very low electrical efficiencies and consequently few successful prototypes reached commercial maturity at elevated costs.Considering this situation. this thesis presents a numerical thermodynamic study for micro scale CHP-SE systems. The study is divided in two parts: The first part covers the engine analysis; and the second part studies the thermodynamic performance of the overall CHPSE system. For the engine analysis a detailed thermodynamic model suitable for the simulation of different engine configurations was developed.

UNAM,As part of the many alternatives for the development of new methods for sustainable energy transformation. the Stirling engine is distinguished due to the characteristics of an external combustion engine. with many advantages. These engines can be activated with heat. representing an additional option for the use of renewable energy. The Free Piston Stirling Engine (FPSE) is special due to the elimination of all wearing mechanisms of a typical kinematic Stirling engine. A linear mechanical storage device replaces the crank device of the kinematic one. making possible long operating life. higher efficiency. and zero maintenance. This document presents a theoretical model of a Free Piston Stirling Engine (FPSE) based on a dynamical and thermal analysis. As the core of the study. the “first-order analysis” of the thermal machine is implemented by taking some ideal assumptions. A technique of evolutionary computation is presented as a feasible solution for finding functional correct design parameters. For the dynamical part. the mathematical model is obtained through energy balances. and then a stability study is implemented to assure the oscillations of the machine. Results include several cases. which offer parameters such as cylinder and rod area. cooler temperature. heater temperature. piston and displacer mass. piston and displacer stiffness. phase angle. frequency. and power.

In addition. it includes the calculation of the mechanical efficiency taking into account the crank mechanism effectiveness and the forced work during the cycle. Consequently. the model aims to predict the work that can be effectively taken from the shaft. The model was compared with experimental data obtained in an experimental rig built for the engine prototype. The results showed an acceptable degree of accuracy when comparing with the experimental data. with errors ranging from 1%-8% for the temperature in the heater side. less than 1% error for the cooler …,True,ncHYtykAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:798497,,,,,,0,0,0

This concept allows for a simpler design. and potentially improves particle side heat transfer as found in heat transfer modelling and experiment results. Staging the particle heat exchanger into a series of short sections could prevent the full thermal development of granular flow. The incorporated flow constriction arrangement also allows renewal of the thermal entrance zone and re-mixing of particles at each stage. thus enhancing the particle-side heat transfer coefficient.,True,35WzQPMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X21002000,,,,,,0,0,0

In this paper. a coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method is developed to study the hydrodynamical evolution of a moving packed bed particle heat exchanger for CSP systems. The particle flow characteristics based on different heat exchanger designs (gap sizes) is investigated. It is found that the gap size has a profound implication on the particle mass flow rate. and the formation of stagnant zones of particle aggregation.

The deployment of porous metal foams in various heat exchangers is one such material that is rapidly gaining attention in the research field. However. an in-depth comparative analysis of fluid flow through metal foams is relatively scarce in the existing literature. This study aims to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to examine forced convection of various fluids through digitized samples of porous metal foams. Results have shown that an increase in fluid velocity results in a decline in average fluid temperature. Moreover. the type of fluid has a direct effect on the temperature distribution and spread of the fluid temperature around the foam ligaments. This study aims to address critical queries in the literature namely unravelling forced convection of fluids through metal foams for compact and lightweight heat exchangers.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach is a very powerful tool and it can be a good indicator of the lowest limit achievable with a selected database and with a selected set of inputs. This study investigates the applicability of the ANN as an efficient tool for the prediction of pure organic compounds’ thermal conductivity of three important families such as alkanes. ketones and silanes. for a wide range of temperatures.

Hydro-Fluoro-Olefins are low Global Warming Potential fluids. A summary of our experimental research activity on the thermodynamic properties of two environmentally friendly Hydro-Fluoro-Olefins. namely R1234yf and R1234ze (E). is reported. In particular. the measurements were performed with an isochoric apparatus and the apparatus specifically built to reach temperatures down to about 100 K. The data elaboration confirms the validity of the choice and that R1234yf and R1234ze (E) can be adopted in many domestic applications. Moreover. considering the reduction of the flammability issues of R1234yf and R1234ze (E). the properties of binary systems containing these fluids and carbon dioxide were analyzed.

Inspired by our experimental observations related to wave-rotor combustion chamber ignition. this work employs a numerical method to examine the sudden injection of a hot jet into a quiescent mixture of CH4–H2-air and the subsequent ignition.

Improving module performance is driven by a focus on lifetime yields and requirements of space–constraints sites. The materials used not only in thin film technologies but also crystalline pose problems in terms of measuring how much power is generated under STC. The fact that the modules power rates vary depends both on the amount of time they have been exposed to the sun and on their history of sunlight exposure in order to know the current state of the module. It is necessary to determine an easily accomplishable testing method that ensures the repeatability of the measurements of the power generated. This is essential because in order to have a reliable sample of the PV module population of a large PV plant. a huge no of modules must be measured. This paper shows different tests performed on different commercial crystalline PV modules both multi and mono. in order to find the best way to obtain measurements. A correlation was tested between sun exposure and power measured. A method for obtaining indoor measurements that takes periods of sunlight exposure into account is proposed. Also. temperature and irradiance coefficients were also determined for different technologies in order to obtain accurate measurements.

1333764,Assessment of N-1 criteria using energy storage,2017,Zora Luburić and Hrvoje Pandžić and Tomislav Plavšić and Ljupko Teklić and Vladimir Valentić,,,,1-6,IEEE,The goal of the Transmission System Operator is to run its power system in a reliable manner. incurring the lowest possible values of SAIDI and SAIFI indices to its consumers. This is achieved by using meshed networks. where after an outage of a line power flows through the remaining lines still satisfy all the technical constraints. However. in some cases it is difficult and costly to ensure parallel lines. which automatically voids the N-1 criterion. This paper examines generalized cases in which an energy storage system is used to increase security of supply. Specifically. energy storage is used to provide N-1 security reserve for a limited amount of time at locations where installation of additional transmission lines is difficult and costly. e.g.. remote islands.

It relies on the fundamental thermodynamic principles. being chiefly the first and second laws. The exergy destructions have been obtained from different parts of the cycle; after which several components are analyzed in terms of their thermodynamics efficiency. Additionally. exergy efficiency and coefficients of performance (COP) are thoroughly investigated. It can be observed from the results of the simulations; the greatest rate of the destruction of exergy exists in the absorber and is 35.87% of the destruction. Such irreversibility is primarily caused by the heat transfer of high-temperature variation.

Appl,,59-63,,The original contribution of the research is the developed monitoring system that can detect tool breakage in real time by using a combination of neural decision system and ANFIS tool wear predictor. The ANFIS method uses the relationship between flank wear and the resultant cutting force to estimate tool wear. Therefore. the ANFIS method is used to extract the features of tool states from cutting force signals. A neural network is used in tool condition monitoring system (TCM) as a decision making system to discriminate different malfunction states from measured signal. A series of experiments were conducted to determine the relationship between flank wear and cutting force as well as cutting parameters. The forces were measured using a piezoelectric dynamometer and data acquisition system. Simultaneously flank wear at the cutting edge was monitored by using a tool maker’s microscope.

Measurements of magnetic hysteresis loops were performed at roomtemperature with a vibrating sample magnetometer. Coercivity and square ness of the arrays are closely related to l/D and diameter of the nanowires. and the angle θ between the normal line of the alumina surface and the applied magnetic field. For the same diameter of 10 nm. the coercivity and squareness increase remarkably with l/D when the l/D is less than 100.

The water may either be what is known as good water. which displaces the crude oil out of the reservoir or bad water which is produced without contributing to the production of crude. Bad water is often the result of water invading the reservoir and communicating with the wellbore through permeable channels/fissures etc. As the water usually has a much lower viscosity than the crude oil at reservoir conditions. the effec tive permeability of the formation to water is much higher than to crude. which tends to result in more water than crude being produced once the water is in direct …,True,qR4pk8EAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,13,https://patents.google.com/patent/US8895483/en,2842014895228335158,/scholar?cites=2842014895228335158,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f6/6c/81/1b308eeacf11cd/US8895483.pdf,0,0,0

Conventional fracturing fluids are typically based on polysaccharides or their derivatives. which can provide enough viscosity to carry proppant deep into the formation at temperatures only up to 177 C (350 F). Beyond this temperature. these biopolymers hydrolyze too rapidly to be an effective and cost-efficient carry fluid; therefore. a new fluid was needed. We developed a new fluid system that can deliver the required rheological properties for successful fracturing operations up to bottom hole static temperature of 232 C (450 F) without the need for cool-down. This fluid is composed of a fast-hydrating synthetic copolymer and a metal crosslinker.

However. the results of their application are mixed. Since many reservoirs have an oil/water contact. or are close to an oil/water contact with poorly defined barriers. the fracture propagates into the water with minimal leakoff of the RPM into the fracture faces. In theory. the RPM polymer present in the interstitial water of the fracturing fluid leaks off into the fracture faces. as the hydraulic fracture propagates. For this to occur requires an inefficient fluid with high fluid loss. However. the properties of RPM fracturing fluids are similar to those of conventional fracturing fluids. highly viscous with leakoff control to ensure adequate fracture geometry and proppant placement.

Usually the function of the polymer is to control the viscosity of the aqueous fluids which are injected into the formation. For example. in water flooding the efficiency of the water flood is improved by adding a water soluble poly merto the aqueous phase and thereby decreasing the mobility difference between the injected water and the oil in place. Polymers are also used in acidizing and/or fracture acidizing in which acidic compositions are used to stimulate production of hydrocarbon from underground formations by increasing the formation porosity.

1333821,A New Approach to Hydraulic Fracturing With Relative Permeability Modifiers,2010,Manuel Lastre and Carlos Ernesto Medina Zarate and Juan Guillermo Molina and Eugenio Vergara and Arthur William Milne,,,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,In Colombia. relative permeability modifiers (RPMs) are often included in fracturing fluids to limit water production in wet producers. However. the results of their application are mixed. Since many reservoirs have an oil/water contact. or are close to an oil/water contact with poorly defined barriers. the fracture propagates into the water with minimal leakoff of the RPM into the fracture faces. In theory. the RPM polymer present in the interstitial water of the fracturing fluid leaks off into the fracture faces. as the hydraulic fracture propagates. For this to occur requires an inefficient fluid with high fluid loss. However. the properties of RPM fracturing fluids are similar to those of conventional fracturing fluids. highly viscous with leakoff control to ensure adequate fracture geometry and proppant placement. These properties favour vertical height growth of the hydraulic fracture and limit RPM leakoff into the fracture faces.,True,qR4pk8EAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-138926-MS,,,,,,0,0,0

In this regard. coprocessing biomass-derived feedstocks in conventional oil refineries might facilitate the transition from the current fossil-based transport to a biobased one. This article addresses the economic and environmental feasibility of such a coprocessing strategy. The biomass-based feedstocks considered include bio-oil and char from the fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. which are coprocessed in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). hydrocracking. and/or cogasification units. The assessment was based on the standardized concept of eco-efficiency. which relates the environmental and economic performances of a system following a life-cycle approach. Data from a complete simulation of the refinery process. from raw materials to products. were used to perform a life cycle costing and eco-efficiency assessment of alternative configurations of the coprocessing strategy. which were benchmarked against the conventional fossil refinery system. Among other relevant results. the eco-efficiency related to the system’s carbon footprint was found to improve when considering coprocessing in the hydrocracking unit. while coprocessing in FCC generally worsens the eco-efficiency score. Overall. it is concluded that coprocessing biomass-based feedstock in conventional crude oil refineries could be an eco-efficient energy solution. which requires a careful choice of the units where biofeedstock is fed.

1333847,Review on Energy Efficiency Progresses. Technologies and Strategies in the Ceramic Sector Focusing on Waste Heat Recovery,2020,Miguel Castro Oliveira and Muriel Iten and Pedro L Cruz and Helena Monteiro,13,,22,6096,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Thermal processes represent a considerable part of the total energy consumption in manufacturing industry. in sectors such as steel. aluminium. cement. ceramic and glass. among others. It can even be the predominant type of energy consumption in some sectors. High thermal energy processes are mostly associated to high thermal losses.(commonly denominated as waste heat). reinforcing the need for waste heat recovery (WHR) strategies. WHR has therefore been identified as a relevant solution to increase energy efficiency in industrial thermal applications. namely in energy intensive consumers. The ceramic sector is a clear example within the manufacturing industry mainly due to the fuel consumption required for the following processes: firing. drying and spray drying. This paper reviews studies on energy efficiency improvement measures including WHR practices applied to the ceramic sector. This focuses on technologies and strategies which have significant potential to promote energy savings and carbon emissions reduction. The measures have been grouped into three main categories:(i) equipment level;(ii) plant level; and (iii) outer plant level. Some examples include:(i) high efficiency burners;(ii) hot air recycling from kilns to other processes and installation of heat exchangers; and (iii) installation of gas turbine for combined heat and power (CHP). It is observed that energy efficiency solutions allow savings up to 50–60% in the case of high efficiency burners; 15% energy savings for hot air recycling solutions and 30% in the when gas turbines are considered for CHP.

This challenge is particularly high amongst residents of university campuses. where usage of electricity and carbon emission remain invisible to the students. In student residential accommodation. personal choices and social influences affect electricity consumption and ultimately the resultant reduction in carbon emissions.

Oxford University and Oxford Brookes University,The large demand of energy in the building sector is strongly related to how they are used. aside from their physical exterior/interior design [1]. Along these lines. it is valid to assume that the occupant behaviour contributes and is related to the energy consumption of a building. Electricity consumption is directly related to the actions taken by human beings [1]. In a hospital. this could mean usage of equipment. heating. water and so on. This implies that energy consumption in a specific area could be a function of the physical presence of human beings. referred to as occupancy. in this same area. However. not through a linear relationship as a study carried out by [2] has shown that the electricity consumption per person decreases as the occupants in an area increase. Thereby. it is important to consider dragging occupancy as part of an energy management plan carried out in an organisation. The effect of occupancy could be due to. but is not limited to. increased temperature resulting from the number of humans in an area or could mean an increased possibility of equipment usage. whether medical in case of hospitals or general equipment.

This has been attributed to global warming and increase in CO2 emission. Experts in this area are emphasising on the need to conserve energy both in industry and residential areas. This is especially true in University campuses where students do not have any direct insight or feedback on their energy consumption. Currently. there are few approaches aiming to reduce electricity usages in higher education institutions by providing students with feedback on their electricity consumption rates. These approaches suffer from the lack of motivations by the students to change their energy usage behaviours. To address this issue. they mainly provide students with incentives (gift rewards).

1333886,Low Frequency AC transmission for offshore wind power: A review,2016,Jonathan Ruddy and Ronan Meere and Terence O’Donnell,56,,,75-86,Pergamon,Offshore wind farm integration is providing substantial technical and economic challenges in the medium term and the trend for farther shore development in the future is focusing research and industry attention on cost effective transmission alternatives to existing technologies. In 2014. offshore wind capacity in Europe consisted of 8045 MW. with the majority of this connected to onshore grid via High Voltage AC (HVAC) transmission. Wind farms commissioned further offshore (>80 km) utilise High Voltage DC (HVDC) transmission for grid interconnection. The deployment and operation of Voltage Sourced Converter (VSC) HVDC substations in harsh offshore environments is still a major challenge for the offshore wind industry.

Its key advantages being the substantial gain in the range of transmissible power over traditional 50 Hz methods and the removal of the offshore converter compared to VSC-HVDC. This paper presents a system level techno-economic comparison of conventional VSC-HVDC to LFAC and focuses on the design and operation issues of the onshore step-up conversion to the grid frequency using a thyristor based cycloconverter.

This paper presents a techno-economic analysis and methodology for comparing both transmission methods in terms of power loss. reliability and capital investment costs. It is shown that LFAC when interfaced with an onshore cycloconverter can reduce loss. increase reliability and also decrease capital investment costs due in part to the absence of the offshore converter compared to VSC-HVDC.

Long HVAC cables and their associated low frequency resonance. connected to voltage source converters (VSC). provide technical challenges for the control of the offshore voltage. This paper provides the design of the offshore voltage “grid forming control” to maintain a stable offshore voltage accounting for the connection of a long HVAC cable connected to the VSC. Simulations are performed on an LFAC test system to examine the influence of controller parameters and the associated design tradeoffs between the selection of dq controller time constants and voltage control bandwidth.

The implementation of the LFAC transmission system envisaged in this work requires the use of full conversion wind turbines which output power to a 16.7 Hz collection network. which requires some redesign of the back to back converter typically used in such turbines. This paper presents the real time scaled hardware emulation of a full conversion wind turbine connected to a 16.7 Hz grid. The study concentrates on both software control strategies for the converters. highlighting the performance of the generator for the export of power to the grid.

1333907,An Integrated Prediction and Optimization Model of a Thermal Energy Production System in a Factory Producing Furniture Components,2020,Halil Akbaş and Gültekin Özdemir,13,Energies,22,5999,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Thermal energy is an important input of furniture components production. A thermal energy production system includes complex. non-linear. and changing combustion processes. The main focus of this article is the maximization of thermal energy production considering the inbuilt complexity of the thermal energy production system in a factory producing furniture components. To achieve this target. a data-driven prediction and optimization model to analyze and improve the performance of a thermal energy production system is implemented. The prediction models are constructed with daily data by using supervised machine learning algorithms. Importance analysis is also applied to select a subset of variables for the prediction models. The modeling accuracy of prediction algorithms is measured with statistical indicators. The most accurate prediction result was obtained using an artificial neural network model for thermal energy production. The integrated prediction and optimization model is designed with artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization models. Both controllable and uncontrollable variables were used as the inputs of the maximization model of thermal energy production. Thermal energy production is increased by 4.24% with respect to the optimal values of controllable variables determined by the integrated optimization model.,True,ceE2uhgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/22/5999,9991535694681638241,/scholar?cites=9991535694681638241,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/22/5999/pdf,0,0,0

Great efforts are being made to develop solid electrolytes or safer alternative battery chemistries. among which Zn-based batteries stand out for their high energy density and good compatibility with aqueous electrolyte. Theoretically. Zn-air batteries have very high volumetric energy density. which is ∼85% of that of Li-S batteries. However. Zn anodes have poor cycling performance because of their passivation (insulating discharge product ZnO) and dissolution (soluble zinc species in alkaline electrolytes) problems.In this work. we overcome these problems by modifying Zn anode with graphene oxide (Zn@GO) by a facile solution casting method.

Also. theoretical volumetric energy density of Zn-based batteries (e.g. Zn-air) is ~85% of lithium-sulfur battery. However. the rechargeability and specific capacity of Zn anodes are limited by passivation and dissolution. Here we report a ZnO@TiNxOy core/shell nanorod structure for deeply rechargeable Zn anodes. The small diameter (<500 nm) of ZnO prevents passivation and allows full utilization of active materials. while the thin and conformal TiNxOy coating mitigates Zn dissolution in alkaline electrolyte. mechanically maintains the nanostructure. and delivers electron to nanorods. As a result. the ZnO@TiNxOy core/shell nanorod anode achieves superior specific capacity and cycle life compared with bulk Zn foil and uncoated ZnO nanorod anodes.

So far. not much attention has been devoted to the use of EVs for public transportation. such as taxis and buses. However. a massive introduction of electric taxis (ETs) and electric buses (EBs) could generate issues in the grid. The challenges are different from those of private EVs. as their required load is much higher and the related time constraints must be considered with much more attention. These issues have begun to be studied within the last few years. This paper presents a review of the different approaches that have been proposed by various authors. to mitigate the impact of EBs and ETs on the future smart grid. Furthermore. some projects with regard to the integration of ETs and EBs around the world are presented. Some guidelines for future works are also proposed.

However. incorrect patterns can be obtained when the time-series components of electricity demand are not considered. Hence. this research proposes a new method for handling time-series components that significantly improves the ability to obtain patterns and detect anomalies in electrical consumption profiles. Patterns are found using the proposed method and two widespread methods for handling the time-series components. in order to compare the results. Through this study. the conditions that electricity demand data must meet for making the time-series analysis useful are established. Finally. one year of real electricity consumption is analyzed for two different cases to evaluate the effect of time-series treatment in the detection of anomalies. The proposed method differentiates between periods of high or low energy demand. identifying contextual anomalies. The results indicate that it is possible to reduce time and effort involved in data analysis. and improve the reliability of monitoring systems. without adding complex procedures.

Energy efficiency in buildings in use is a key element in the search for solutions to current energy problems. Many buildings in use can improve their energy consumption performance by implementing simple energy efficiency measures (EEM) in their facilities. After carrying out such actions. savings may be continued with just minimal maintenance. An additional key phase in classical energy studies is to define EEM to be implemented by the intervention of an external energy expert. since resident staff may not have the time. sufficient knowledge. nor experience in EEM. The energy expert intervention is of short duration (several days). and the total cost of the action may be moderate. In this paper. authors present several real examples implemented in three buildings on the Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV) campus after an external energy expert review. Savings. certified using real measured consumption before and after the action. represent around 10% of the total annual energy consumption in the buildings. and the payback of the EEM is approximately a few months.

Magenta and Yellow (CMY) under Terms of Open Source,2015,Victor Pulla and Xavier Serrano,61,Procedia Computer Science,,486-491,,In this paper we present the modeling of a neuro-fuzzy system to be applied in the mix of paint from color model cyan. magenta and yellow (CMY). We aim to research an efficient method to get a specific hue color that is located within color wheel. The modeling is focused in to generate a wide gamma of colors to paint crafts like Panama Hats only with mentioned colors. Variables of the system are given by the frame and shape of selection of color. We use a fuzzy controller to generate the magnitude of the CMY percentages and a neural network to interpret the components to dosage the assigned color.

The XRD patterns con rmed the rhombohedrally distorted perovskite structure of the synthesized samples. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) images and their respective histograms demonstrated that the grain size distributions are homogeneous and the average grain sizes increased with the increase of Li concentration in BiFeO3 bulk materials.

These models were tested to verify the validity of the simulation by being compared with experimental results which were taken from the literature. Variations of non-dimensional velocities in different positions according to the bluff body height were analysed and illustrated graphically. When the velocity distributions were examined. it was seen that the results of both two-and three-dimensional models agree with the experimental data. It was also seen that the velocities obtained from two-dimensional model matched up with the experimental data from the ground to the top of the bluff body.

The proteolytic activities are likely to play important roles in inflammatory diseases of arteries. lungs. joints. and intestines. Nuclear magnetic resonance line broadening indicates that regions surrounding the active sites of both proteases sample conformational substates within milliseconds.

1334035,Using Hybrid Solar Photovoltaic+ Combined Heat and Power Systems (PV+ CHP) to Enable Industrial Scale Indoor Plant Cultivation: a Feasibility Study,2016,Marco Hernandez Velasco and Nicolás Pérez-Mora and Tatiana Marras,,,,,,A rapid population growth linked to intensive agriculture has originated several problems such as soil degradation. groundwater depletion. forestland transformation. and eutrophication of aquatic systems. Vertical farming offers an alternative for producing plants indoors in a resources and space efficient manner. reducing leakage of chemicals. optimizing water and land use. and allowing year-round cultivation. Controlled environment agriculture (CEA) also enables urban residents to access locally grown plants that would have otherwise been imported from far away. reducing transport and storage emissions. This comes with a caveat: the energy loads increase to provide artificial illumination and keep an optimal climate. To address this issue. the present work studies the feasibility of using a hybrid photovoltaics and combined heat and power system (PV+ CHP) to satisfy the energy demands of an industrial-sized growth room. For this. different European locations and climates have been considered as well as various growth protocols.,True,A_xiaEEAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,0,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1049721,,,,,,0,0,0

The use of phase change materials in a building envelope can improve heat storage capacity and the thermal behavior of the wall. However. the small thermal conductivity of the phase change materials slows down the process of heat absorption and release. The present study suggests a new technical solution for improvement of thermal behavior of a phase change material plasterboards. It consists of perforating the panel with several small holes yielding a greater contact surface area with the surrounding air. This passive enhancement technique is implemented experimentally and numerically to check its performance. Results show that the perforated panels produces an augmentation in heat absorption and release.

They announced plans to build 49 GW of new coal-fired power capacity. about 6.3% of total EU installed generating capacity. The majority of proposed coal plants were located in Germany (> 20 GW). the United Kingdom (> 7 GW). the Netherlands (> 4 GW). and Poland (> 3 GW).Yet post-2008. only 10.5 GW of this planned capacity became operational. 37.8 GW (77%) was cancelled. and there remains 1.1 GW still in planning unlikely to ever be built. The capacity that was built has suffered from significant write-downs (see figures below) and has weighed down the balance sheets of conventional utilities. contributing to the sector’s general malaise and financial underperformance. The significant financial. human. and organisational capital wasted taking forward so many coal projects through the development process was also a major distraction for utilities just as the European power system entered an unprecedented period of technology. policy and market innovation.,True,Jw0EwYEAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,10,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:08e61321-83f9-4dfe-8800-24cbd96b59ca/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=The-fate-of-European-coal-fired-power-stations-planned-in-the-mid-2000s-Working-Paper.pdf&type_of_work=Working+paper,6585359547494192135,/scholar?cites=6585359547494192135,,,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:08e61321-83f9-4dfe-8800-24cbd96b59ca/download_file?file_format=pdf&safe_filename=The-fate-of-European-coal-fired-power-stations-planned-in-the-mid-2000s-Working-Paper.pdf&type_of_work=Working+paper,0,0,0

With estimates of annual coal. gas. and oil demand in 13.229 global population centres and 8.165 global power stations. we use a minimum-cost flow method to estimate global asset-level energy flows. We develop a method for cross-validating and tuning our network flow simulation using aggregate country-level import and export statistics.

1334080,Exploring the multifaceted role of pumped storage at Niagara,2016,Samiha Tahseen and Bryan W Karney,142,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,10,05016007,American Society of Civil Engineers,Energy systems are not only intrinsically interesting. because power is itself of importance; they raise fascinating trade-offs in other areas particularly since there are almost invariably technical. economic. and ecological dimensions to these considerations. This paper illustrates this interplay through a staged process that starts with a direct optimization approach for a pumped-storage facility with the simple goal of achieving an optimal profit given well-forecasted flows and energy prices. Sir Adam Beck Pumping Generating Station. located on the Niagara River. is selected as the subject of the model application. When analyzed for probable changes in current electricity rates. a 1–24% reduction in profit is realized depending on the month. Interestingly. relative to current design the model predicts only modest profit throughout the year with an increasing reservoir footprint.

The current study seeks to combine both paradigms through consideration of a legacy hydro system. Stretched along the border between Canada and the US and regulated by a 1950 treaty. the Niagara River currently provides almost 5000 MW of renewable power. This paper develops a HEC-ResSim representation of the existing reservoir (power) system and uses this model to explore a variety of possible future scenarios. These possibilities will ultimately include considering the sensitivity of the system to climate change. reducing tourist flows. and exploring using additional storage to augment operational flows. although the current paper particularly details the scenario involving increased power diversion by somewhat relaxing treaty restrictions.

Over the past one decade. a number of scholars have provided different frameworks to create knowledge for city authorities to help them make their cities sustainable. At the same time. some researcher also challenged the idea of using the term “sustainability” along side “city”. However. there is no doubt that cities yield high ecological footprint and having a framework to assist the planners and the policy makers to make the cities more environment friendly is essential. We have conducted a thorough review on the existing works on city sustainability and systematically combined the thoughts of different researchers to develop an updated framework addressing the shortcomings of the existing frameworks.,True,ioGMPjQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,http://www.ipcbee.com/vol32/007-ICESE2012-D025.pdf,13369440266193215005,/scholar?cites=13369440266193215005,,,http://www.ipcbee.com/vol32/007-ICESE2012-D025.pdf,0,0,0
1334084,The Water-Energy Nexus â A Modern Case Study to Reassess Hydropower in the Niagara River,2017,Samiha Tahseen,,,,,,The advent of variable renewable energy has created an urgent need for demand-based generation and storage. At present. with batteries still awaiting a major technological breakthrough. hydropower combined with pumped storage is suggested as a key response to demand variability. Even overlooking the technical demands. developing this potential resource in a sustainable way presents formidable challenges. While sustainability is a concern. the vulnerability of the resource to changing climatic conditions poses a major threat. The present study proposes five modelling approaches (and/or frameworks) as a foundation to a systems approach to hydropower and shows how these tools address the key challenges. Overall. the research addresses the current demand for dispatchable generation particularly in Ontario and proposes several alternatives including their sustainability assessment. Of the five models. the first two explore a variety of remuneration structures for pumped storage in the context of Ontario. The work begins with an optimization approach that evaluates the wholesale market for optimal profit. The tradeoff between hydropower and ecological targets is explored using a Constraint Method. The results are compared with models based on contracted price and an integrated valuation approach that accounts for the socioeconomic attributes of storage using representative applications. While the first two approaches concentrate on the project economies. the third model evaluates the potential for increased hydroelectric generation and assesses its vulnerability scenarios of climate change.

At this end. the study focuses on three research questions: what is the actual situation and what the trend has been in the last ten years in the various Italian geographic areas; if there are differences between geographic area and if these differences are statistically significant. The trend analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) have been used starting from secondary data on AIDA database (at the end 289 wine production companies). The profitability structure is assessed using two ratios: ROA and ROE. The findings show that the profitability structure of energy suppliers have not been substantially affected by the crisis in any geographic area. Moreover this factor produces statistically significant differences in the profitability structure of wine companies.,True,0PvXZ9IAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/1713051/535892/euromed2019-book-of-proceedings-2019-09-16.pdf#page=414,,,,,https://iris.unito.it/retrieve/handle/2318/1713051/535892/euromed2019-book-of-proceedings-2019-09-16.pdf#page=414,0,0,0

With the help of an integrated assessment model. the study puts the challenge of universal access in the wider context of climate change. energy. and sustainable development goals. The thesis results point out that. though considerable progress in electricity access will have been made and modest improvements in clean cooking will have strong benefits for human health. current efforts would still leave half a billion people without access to electricity and one billion people without access to clean cooking options – with implications for health. poverty. climate. and biodiversity goals. Achieving the universal access target could save the lives of up to a hundred thousand children. reduce fuelwood demand by up to 485 million tons. and cut energy-related residential CO2 emissions by up to 340 Mt annually by 2030. It requires an annual investment of 27-33 billion USD until 2030. considerably higher than the current level of investment. Several fuels and technologies. decentralised and centralised. fossil and renewable. traditional and modern. all play vital roles in achieving universal access to clean and modern energy in SSA.

The modern energies included solar. biomass. wind and nuclear. The energy mix has been evolving towards clean energies. From 1966–2005. the contribution of natural gas increased from 1.3% to 36.3% and the contribution of electricity was doubled from 4.1% to 8.9%. The share of oil products in domestic consumption has dropped from 84.3% to 53.4%. Iran has abundant renewable energy resources. including solar energy. wind power. geothermal energy. and biomass. as well as the ability to manufacture the relatively labor-intensive systems that harness these. By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas. creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. In many circumstances. these investments can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems. Over the past ten years some researches on solar and biomass energy have resulted in development and the establishment of a few small- and medium-scale electricity generation plants. powered via solar and biomass energy. There has also been the development of digesters to increase biogas production. Renewable energy is new to Iran and there is a long way to go. Except for the few afore mentioned projects. small-scale technologies to bring power to remote villages have a better chance of being adopted than those implemented at the national level.

Izrađen je model za usporedbu uvjeta probijanja i čvrstoće sjemenki. te su ispitane mehaničke značajke sjemenki radi utvrđivanja kritičnih vrijednosti važnih za rad uređaja za ljuštenje badema. Metodom je odzivnih površina utvrđen odnos između početnih parametara i krajnjih vrijednosti. a optimalni su uvjeti procesa određeni genetskim algoritmom pomoću funkcije prikladnosti. Raspodjela mehaničkih svojstava opisana je primjenom Weibullovog modela s dva parametra. i to oblika (β) i skaliranja (η). te su u cijelosti prikazane varijacije tih značajki. Potvrđeno je da je Weibullova funkcija prikladna za određivanje raspodjele mehaničkih svojstava. Metodom odzivnih površina uspješno je procijenjena energija loma (R²= 0. 94). te je utvrđeno da je odnos između mehaničkih svojstava i udjela vlage eksponencijalan. a onaj između mehaničkih svojstava i brzine povećanja opterećenja te promjera sonde polinoman.

Therefore. there has been an increased interest in developing more advanced attributes since the 90s. The significant progress in computing capacities has helped in this direction and has. consequently. led to improved geological interpretation. In this study. we propose a new approach based on transforming the 3D seismic data into seismic layering through a normal vector field analysis. Moreover. a multiscale approach is presented based on a neighboring sampling analysis of the normal vector field using a structure tensor generated and analyzed in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eigenvalues can be exploited individually or combined for detecting discontinuities or mapping salt bodies.

The demand stands at about 2.1 million metric tonnes per year. There is a shortfall of about 1.3 million metric tonnes. To solve this problem Nigeria has turned to fish importation while several other policies are being put in place by successive administrations to improve on local production. However. none of the efforts has been successful so far.

To achieve this objective requires that techniques for discovering and engaging services be developed and used across the lifetime of the service-based applications. Succeeding with SOC in this broader sense presupposes that additional techniques be developed for ensuring desired quality of service metrics and service-level agreements. The crucial aspect of using services is thus their governance. In this paper. we describe a conceptual modelling approach that integrates organisational and coordination theories to achieve contextualised service governance. The approach allows for the development and analysis of dynamic. flexible. and robust service-oriented business applications.,True,fNGfLfgAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,https://content.iospress.com/articles/multiagent-and-grid-systems/mgs00187,8567094737742864316,/scholar?cites=8567094737742864316,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45662126/Agent-based_organisational_governance_of20160516-5348-q2r4pf.pdf,0,0,0

Standards are required that permit describing the variety of energy conversion systems and that enable an interoperable exchange of energy amounts in an open. flexible manner by concurrently taking into account technical and market requirements. This paper introduces the concept of unifying Energy Agents. They have the potential to reduce the ever growing complexity that comes along with the various solutions presented or that are already available at the market.

Biomass is a good feedstock for biochar production through the pyrolysis process. There is potential to generate solid fuel from biomass. as there are large quantities of agricultural wastes available in Malaysia. This paper outlines the experimental study on the pyrolysis of durian rinds in Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). The effects of temperatures on the yield of biochar from the durian rinds were investigated. Increasing temperature resulted in increasing weight loss of the biomass sample. The total weight loss at the end of 920 C was 86.9%. This corresponds to the loss of water and volatile matter from the durian rinds. A multilayer feed-forward neural network (FANN) model was trained with an error back-propagation algorithm. Reaction time. temperature were used as the input parameters and weight loss was the output for the study.

Jar test experiments were conducted to find the optimal operating conditions for the removal of turbidity and total suspended solids from POME. At an optimal pH of 3. bio-coagulant dosage of 600 mg/L and room temperature of 28⁰C. an impressive removal of 65% of total suspended solids and 79% of turbidity was achieved. Along with this. a Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (FANN) was used to model the coagulation mechanism. Three different training algorithms were tested on the FANN. namely the Lavenberg-Marquardt. Bayesian Regularization and Scaled Conjugate Gradient methods. The best training algorithm was found to be Bayesian Regularization. based on the fact that it was in closer agreement with the experiment results and gave very low error percentage. The results of this study suggest that rambutan seeds have potential in being used as a bio-coagulant for POME treatment. Treatment efficiencies were reasonably high. and less sludge was produced using this natural treatment method. thus deemed to be more economical and environmentally friendly.,True,c_ShyMIAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,http://www.asianscientificresearch.com/journals/index.php/RCEST/article/view/64,,,,,https://www.asianscientificresearch.com/journals/index.php/RCEST/article/download/64/82,0,0,0

This research analysed several properties of the biochar produced from the banana peel biomasses at different temperatures. residence times and heating rates. This study focuses on the biochar yield and the EDX analysis of the biochar produced. Response surface methodology using central composite design (CCD) was used to optimize these parameters in the batch reactor pyrolysis system. These factors were operated in different ranges for banana peels. in which pyrolysis temperature (200 to 600°C). residence time (60 to 180 minutes) and heating rate (5 to 15°C min-1) were varied using 20 experiments respectively. Quality of the biochar was determined based on the biochar yield and O/C ratio. The optimum biochar chosen from the CCD model was applied to several pots of Ipomoea aquatica in different biochar dosage levels of 0. 3. 9 and 15 g (0. 1. 3 and 5 wt% of soil) respectively. Pot experiment was conducted with completely randomized design (CRD) of one factor with 5 replications to correlate the average plant heights with the biochar dosage levels.

1334281,Thermodynamics of indirect water injection in internal combustion engines: theoretical assessment of the fresh mixture cooling effect,2017,Alexandre Vaudrey,,,,,OSF Preprints,Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) is by far the most widespread of all prime movers. ie primary sources of mechanical power. According to several authors [1. 2]. this situation is probably not about to change. at least in the short run. However. in order to keep up being so helpful to mankind. ICE has to overcome at least two formidable challenges. The first one is related to the fuels such engines consume. predominantly of a fossil and then non sustainable nature 1. The second challenge ICE has to overcome is the control of its polluting emissions. including green house gases. nitrogen oxides and fine particles. whom daily consequences are already of a concrete and hazardous nature for a lot of us. ICE has thus to evolve in order to do its usual duty more cleanly and from a wider range of different fuels [2. 4. 5]. Because it helps to improve its performance and to decrease some of its polluting emissions. water injection (WI) is an old. well-known. but still promising solution that can help ICE in its quest for improvement [6. 7]. Most of previous studies of the effects of WI on ICE have been yet almost only based on experimental results. and are then partially ineffective to untangle its actual effects on different phases of the engine. For example. what is fresh mixture density increase we can expect from such process? By how much does it decreases the mechanical work consumed by the compression stroke? What are its consequences on the efficiency of the whole engine cycle?

However. even when a simple model is used to describe the engine. obtained. for example. thanks to finite dimensions thermodynamics. such a characteristic curve is often difficult to obtain and takes an explicit form only for the simplest of these models.

Electrification could change that. but can batteries really power actual heavy-duty operations? This study introduces a data-driven. bottom-up approach to explore the technical limits of electrification using real data from the entire Swiss truck fleet. Full electrification increased the total Swiss electricity demand by about 5%(3 TW h per year) over its current level and avoid about 1 megaton of CO 2 per year (accounting for emissions of generation). Realizing this potential required (1) an allowance to exceed current maximum permissible weight regulations.(2) a high-capacity grid access for charging at the home-base (at least 50 kW) and (3) a supporting intra-day energy infrastructure (we explored battery swapping).

For heavy-duty trucks. it is unclear if substituting Diesel is even an option. We developed a data-driven approach to explore this issue: it estimates feasibility considering the daily operation patterns of every vehicle in the fleet. This paper presents results for fuel cell propulsion systems. If every Swiss truck drove on hydrogen produced exclusively by electrolysis. full decarbonisation would draw over 8 TWh of renewable electricity (13% of the national consumption). That corresponds to roughly 60 km 2 of photovoltaic panels with 1.5 GW peak power.

The power plants are interconnected through rivers and water streams. consequently forming 21 independent (not exchanging water) cascades with one to five interconnected power plants in a single cascade. The modelled production of individual power plants. as well as aggregated production for the entire country. are validated against historical data.

There is still however disagreement on the methodologies and on the boundaries of the system to be assessed. This study argues that in an interconnected European context imports of power must be included in the calculations. Accordingly it proposes an extension of existing lean approaches taken from the literature in order to account for cross-border flows. The analysis shows that even countries with an almost carbon-free generation mix. like Switzerland. may sustain very high marginal emission factors. The application of the developed model to the case of e-mobility suggests that electric vehicles could have emissions levels comparable to modern conventional cars.

The impacts are analysed using a variety of metrics including transformer and line loadings.

Jelenlegi energiarendszerünk működése azonban nem fenntartható. sem a felhasznált erőforrások készleteinek korlátossága. sem az okozott környezeti terhelés következtében. Ezért hosszú távon az ellátás biztonsága is veszélybe kerül. A termelés döntő többségét. mintegy 78%-át adó fosszilis energiahordozók esetében a XXI. század közepére a legtöbb forrás bizonyosan túljut a kitermelési csúcson. utána pedig már csak rohamosan növekvő költségekkel állnak majd rendelkezésre. Az erőforrás hozzáférésének a kilátásai a nukleáris energia kapcsán sem jobbak (részaránya alig 2. 5%)(REN. 2014). hiszen mára az alapanyagául szolgáló uránérc könnyen hozzáférhető készleteit is kimerítettük (van Leeuwen. 2006).Ami az energiagazdálkodás környezetterhelését illeti. az egyik legnagyobb probléma. hogy a fosszilis energiaforrások égetéséből üvegházhatású gázok (például CO2) és más légszennyező anyagok (például savas ülepedést okozó SO2) keletkeznek. Az éghajlatváltozás fő felelősei az energiatermelés és a közlekedés. jelenleg együttesen az antropogén üvegházhatású gázkibocsátás 39%-át adják (IPCC. 2014). Összehasonlításképpen: a fosszilis források vagy az atomenergia alkalmazásával 10–50-szer annyi üvegházhatású gázt bocsátunk ki egységnyi energia előállításakor. mint a megújuló energiákkal (WEC. 2004).

E helyzet feltárására egy online kérdőíves felmérés szolgált. amelynek kitöltésében 256 magyar pedagógus vett részt.

This paper models the European Southern Gas Corridor to empirically compare the impacts of using entry-exit versus distance-related transmission pricing. Results show that distance-related tariffs for transportation of gas to Austria are much higher compared to the outcomes of an entry-exit tariff regime. Furthermore. the paper shows that the application of entry-exit tariffs in fact leads to an overall higher total producer netback. As such. the entry-exit tariff methodology may be favorable for the majority of energy market participants: upstream players for higher netback reasons; midstreamers/investors for bringing most gas to Central Europe; and regulators for creating a competitive landscape that facilitates the development of gas hubs and trading.

1334345,ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT,2015,K Shahzad Baig and J Wu and G Turcotte and HD Doan,26,ENVIRONMENT,3,,,Production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass is a promising alternative source of energy because this world is in need of a low cost. renewable and sustainable green energy source. Canada is among the top ten producers of wheat in the world with a capability of producing around 37.52 million tons of wheat straw per year. Hence. wheat straw could be a potential source of energy. Ozone was supposed to break down physical and chemical structure of lignin and hence make cellulose present in wheat straw more accessible for a conversion reaction. However. it was observed in our experimental work that without pretreatment of wheat straw. ozone did not produce the expected effects in the reaction with wheat straw. In spite of conducting the experiments under vigorous conditions only 13% of lignin removal was achieved. The proposed technique. which is a strategic use of water and ozone. has overcome the problem of slow reaction of ozone with wheat straw. Through this technique. around 90% acid insoluble lignin (AIL) removal was achieved by controlling parameters such as reaction time. flow rate of ozone-oxygen feed stream. ozone concentration in ozone-oxygen feed stream. water contents and particle size. The maximum AIL (90%) was obtained at flow rates of 4L/min. 2L/min and 1L/min at reaction times 90. 120 and 180 minutes. respectively. with 2% wt ozone concentration in ozone-oxygen stream. Other factors supported maximum lignin removal were water contents at 3 times of the dry weight of wheat straw and at 0.5 mm particle size of wheat straw.

This in turn allows us to assess the combination of capital. operating. and maintenance costs that minimize the total cost of a natural gas transportation system. We further show that the industry's production technology exhibits increasing returns to scale. That is. we find that the long-run marginal cost is lower than the long-run average cost per unit. The natural gas transmission cost function derived is consistent with the engineering aspects of the industry and may be used to find the minimal cost of a system to transport natural gas.,True,cfh1a4AAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,22,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00137910701854602,10306823715615778931,/scholar?cites=10306823715615778931,,,,0,0,0

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is well suited for conducting hyperscanning experiments because it measures local hemodynamic effects with a high sampling rate and. importantly. it can be applied in natural settings. not requiring strict motion restrictions. In this article. we present a protocol for conducting fNIRS hyperscanning experiments with parent-child dyads and for analyzing brain-to-brain synchrony.

While interpersonal synchrony is considered a multimodal phenomenon. it is not clear how different biological and behavioral synchrony markers are related to each other. The current study. thus. addresses whether INS is functionally-distinct from synchrony in other systems - specifically the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and motor behavior. To test this. we used a novel methodological approach. based on concurrent functional near-infrared spectroscopy-electrocardiography. recorded while N = 34 mother-child and stranger-child dyads (child mean age 14 years) engaged in cooperative or competitive tasks. Results showed a marked differentiation between neural. ANS and behavioral synchrony. Importantly. only in the neural domain was higher synchrony for mother-child compared to stranger-child dyads observed. Further. ANS and neural synchrony were positively related during competition but not during cooperation. These results suggest that synchrony in different behavioral and biological systems may reflect distinct processes. Mother-child INS may arise due to neural processes related to social affiliation. which go beyond shared arousal and similarities in behavior.,True,Hzuy72QAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.21.432077v1.abstract,11261428751696205847,/scholar?cites=11261428751696205847,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/02/21/2021.02.21.432077.full.pdf,0,0,0

Such endeavors are driven by attempts to extend the isolated perspective on the human brain by considering interacting persons9 brain activities. but a theoretical and computational framework for this purpose is still in its infancy. Here. we posit a comprehensive framework based on bipartite graphs for interbrain networks and address whether they provide meaningful insights into the neural underpinnings of social interactions. First. we show that the nodal density of such graphs exhibits nonrandom properties. While the current analyses mostly rely on global metrics. we encode the regions9 roles via matrix decomposition to obtain an interpretable network representation yielding both global and local insights. With Bayesian modeling. we reveal how synchrony patterns seeded in specific brain regions contribute to global effects. Beyond inferential inquiries. we demonstrate that graph representations can be used to predict individual social characteristics. outperforming functional connectivity estimators for this purpose.

Over the past several decades. access to abundant and low-cost energy has dramatically improved living standards and industrialization. ultimately leading to some of the highest growth in energy demand in the world. At present. virtually all electricity is generated using abundant. low-cost fossil fuels–primarily natural gas and oil. Should current trends continue. electricity demand will continue to rise. prompting a parallel increase in demand for these fuels. This chapter presents an overview of supply and demand in the GCC energy system. which is important for understanding how renewable energy can be integrated and optimized. It begins by describing the GCC energy system and the factors that contribute to energy demand. Its focus then turns to energy transformation in the electricity and water sectors. An assessment of fossil and renewable resources follows after which the next section addresses barriers to coordination in the form of government subsidized fuel prices and electricity tariffs. A sampling of existing energy policies. future targets. and power sector reforms is then covered and the chapter concludes with a discussion of opportunities and challenges of renewable energy in the context of the GCC.,True,Dq5y7UgAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,4,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=7Tn3DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA10&dq=info:iKPCbyOHGVcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=a51LQUaZnx&sig=m2KTownlwmF6TDVsiZJlN0x9q3g,6276196141986128776,/scholar?cites=6276196141986128776,,,,0,0,0
1334442,An integrated resource and biological growth model for estimating algal biomass production with geographic resolution,2010,David Michael Wogan,,,,,,This thesis describes a geographically- and temporally-resolved. integrated biological and engineering model that estimates algal biomass and lipid production under resource-limited conditions with hourly and county resolution. Four primary resources are considered in this model: sunlight. carbon dioxide. water. and land. The variation in quantity and distribution of these resources affects algae growth. and is integrated into the analysis using a Monod model of algae growth. solar insolation data. and published values for water. carbon dioxide. and land availability. Finally. lipid production is calculated by assuming oil content based on dry weight of the biomass. The model accommodates a range of growth and production scenarios. including water recycling. co-location with wastewater treatment plants and coal-fired generators. and photobioreactor type (open pond or tubular). among others. Results for every county in Texas indicate that between 86 million and 2.2 billion gallons of lipids per year can be produced statewide for the various growth scenarios. The analysis suggests that algal biomass and lipid production does indeed vary geographically and temporally across Texas. Overall. most counties are water-limited for algae production. not sunlight or carbon dioxide-limited. However. there are many nuances in biomass and lipid production by county. Counties in west Texas are typically not solar- or land-limited. but are constrained by either water or carbon dioxide resources. Consequently. counties in east Texas are limited by either water. or land (depending on the fraction of water recycling). Varying carbon dioxide concentration results …,True,Dq5y7UgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2010-12-2487,15896800377592813616,/scholar?cites=15896800377592813616,,,,0,0,0

Algal biomass and lipid production quantities are estimated using a fully integrated biological and engineering model that incorporates primary resources required for growth. such as carbon dioxide. sunlight and water. The biomass and lipid production are estimated at the county resolution in Texas. which accounts for geographic variation in primary resources from the Eastern half of the state. which has moderate solar resources and abundant water resources. to the Western half of the state. which has abundant solar resources and moderate water resources.

Laurger indaga le origini dell’architettura nel suo “Essai” [1]: inizialmente. l'uomo si trovava senza guide. l’architettura non esisteva. è un’invenzione umana. Essa nasce nel momento in cui l’uomo decide di porre un filtro verso la natura che lo circonda per proteggersi da pericoli. sole. pioggia e vento. L’essere umano non può pensare di agire al di fuori della logica naturale. ma può comprendere e sfruttare a proprio favore le leggi la regolano. Anche un artificio materiale come un edificio non può che sottostare alle leggi di comportamento e funzionamento della natura.  Per questo trovo coerente che oggi. in un momento in cui la comprensione e lo sfruttamento delle scienze ha portato l'uomo a mettere in pericolo l’ambiente stesso in cui vive. l’architettura si faccia carico di una responsabilità che. in fin dei conti. rispecchia la sua natura primigenia. Gli edifici sono oggi responsabili. in Europa. di circa il 40% delle emissioni di C02 in ambiente. La rilevanza della questione ambientale è da tempo stata riconosciuta dalle autorità internazionali. che si sono adoperate nell’ottica di una riduzione drastica delle emissioni elaborando piani d’azione e leggi a supporto di questo processo.  Il problema investe enormemente. come già accennato. il campo dell’edilizia; dal 2002 ben due direttive europee hanno affrontato il problema e delineato il concetto di Nearly-zero energy Building [2].

1334464,Plug-in electric vehicles: literature review,2011,Monica Ralston and Nick Nigro,,,,,Pew Center on Global Climate Change,The US transportation system relies on oil for 94 percent of delivered energy with no substitutes currently available at scale. This complete dependence on a single fuel has its origins in a time when oil was an inexpensive and exclusively domestic resource. but over time. it has created serious economic and national security vulnerabilities for the United States. In addition to highly volatile and economically damaging prices. petroleum fuels carry high environmental costs. With nearly 50 percent of US supplies deriving from foreign producers. high oil prices have also contributed heavily to an expanding trade deficit and national security concerns. Electrification of the transportation system with plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) has the potential to decrease the United States’ dependence on oil and the risks associated with its production and use. Using electricity as a fuel also has benefits for the average consumer. as it is less expensive than gasoline. and electricity prices are less volatile than gasoline prices (MIT 2010). From 1976 to 2008. the price of residential electricity decreased 0.1 percent in real terms while gasoline prices increased by 75 percent in real terms (EIA 2009). In the United States. petroleum accounts for less than one percent of electricity generated. almost all electricity is from domestic fuels. and electricity can be made from sources with almost no greenhouse gas emissions (EIA 2011). Therefore. electrification has the potential to mitigate some of the negative consequences of oil dependency on the economy. national security. and the environment (MIT 2010).,True,Zd3fQscAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,21,https://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2011/07/plug-in-electric-vehicles-literature-review.pdf,6718922460699016375,/scholar?cites=6718922460699016375,,,https://www.c2es.org/site/assets/uploads/2011/07/plug-in-electric-vehicles-literature-review.pdf,0,0,0

1334475,A Primer on Federal Surface Transportation Reauthorization and the Highway Trust Fund,2014,Nick Nigro and Cindy Burbank and Parsons Brinckerhoff,,Center for Climate and Energy Solutions,,,,For the first 50 years of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). user fees were sufficient to fund the federal portion of building and maintaining the nation’s transportation system. Limiting fees to actual users of services is seen as a more equitable approach than paying for transportation out of the general fund. For the past decade. however. user fee income to the HTF has not kept pace with federal authorization levels. and Congress has not taken action to increase the level of user fees or decrease federal authorizations to bring the fund’s obligations and revenues into balance. As a result. Congress has directed infusions from the General Fund to the HTF in 2008. 2009. 2010. 2013. and 2014. A recent slowing of growth in gasoline and diesel consumption due to both an increase in fuel efficiency and a reduction in vehicle miles traveled has exacerbated the funding imbalance. The imbalance is forecast to grow over time. and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 2025 federal fuel economy standards will cause gasoline tax revenues to fall by 21 percent by 2040 from the levels expected without the standards. as the older and less-efficient vehicle fleet completely turns over and less fuel is consumed. In order to restore the balance in the face of these trends.

However. navigating the complex tradeoffs between BEVs and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs)–in terms of vehicle depreciation. operational costs. fleet-related discounts and savings. and loan versus purchase decisions–can be challenging for fleets of any size. This paper presents the results of a total cost of ownership analysis using the Fleet Procurement Analysis Tool. a new publicly available tool developed by the authors for the EV Smart Fleets initiative. Using the tool. which allows comparison between different vehicle procurement structures. the authors answer the question: what factors determine a fleet’s suitability for BEVs? Nine factors are examined: access to the federal tax credit. electricity and gasoline cost. vehicle miles traveled. cost of carbon. battery costs. financing rate. self-versus third party insurance. self-versus third party maintenance. and bulk discounts. The authors find that the most important factors for shifting costs in favor of BEVs is the fleet’s ability to capture the federal tax credit and deploy these vehicles in high mileage applications. Battery costs also play an important role in the relative attractiveness of BEVs versus ICEVs. A brief discussion with strategies on how fleets can access the tax credit is provided.

The evaluation is based on four sets of governmental and international criteria for JI projects. the experiences of ten pilot JI projects. and the perspectives of seven collaborating authors from China. Egypt. India. Mexico. and Thailand. who interviewed relevant government and non-government staff involved in JI issue assessment in their countries. After examining the roles for potential JI institutions. they present early findings arguing for a decentralized national JI structure. which includes:(1) national governmental panels providing host country acceptance of proposed JI projects;(2) project parties providing the assessment data on the GHG reduction or sequestration for the projects;(3) technical experts calculating these GHG flows;(4) certified verification teams checking the GHG calculations; and (5) members of an international JI Secretariat training and certifying the assessors. as well as resolving challenges to the verifications. 86 refs.,True,zpl4vYcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,17,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/179239,9482265973060616335,/scholar?cites=9482265973060616335,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/179239,0,0,0

This paper has three objectives. First. it aims to present the passenger vehicle profile in Bahrain during the period 2000-2010. Second. it attempts to close the information gaps with regard to:(1) CO2 emissions.(2) fuel economy.(3) and vehicle-use intensity. Third. it develops future scenarios for the first time for this sector in Bahrain. The paper also develops a simplified bottom-up approach that utilises the limited data available on passenger vehicles. The vehicles’ specifications are used to calculate the missing indicators using information published on an official website. Descriptive analysis indicates a continuing trend towards buying large passenger vehicles. which may offset any significant savings gained from smaller vehicles. Further in-depth analysis indicates a fluctuating trend in the new models’ fuel economy. which is translated into an increasing rate of CO2 emissions. The Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario shows that CO2 emissions and energy demand of passenger vehicles will double by 2030 compared to 2010. While assuming all other factors constant. setting fuel economy standards can achieve up to 27% reduction in CO2 emissions. We conclude by emphasizing the need for policy intervention through introducing fuel economy standards in Bahrain.

Water is required to produce energy and energy is necessary in water production and management. As demands for water are escalating due to rapid population growth and urbanization. understanding and quantification of the interdependency between water and energy. along with analyzing nexus interactions. trade-offs and risks are a pre-requisite for effective and integrated planning and management of these two key sectors. This paper performs an assessment of the water-energy nexus in the municipal sector of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. where the electric energy footprint in the water value chain (groundwater. desalination and wastewater treatment) and the water footprint in electric energy generation (thermal power plants) are quantified using data for the year 2013. The results confirmed the high and strong dependency on energy for the municipal water cycle in the Eastern Province and revealed that energy generation dependency on freshwater resources is also major and evident. especially at farther distances from the coastal areas. Thermal desalination is by far the most energy intensive stage among the entire Eastern Province water cycle. In 2013. it was estimated 13% of the Eastern Province energy generation capacity goes for desalination. that’s a 5% of the Kingdom capacity. Substantial energy input for desalination in the Eastern Province is attributed to the production and conveyance of water to the Capital Riyadh (48.9 kWh/m3 and 4.2 kWh/m3 respectively).

1334508,Framework Conditions for Solar Thermal Energy Use in the Southern Mediterranean Countries,2007,Ibrahim Abdel Gelil and Arab Region,,,,,December,The Southern Mediterranean Partner Countries of the European Union are confronted with a rapidly increasing energy demand in the coming decades resulting from a set of demographic. socio-economic and resource related factors. The Mediterranean region has large potential for the use of renewable energies. particularly solar energy. due to its high level of solar radiation. Only a small variety of solar thermal technologies. mainly solar water heaters. is used in the region. The degree of dissemination of solar thermal technologies and the state of such technologies vary considerably across the Southern Mediterranean Countries and in relation to EU countries. A closer cooperation between research institutions and energy agencies from the Mediterranean Partner Countries and the EU is needed in order to promote a new generation of solar thermal and cooling systems in the Southern Mediterranean Countries.

Therefore. it is necessary to promote a certain degree of market intervention at both national and international levels. A growing number of countries in the region have already taken action by providing information and sharing experiences with other countries.Replacing incandescent lamps in the residential sector is one of the most obvious and easiest methods to achieve energy-efficiency in the region. The transition to efficient lighting can occur at a very low cost with existing technology and provide immediate results. The UNEP/GEF en. lighten initiative. developed estimates for 100 countries with the objective of calculating the potential electricity savings. CO2 emission reductions and the economic benefits that could be realized from phasing out inefficient lighting and replacing them with compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). 1 Out of the 100 countries analyzed. 19 were from the region. Eliminating inefficient lighting in the region would save nearly 31.8 Twh of electricity and slash 19.9 Mt of CO2. This is equivalent to removing about 5 million vehicles off the road. The cost for the region to transition to efficient lighting. is around 2. 8 billion USD. with a simple payback of 1.7 years.
