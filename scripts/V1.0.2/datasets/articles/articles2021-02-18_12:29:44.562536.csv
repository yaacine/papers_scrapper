1062269,NF-κB regulates protein quality control after heat stress through modulation of the BAG3–HspB8 complex,2012,Mathieu Nivon and Michel Abou-Samra and Emma Richet and Boris Guyot and André-Patrick Arrigo and Carole Kretz-Remy,125,Journal of cell science,5,1141-1151,The Company of Biologists Ltd,We previously found that the NF-κB transcription factor is activated during the recovery period after heat shock; moreover. we demonstrated that NF-κB is essential for cell survival after heat shock by activating autophagy. a mechanism that probably helps the cell to cope with hyperthermic stress through clearance of damaged proteins. In this study. we analyze the involvement of NF-κB in basal and heat-stress-induced protein quality control. by comparing the level of multiubiquitylated and/or aggregated proteins. and proteasome and autophagic activity in NF-κB-competent and NF-κB-incompetent cells. We show that NF-κB has only a minor role in basal protein quality control. where it modulates autophagosome maturation. By contrast. NF-κB is shown to be a key player in protein quality control after hyperthermia. Indeed.

To test this hypothesis. adiponectin-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were fed a Western diet (WD). WT mice under WD conditions displayed 63% higher adiponectin expression in myocytes than those under standard laboratory diet (SLD) conditions (P = 0.011). WD-fed KO mice exhibited approximately threefold larger myocyte degeneration than WT mice (P = 0.003). Even under SLD conditions. myotubes of KO mice displayed already moderate immunolabeling for markers of oxidative stress (peroxiredoxin-3/5) and for a lipid peroxidation product (hydroxynonenal).

ApN also exerts some anti-inflammatory effects on skeletal muscles in mice exposed to acute or chronic inflammation. Here. we investigate whether ApN could be sufficiently potent to counteract a severe degenerative muscle disease. with an inflammatory component such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Mdx mice (a DMD model caused by dystrophin mutation) were crossed with mice overexpressing ApN in order to generate mdx-ApN mice; only littermates were used. Different markers of inflammation/oxidative stress and components of signaling pathways were studied. Global force was assessed by in vivo functional tests. and muscle injury with Evans Blue Dye (EBD). Eventually. primary cultures of human myotubes were used. Circulating ApN was markedly diminished in mdx mice. Replenishment of ApN strikingly reduced muscle inflammation. oxidative stress. and enhanced the expression of myogenic differentiation markers along with that of utrophin A (a dystrophin analog) in mdx-ApN mice. Accordingly. mdx-ApN mice exhibited higher global force and endurance as well as decreased muscle damage as quantified by curtailed extravasation of EBD in myofibers. These beneficial effects of ApN were recapitulated in human myotubes. ApN mediates its protection via the adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1. the main ApN receptor in muscle) and the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling pathway. leading to downregulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammatory genes. together with upregulation of utrophin …,True,yWLFxc8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,29,https://skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13395-015-0051-9,6343486201811832670,/scholar?cites=6343486201811832670,,https://skeletalmusclejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13395-015-0051-9,0,0,0

The NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the inflammation process. and its aberrant activation leads to several inflammatory or immune diseases. Here we investigated the expression of the NLRP inflammasome in skeletal muscle and its contribution to DMD. We find that NLRP3 is expressed in skeletal muscle and show that ApN downregulates NLRP3 via its anti-inflammatory mediator. miR-711. This repression occurs both in vitro in C2C12 myotubes and in vivo after either local (via muscle electrotransfer) or systemic (by using transgenic mice) ApN supplementation. To explore the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a murine model of DMD. we crossed mdx mice with Nlrp3-knockout mice. In mdx mice. all components of the inflammasome were upregulated in muscle. and the complex was overactivated. By contrast. in mdx mice lacking Nlrp3. there was a reduction in caspase-1 activation. inflammation and oxidative stress in dystrophic muscle. and these mice showed higher global muscle force/endurance than regular mdx mice as well as decreased muscle damage. To investigate the relevance of NLPR3 regulation in a human disease context. we characterized NLRP3 expression in primary cultures of myotubes from DMD subjects and found a threefold increase compared to control subjects.

Muscling Pills… or Everything Together?,2020,Michel Abou-Samra and Camille M Selvais and Nicolas Dubuisson and Sonia M Brichard,21,,7,2620,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Adiponectin (ApN) is a hormone abundantly secreted by adipocytes and it is known to be tightly linked to the metabolic syndrome. It promotes insulin-sensitizing. fat-burning. and anti-atherosclerotic actions. thereby effectively counteracting several metabolic disorders. including type 2 diabetes. obesity. and cardiovascular diseases. ApN is also known today to possess powerful anti-inflammatory/oxidative and pro-myogenic effects on skeletal muscles exposed to acute or chronic inflammation and injury. mainly through AdipoR1 (ApN specific muscle receptor) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. but also via T-cadherin. In this review. we will report all the beneficial and protective properties that ApN can exert. specifically on the skeletal muscle as a target tissue. We will highlight its effects and mechanisms of action. first in healthy skeletal muscle including exercised muscle. and second in diseased muscle from a variety of pathological conditions. In the end. we will go over some of AdipoRs agonists that can be easily produced and administered. and which can greatly mimic ApN. These interesting and newly identified molecules could pave the way towards future therapeutic approaches to potentially prevent or combat not only skeletal muscle disorders but also a plethora of other diseases with sterile inflammation or metabolic dysfunction.

Its depositional evolution during the Neogene and the    Quaternary has been controlled by tectonic processes. Miocene extensional    subsidence was followed by the Pliocene-Quaternary inversion of the basin.    The latter was accomplished as the result of replacement of the tensile by    the compressive stress field. Since the Late Neogene. the regional tectonic    activity has been controlled by compressive stress produced by the    northnortheastern propagation of the Adria microplate. In the compressive    NE-SW-oriented stress field. the recent structural plan of the Pannonian    basin and its wider environment. including its southern periphery. was    reactivated. The youngest tectonic deformations are characterized by positive    and negative vertical motions of large intrabasinal segments and basinal    periphery. resulting in the final inversion of the basin. The effects of the    basinal inversion can be recognized in genetic features of Quaternary    sediments and geomorphological characteristics of the relief.

Each decision will be modified by habitat and habitat disturbance. We evaluate the effects of habitat disturbance on foraging behaviour by imagining an initially homogeneous environment that is altered to create patches of different sizes. Disturbance increases predation risk. or otherwise alters patch profitability. Foragers can respond by changing their pattern of foraging. or by reducing their activity. We develop predictions for each scenario.

Due to the lack of any nationwide leukemia screening program. the majority of the people are not aware of the disease. Epidemiological study can play a vital role in understanding the occurrence and outcome of the disease. Patients and Methods: Focusing on variables like age. sex. race. blood group and lifestyle habits. detailed reports of 417 males and 230 females (M: F ratio 1.8: 1) were collected from different hospitals of North Karnataka and analyzed for their risk of leukemia. Results: Compared to female patients. Hindu males were found to have greater risk of occurrence of leukemia (p= 0.0333). The males of scheduled caste (SC) and Lingayat communities showed a high risk than other communities (p= 0.000). The occurrence of AML showed a significant relationship with ABO blood groups (p= 0.0090). The frequency of leukemia is quite high in Belgaum district when compared to others districts of North Karnataka and totally absent in Bidar district. The reasons need precise molecular and genetical studies of the populaton.

However. the role of Pol δ in replication of the leading strand is uncertain. In this work. we use a reporter system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to measure mutation rates at specific base pairs in order to determine the effect of heterozygous or homozygous proofreading-defective mutants of either Pol ε or Pol δ in diploid strains. We find that wild-type Pol ε molecules cannot proofread errors created by proofreading-defective Pol ε molecules. whereas Pol δ can not only proofread errors created by proofreading-defective Pol δ molecules. but can also proofread errors created by Pol ε-defective molecules. These results suggest that any interruption in DNA synthesis on the leading strand is likely to result in completion by Pol δ and also explain the higher mutation rates observed in Pol δ-proofreading mutants compared to Pol ε-proofreading defective mutants. For strains reverting via AT→GC. TA→GC. CG→AT. and GC→AT mutations. we find in addition a strong effect of gene orientation on mutation rate in proofreading-defective strains and demonstrate that much of this orientation dependence is due to differential efficiencies of mispair elongation. We also find that a 3′-terminal 8 oxoG. unlike a 3′-terminal G. is efficiently extended opposite an A and is not subject to proofreading.

However. distinguishing genes related to ecological specialism from other sources of selection and more random changes is a challenge. Here. we describe the genome of Drosophila montana. which is the most extremely cold-adapted Drosophila species known. We use branch tests to identify genes showing accelerated divergence in contrasts between cold- and warm-adapted species and identify about 250 genes that show differences. possibly driven by a lower synonymous substitution rate in cold-adapted species.

Debate continues over what proportion of lncRNAs are functional or merely represent transcriptional noise. Although characterization of individual lncRNAs has identified approximately 200 functional loci across the Eukarya. general surveys have found only modest or no evidence of long-term evolutionary conservation. Although this lack of conservation suggests that most lncRNAs are nonfunctional. the possibility remains that some represent recent evolutionary innovations. We examine recent selection pressures acting on lncRNAs in mouse populations. We compare patterns of within-species nucleotide variation at approximately 10.000 lncRNA loci in a cohort of the wild house mouse.

To tackle this issue and to define relevant spatial and temporal scales of variation for a population genetic model system. the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. we have founded the European Drosophila Population Genomics Consortium (DrosEU). Our principal objective is to employ the strengths of this collaborative consortium to extensively sample and sequence natural populations on a continent-wide scale and across distinct timescales. Here we present the first analysis of the first DrosEU pool-sequencing dataset. consisting of 48 population samples collected across the European continent in 2014. The analysis of this comprehensive dataset uncovers novel patterns of variation at multiple levels: genome-wide neutral SNPs. mtDNA haplotypes. inversions and TEs that exhibit previously cryptic longitudinal population structure across the European continent; signatures of selective sweeps shared among the majority of European populations; presumably adaptive clines in inversions; and geographic variation in TEs.

That background assumptions co-determine choice of methodology. data interpretation. and choice of relevant evidence is an uncontroversial claim in modern basic science. Furthermore. it is commonly accepted that. unless explicated. disagreements in background assumptions can lead to misunderstanding as well as miscommunication. Here. we extend the discussion on background assumptions from basic science to the debate over genetically modified (GM) plants risk assessment. In this realm. while the different political. social and economic values are often mentioned. the identity and role of background assumptions at play are rarely examined. We use an example from the debate over risk assessment of stacked genetically modified plants (GM stacks). obtained by applying conventional breeding techniques to GM plants. There are two main regulatory practices of GM stacks: (i) regulate as conventional hybrids and (ii) regulate as new GM plants. We analyzed eight papers representative of these positions and found that. in all cases. additional premises are needed to reach the stated conclusions.

Of particular importance are issues concerning how to ascertain. collect. confirm. and communicate the best evidence to assist the clinical choice for individual patients. Here. we propose that these practical challenges partially stem from deeper fundamental issues concerning the epistemology of pharmacovigilance. After reviewing some of the persistent challenges. recent measures. and suggestions in the current pharmacovigilance literature. we support the argument that the detection of potential adverse drug reactions ought to be seen as a serendipitous scientific discovery. We further take up recent innovations from the multidisciplinary field of serendipity research about the importance of networks. diversity of expertise. and plurality of methodological perspectives for cultivating serendipitous discovery.

1062356,Causal evidence and dispositions in medicine and public health,2020,Elena Rocca and Rani Lill Anjum,17,International journal of environmental research and public health,6,1813,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Since the introduction of evidence-based medicine. there have been discussions about the epistemic primacy of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for establishing causality in medicine and public health. A growing movement within philosophy of science calls instead for evidential pluralism: that we need more than one single method to investigate health outcomes. How should such evidential pluralism look in practice? How useful are the various methods available for causal inquiry? Further. how should different types of causal evidence be evaluated? This paper proposes a constructive answer and introduces a framework aimed at supporting scientists in developing appropriate methodological approaches for exploring causality. We start from the philosophical tradition that highlights intrinsic properties (dispositions. causal powers or capacities) as essential features of causality. This abstract idea has wide methodological implications. The paper explains how different methods. such as lab experiments. case studies. N-of-1 trials. case control studies. cohort studies. RCTs and patient narratives. all have some strengths and some limitations for picking out intrinsic causal properties. We explain why considering philosophy of causality is crucial for evaluating causality in the health sciences. In our proposal. we combine the various methods in a temporal process. which could then take us from an observed phenomenon (eg. a correlation) to a causal hypothesis and. finally. to improved theoretical knowledge.,True,ka0BibkAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,5,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/6/1813,17817292137795329048,/scholar?cites=17817292137795329048,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/6/1813/pdf,0,0,0

This study used an anthocyanin-enriched transgenic petunia line. PM6. expressing RsMYB1. The tolerance of the PM6 line to heavy metal stress was investigated by examining several physiological and biochemical factors. and the transcript levels of the genes related to metal detoxification and antioxidant activity were investigated. Under normal conditions (control conditions). transgenic petunia plants (T2-PM6) expressing RsMYB1. as well as wild-type (WT) plants. were able to thrive by producing well-developed broad leaves and regular roots.

However. little data exist on how Ros1 expression alone controls anthocyanin regulation and whether it is involved in the mechanism that leads to abiotic stress tolerance. Overexpression of Ros1 promoted accumulation of anthocyanin in leaves and flowers of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum ‘Xanthi’) by elevating all key biosynthesis genes; promotion largely occurred through regulation of NtDFR and NtANS in the former and elevation of NtDFR transcript levels in the latter. Under normal conditions. T2-Ros1 and the wild type (WT) were able to survive by producing well-developed broad leaves and regular roots. whereas a reduction in plant growth was observed under cold and drought stress. However. the T2-Ros1 was able to tolerate the stresses better than the WT by induction of greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activity (DPPH.

Ros1 was phylogenetically clustered with other MYB TFs that confer different abiotic stresses.

Edun,2017,Da Y Park and Aung H Naing and Trinh N Ai and Jeung-Sul Han and In-Kyu Kang and Chang K Kim,8,Frontiers in plant science,,1601,Frontiers,We investigated the effects of sucrose and Nano-silver (NAg) on extending the vase life of cut carnation flowers ‘Edun’. Sucrose suppressed ethylene production by downregulating the genes that code for its biosynthesis. Relative to the control. however. sucrose significantly increased bacterial proliferation on cut stem surfaces and reduced relative fresh weight (RFW). antioxidant activity. and cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene (DcCPi) expression. Consequently. the sucrose-treated flowers had shorter vase lives than the control. In contrast. NAg suppressed ethylene production in the petal. prevented bacterial blockage in the cut stem surface. and improved all the aforementioned parameters. Therefore. NAg increased flower longevity. The most effective treatment in terms of longevity extension and parameter improvement. however. was the combination of NAg and sucrose. These results suggest that sucrose can suppress ethylene production but does not necessarily extend the vase life of the flower cultivar. which is partially or totally insensitive to ethylene. The role of NAg in increasing cut carnation longevity is mainly to inhibit xylem blockage rather than suppress ethylene production. and the combined effect of NAg and sucrose is most effective at prolonging cut carnation vase life. likely due to their synergetic effects on multiple modes of action.,True,PEP3jbsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,10,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01601/full,9549513166267724513,/scholar?cites=9549513166267724513,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01601/full,0,0,0

Arbuscular mycorrhizae (phylum Glomeromycota) form symbiotic relationships with over 80% of vascular plants. In return for carbon. these fungi improve plant health and tolerance to environmental stress. This symbiosis is over 400 million years old and there are currently over 200 known arbuscular mycorrhizae. with dozens of new species described annually. Metagenomic sequencing of native soil communities. from species-rich meadows to mangroves. suggests biologically diverse habitats support a variety of mycorrhizal species with potential agricultural. medical. and biotechnological applications.

1062391,Endoplasmic reticulum stress in metabolic disorders,2018,Rose Ghemrawi and Shyue-Fang Battaglia-Hsu and Carole Arnold,7,,6,63,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Metabolic disorders have become among the most serious threats to human health. leading to severe chronic diseases such as obesity. type 2 diabetes. and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. as well as cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly. despite the fact that each of these diseases has different physiological and clinical symptoms. they appear to share certain pathological traits such as intracellular stress and inflammation induced by metabolic disturbance stemmed from over nutrition frequently aggravated by a modern. sedentary life style. These modern ways of living inundate cells and organs with saturating levels of sugar and fat. leading to glycotoxicity and lipotoxicity that induce intracellular stress signaling ranging from oxidative to ER stress response to cope with the metabolic insults (Mukherjee. et al.. 2015). In this review. we discuss the roles played by cellular stress and its responses in shaping metabolic disorders. We have summarized here current mechanistic insights explaining the pathogenesis of these disorders. These are followed by a discussion of the latest therapies targeting the stress response pathways.

Sirtuin 1 deacetylase (SIRT1) triggers cell response to nutritional stress through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Recently. we have established a N1E115 dopaminergic cell model by stable expression of a transcobalamin–oleosin chimera (TO). which impairs cellular availability of vitamin B12. decreases methionine synthase activity and SAM level. and reduces cell proliferation. In contrast. oleosin-transcobalamin chimera (OT) does not modify the phenotype of transfected cells.

1062397,Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Unfolded Protein Response in Neurodegenerative Diseases,2020,Rose Ghemrawi and Mostafa Khair,21,Int J Mol Sci,17,E6127,mdpi,The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important organelle involved in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis. The accumulation of unfolded proteins leads to an ER stress. followed by an adaptive response via the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease 1α (IRE1α) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathways. However. prolonged cell stress activates apoptosis signaling leading to cell death. Neuronal cells are particularly sensitive to protein misfolding. consequently ER and UPR dysfunctions were found to be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinson’s disease. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and prions diseases. among others characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins. Pharmacological UPR modulation in affected tissues may contribute to the treatment and prevention of neurodegeneration. The association between ER stress. UPR and neuropathology is well established. In this review. we provide up-to-date evidence of UPR activation in neurodegenerative disorders followed by therapeutic strategies targeting the UPR and ameliorating the toxic effects of protein unfolding and aggregation.

La vitamine B12 joue un rôle majeur dans les régulations épigénomiques dépendantes de la S-adénosyl méthionine (SAM). Nous avons établi un modèle de cellules neuronales dopaminergiques NIE115 carencé en vitamine B12 par l'expression stable d'une protéine chimère : la transcobalamine-oléosine (TO) réduisant la disponibilité cellulaire en B12. la SAM et la prolifération cellulaire. La protéine chimère oléosine-transcobalamine (OT) ne lie pas la B12 et constitue un contrôle. Les cellules TO ont une diminution B12-dépendante de la déacétylase SIRT1 (sirtuin1) et un stress du réticulum endoplasmique (RE) avec une augmentation des transducteurs transmembranaires. une diminution des protéines chaperonnes et une augmentation des marqueurs pro-apoptotiques. La diminution de l'expression de SIRT1 déclenche le stress du RE en réponse au stress nutritionnel. Cette diminution produit une augmentation de HSF1 acétylé diminuant l'expression des protéines chaperons. L'ajout de B12. des activateurs de SIRT1 et HSF1. la surexpression de SIRT1 et HSF1 réduisent le stress du RE.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying kinase diversification. we studied the CMGC protein kinases using ancestral reconstruction. Within this group. the cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) require proline at the +1 position of their substrates. while Ime2 prefers arginine. The resurrected common ancestor of CDKs. MAPKs. and Ime2 could phosphorylate substrates with +1 proline or arginine. with preference for proline. This specificity changed to a strong preference for +1 arginine in the lineage leading to Ime2 via an intermediate with equal specificity for proline and arginine. Mutant analysis revealed that a variable residue within the kinase catalytic cleft. DFGx. modulates +1 specificity. Expansion of Ime2 kinase specificity by mutation of this residue did not cause dominant deleterious effects in vivo. Tolerance of cells to new specificities likely enabled the evolutionary divergence of kinases.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04126.001,True,81FOpgYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,42,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04126,18389333452134504076,/scholar?cites=18389333452134504076,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04126.pdf,0,0,0

However. the mechanisms that regulate crowding are unknown. We developed genetically encoded multimeric (GEM) nanoparticles to study the physical properties of the cytoplasm. GEMs self-assemble into bright. stable fluorescent particles of defined size and shape. We used this system to discover signaling pathways that modulate crowding in yeast and mammalian cells. We found that the mTORC1 pathway tunes macromolecular crowding through regulation of ribosome concentration and thereby regulates the effective diffusion of macromolecules larger than 16 nm in diameter but has no effect on the diffusion of molecules at the 5 nm length-scale. thus providing a mechanism to differentially tune reactions in the cell based on particle size. This tuning of rheology makes induction of a stress response gene more robust to osmotic pressure.

We sought to understand the evolution of kinase specificity using the CMGC (Cdk1. MAPK. Gsk. CK) family as a model. This family has undergone dramatic functional diversification and therefore represents a useful model for kinase evolution. We have reconstructed the ancestral sequences for the entire CMGC kinase tree using a maximum likelihood method. We have synthesized. purified and profiled the specificities of the common ancestor of the CMGC family; and several ancestors leading to the Cdk1 paralog. Ime2. Our results indicate that the common ancestor of all CMGC kinases recognized the consensus sequence R‐P‐x‐S/T‐P.

Here we have taken a multidisciplinary approach to review the current understanding of element incorporation into biomineralized structures in fishes. Biominerals are primarily composed of calcium-based derivatives such as calcium carbonate found in otoliths and calcium phosphates found in scales. fins and bones. By focusing on non-essential life elements (strontium and barium) and essential life elements (calcium. zinc and magnesium). we attempt to connect several fields of study to synergise how physiology may influence biomineralization and subsequent inference of life history.

Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat,The population of Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma malma) from the Big Fish River. Northwest Territories was assessed using mark-recapture. biological. genetic. and harvest data. Markrecapture studies conducted in the fall of 2009. 2010 and 2011 indicate there are between 1.477 and 7.265 anadromous Dolly Varden≥ 365 mm present at the spawning and overwintering site. The stock appears to have a low and stable abundance. which has not changed considerably over the past 20 years. Counts of migrating Dolly Varden collected using a DIDSON camera in the summer of 2010 likely underestimated abundance due to timing of camera deployment. Microsatellite data were used to determine that the effective population size (NE) was between 210 and 615 adults. suggesting current estimated abundance is sufficient to maintain long-term genetic sustainability. Two independent abundance calculations were done using the NE data which produced estimates between 1.500 and 4.393 fish. similar to the mark-recapture estimates. Biological data collected in the fall at the spawning and overwintering area found an increase in both the proportion of spawning males and those≥ 550 mm compared to previous surveys in the 1980s and 1990s. Data from recaptured fish indicates that growth has also not changed significantly from past surveys.

A decoupling was detected during first ocean migration where fish growth was occurring at a greater rate than otolith growth. Because of this decoupling. the application of traditional back-calculation models overestimated the size-at-age in premigratory char. We developed modified back-calculation equations from existing traditional models to account for this decoupling based on discontinuous piecewise regressions. The new biological intercept breakpoint method (BI–BP) provided the most accurate representation of fish size-at-age throughout all life history stages when compared with known size-at-capture values in fish.

SK glucose isomerase (SKGI) were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and homology modelling. The Cys306 to Ala mutation within SKGI dramatically affected its thermal stability by decreasing the half-life from 80 to 15 min at 90°C while the Ala63 to Ser replacement shifted this half-life to 65 min. The electrophoretic analysis proves that the residue Cys306 participates in oligomerization of the SKGI. Its stabilizing role is materialized by hydrogen bonds established with arginines at positions 284 and 259. as deduced from the constructed three-dimensional model.

As a consequence. fish populations remain fragmented. and a new interpopulational structure may develop. with increased risk of reduced genetic diversity and stochastic extinction. In order to evaluate the effects of the Gavião Peixoto Dam. which was constructed almost a century ago on the Jacaré-Guaçu River in the Upper Paraná River basin.

The present study investigated spatial patterns of richness. composition. and abundance of native (non-migratory and migratory) and non-native fishes in the cascade of reservoirs along the Paranapanema River. The study is based on data collected from 34 independent studies conducted in nine reservoirs (47 samples). The compilation recorded 161 species. being 111 native (14 migratory) and 50 non-native. Total richness ranged between 56 and 112 species/reservoir. with a mean of 72 (49.9 non-migratory. 8.1 migratory and 14 non-native). The number of non-migratory species showed no spatial trend along the cascade system. but migratory and non-native richness increased toward downstream reaches. We also observed spatial variation in species composition along the cascade system. but some non-native fishes were widely distributed. Migratory fishes showed low relative abundance (usually < 10%). while non-native species were common and more abundant. especially in reservoirs downstream.

Samplings were carried out three times on a diel cycle. in three sampling periods. two in the warm season and one in the cold season of 2008 - 2009. The ladder was closed and emptied and the entire fish assemblage was sampled and identified. Most individuals were released alive downstream of the dam. The assemblage found in the ladder was compared with the fish fauna sampled in the reservoir and in downstream sites. in the same period. Twenty seven species and a total of 4682 individuals were caught in the ladder. Pimelodus maculatus was the only migratory species. which was caught in low number in the ladder (0.04% of the total captured). where small sedentary species predominated. The most abundant species were the non-migratory Apareiodon affinis. Bryconamericus stramineus. Astyanax fasciatus and Parodon nasus. Individuals observed in the ladder's window were moving up- and down the passage. The fish ladder is a microhabitat inhabited by an abundant association of benthic organisms that is probably used as a food resource for the fish assemblage in the ladder.

The juveniles were caught in macrophytes of the littoral zone by a rectangular sieve. in the dry season of 2008 and 2009; Results: The species Astyanax altiparanae thrived similarly in the four habitats. and A. fasciatus. Hyphessobrycon eques. Hoplias malabaricus andSerrapinnus notomelas. showed higher values of relative condition factors in the reservoir and in the lake. Among the species. A. fasciatus showed the highest values of the relative condition factor in these two habitats; Conclusions: It is likely that the complexity of the macrophytes’ stands and the current velocity were the main factors influencing the development of juveniles. It was found that a lower current velocity can propitiated the establishment of a greater richness of macrophytes. which in turn can influence positively the development of fish juveniles.

The diet of specimens in different ontogenetic stages was compared. as well as their teeth morphology and ecomorphological attributes. Leporinus reticulatus presented omnivorous diet. with higher consumption of invertebrates by smaller specimens (younger ones). and gradual introduction of plant items in larger specimens (older ones). The items consumed by the individuals and the ecomorphological attributes indicated that the species is generalist and opportunistic. besides its association with the river bottom. evidencing a benthic feeding behavior. This species presents a gradual ontogenetic modification in teeth shape and mouth positioning. ranging from a terminal mouth with tricuspid teeth. in smaller specimens. to an inferior mouth with spatula shaped teeth with no cusps. in larger specimens.The ecomorphological attributes indicate an increasing swimming efficiency. and ability for performing vertical displacements. along the ontogenetic development. which in addition to the morphological ontogenetic alterations in the buccal apparatus. contributes to a better ability to explore another niches.,True,fS2zxIAAAAAJ:IUKN3-7HHlwC,7,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0044-59672015000400383&script=sci_arttext,16396095766379217299,/scholar?cites=16396095766379217299,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0044-59672015000400383&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

ABCD2 (D2) is a peroxisomal long-chain acyl-CoA transporter that is highly induced by fenofibrate in the livers of mice. To determine whether D2 is a modifier of fibrate responses. wild-type and D2-deficient mice were treated with fenofibrate for 14 days. The absence of D2 altered expression of gene clusters associated with lipid metabolism. including PPARα signaling. Using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. which express high levels of D2. we confirmed that knockdown of D2 modified genomic responses to fibrate treatment. We next evaluated the impact of D2 on effects of fibrates in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.

Gh. Asachi Technical University,It is acknowledged that organic fertilizers and wastes. such as animal slurries/manure from intensive farm enterprise. sewage sludge. poultry litter are and will continue to be spread on agricultural land and provide beneficial nutrients to crops. However. many of these materials which are also potentially polluting if not properly managed can pose a risk to groundwater and surface water quality. Generally. their distribution on the soil is performed with specialized machines to reduce the risk of overdosing (pollution) or underdosing (inefficiency) with material. For these machines to be properly dimensioned it is necessary to create mathematical models that take into account the factors that influence the distribution of the material on the soil and which can be validated experimentally.This paper presents a mathematical model for organic waste (manure) movement containing second and first derivatives. based on force equilibrium. For simplicity. we divided the path of the material point into two parts: the first part consists of curved surface (helicoid). the second part consists of a parabolic one described in the air. The two movements are studied separately considering that particle position and speed at the end of motion should be the initial conditions of motion for the second path. There are taken into consideration the relations between design parameters of the distribution machine and the material used. relations that have logical-mathematical and theoretical foundations in classical mechanics. Also. an equation that is used to calculate the necessary time for the manure to reach the soil is given together with different working hypotheses.,True,Dz9S0w4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicoleta_Ungureanu/publication/324149603_Mathematical_model_for_particle_motion_applied_on_a_manure_spreading_apparatus_used_in_environmentally_friendly_technology/links/5c5ec4bda6fdccb608b2e279/Mathematical-model-for-particle-motion-applied-on-a-manure-spreading-apparatus-used-in-environmentally-friendly-technology.pdf,12516011881586202845,/scholar?cites=12516011881586202845,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicoleta_Ungureanu/publication/324149603_Mathematical_model_for_particle_motion_applied_on_a_manure_spreading_apparatus_used_in_environmentally_friendly_technology/links/5c5ec4bda6fdccb608b2e279/Mathematical-model-for-particle-motion-applied-on-a-manure-spreading-apparatus-used-in-environmentally-friendly-technology.pdf,0,0,0

Although challenging. RNA-seq is particularly promising for research on non-model. secretive species that cannot be observed in nature easily and therefore remain comparatively understudied. Among such animals. the caecilians (order Gymnophiona) likely constitute the least known group of vertebrates. despite being an old and remarkably distinct lineage of amphibians.

Populations of C. islandicus are highly structured geographically and genetically. The COI and 16S mitochondrial genes confine six monophyletic groups which have diverged for up to 5 million years within Iceland. and may present two cryptic species. To investigate the potential cryptic species status we analyse here the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) and compare its variation with the patterns obtained with the mtDNA. The ITS regions present much less divergence among the geographic regions in comparison with the mtDNA. distances based on ITS1 are correlated with the COI distances as well as with geographic distances. but most of the variation is observed within individuals. The variation in the ITS region appears to have been shaped both by homogenization effect of concerted evolution and …,True,7Ibg0ngAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,9,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00239-011-9455-2.pdf,14476472255276410729,/scholar?cites=14476472255276410729,,https://www.academia.edu/download/61041963/s00239-011-9455-220191028-28639-13euxwx.pdf,0,0,0

Molecular analyses suggest that the genus Crangonyx is paraphyletic. with the species that is found in Eurasia being highly divergent genetically from the species present in North America and Iceland. Studies of the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Niphargus also warrant further work. The nuclear ITS2 region has recently been proposed as a barcoding marker for plants and animals.

In parallel. HERV‐derived sequences were reported to drive gene expression.

We find that HERV‐derived sequences are in general counter‐selected at regulatory regions. a counter‐selection that is strongest in brain tissues while very moderate in stem cells. By exposing T cells to the pesticide dieldrin. we further found that a series of HERV‐driven enhancers otherwise active only at stem cell stages can be reactivated by stress.

Subspecies of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) have evolved marked differences in plumage coloration since the Last Glacial Maximum. yet whether color differences are caused by mutations in coding regions of expressed genes or are instead the result of regulatory differences remains unknown. To address this question. we studied the pigment composition and the genetic basis of coloration in two divergent subspecies. the slate-colored and Oregon juncos. We used HPLC and light microscopy to investigate pigment composition and deposition in feathers from four body areas. We then used RNAseq to compare the relative roles of differential gene expression in developing feathers and sequence divergence in transcribed loci under common garden conditions. Junco feathers differed in eumelanin and pheomelanin content and distribution. Within subspecies. in lighter feathers melanin synthesis genes were downregulated (including PMEL. TYR. TYRP1. OCA2. MLANA). ASIP was upregulated. Feathers from different body regions also showed differential expression of HOX and Wnt genes. Feathers from the same body regions that differed in color between the two subspecies showed differential expression of ASIP and three other genes (MFSD12. KCNJ13.

Both Dsk2 and Rad23 function as adaptors to target ubiquitin-labelled proteins to the proteasome through recognition of polyubiquitin (four or more K48-linked ubiquitins) by their UBA domains and to the yeast proteasomal subunit Rpn1 by their UBL domains. The crystal structures of the Dsk2 UBL domain. the Dsk2 UBA domain and the Dsk2 UBA–UBL complex are reported. In the crystal. the Dsk2 UBA domains associate through electrostatic interactions to form ninefold helical ribbons that leave the ubiquitin-binding surface exposed.

This study shows that both hypoxia and X irradiation of serum-deprived Chinese hamster V79 cells cause the induction and phosphorylation of the PKC-α isoform. The increased induction and phosphorylation of PKC occur mainly in the nuclear fraction. Unlike the PKC activator TPA. neither hypoxic nor radiation stress causes translocation of PKC-α from the cytosol to the membrane. The induction of PKC-α by hypoxia is accompanied by an increased expression of MAP kinase but. in contrast. this does not occur when PKC-α is induced by radiation.

Hypxia caused an increase in xanthine oxidase activity from 25% to 80% of the total activity of xanthine oxidase and dehydrogennase. The ratio returned to normal levels within 24 h of aerobic incubation. Hypoxia caused the release of xanthine oxidase in the medium of V79 cells and an increase in total protein concentration in the medium. There was an early change induced in lipid peroxidation markers and this was inhibited by allopurinol. The effects of glucose deprivation and calcium blockers were also inevestigated.

Their study in different environments can shed light on effects of environment on bird behaviour. Therefore. the start of singing of house sparrows was studied all year round in a university housing compound with almost zero traffic noise in an arid dry desert climate. Sparrows start dawn chorus unusually early towards the end of January which is marked by increasing ambient temperatures and photoperiod and also coincides with the breeding season. Evidence that daily start of singing is directly and significantly influenced by major daily fluctuations in temperature during January and February is shown. Birds continue with early singing from March until July regardless of minor temperature fluctuations. Sparrows revert to late singing towards end of July. July is marked by the beginning of decreasing photoperiod but has no substantial fluctuations in temperature. The effect of climate on start of singing is discussed. This investigation is only concerned and concentrates on the shifting from normal start of singing to very early singing in spring season. It is concluded that early singing is initiated by increasing temperatures and is susceptible to daily fluctuations only early in the season and that these birds must have evolved to start their daily activities by singing early and foraging before temperature becomes very hot upon sunrise.,True,xaYmWz4AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1045.1722&rep=rep1&type=pdf,18312962465232146874,/scholar?cites=18312962465232146874,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1045.1722&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We have evaluated the performance of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in estimating Wuchereria bancrofti infection in pools of Culex pipiens (1–25 females) from 2 adjacent villages with high (El Qolzom. 10 · 8%) and low (Kafr Shorafa. 2 · 1%) prevalence rates of human filariasis. This assay detects a repeated sequence in W. bancrofti deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Mosquitoes resting within houses were captured by aspiration and pooled by house. Houses were classified as positive or negative for human filarial infection based on night blood examinations of residents.

Medical Entomology & Parasitology",1,1-10,Egyptian Society of Biological Sciences,This study concerns with the effects of Warfarin rodenticide on development and survival of some fly maggots. Maggots were collected off warfarin intoxicated and non-toxicated rabbits. These were laboratory reared on tissues of control rabbits.  Other group of control larvae was reared on pieces of beef mixed with 19 different concentrations of Warfarin. Intoxicated larvae of both groups had shorter developmental periods from first instar larvae to pupae indicating faster development of these larvae as compared to control ones. The overall duration periods (first instar larvae to Adults) for the fly species resulted from larvae fed rabbit tissues (specially Lucilia sericata. Chrysomya albiceps and C. megacephala) generally indicate faster development of intoxicated larvae than control ones (P˂0.01).  The different Warfarin concentrations had its effects on emerged adults:  (1) 52.63% of larvae that were exposed to 20 to 200 ppm failed to complete its development to adult stage.

We previously reported that P. parva accumulates high amounts of arginine with the key enzyme of the ornithine/arginine biosynthesis pathway. N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase. exhibiting high activity. Here we demonstrate that l-arginine can be used by this alga as a nitrogen source. Externally supplied arginine directly influenced the levels of PII signaling protein and formation of triacylglycerol (TAG)-filled lipid bodies (LBs).

This is one of the major problems preventing the assessment and effectiveness of conservation actions. Mega-diverse tropical regions are being exposed to fast and profound environmental changes. and the amount of resources available to describe the distribution of species is generally limited. Thus. the tropics is losing species at unprecedented rates. without a proper assessment of its biodiversity. Species distribution models (SDMs) can be used to fill such biogeographic gaps within a species’ range and. when allied with systematic conservation planning (e.g. analyses of representativeness. gap analysis). help transcend such data shortage and support practical conservation actions. Within the Neotropics. eastern Amazon and northern Cerrado present a high variety of environments and are some of the most interesting ecotonal areas within South America. but are also among the most threatened biogeographic provinces in the world. Here. we test the effectiveness of the current system of Protected Areas (PAs). in protecting 24 threatened and endemic bird species using SDMs. We found that taxa with wider distributions are potentially as protected as taxa with smaller ranges. and larger PAs were more efficient than smaller PAs. while protecting these bird species. Nonetheless. Cerrado PAs are mostly misallocated. We suggest six priority areas for conservation of Neotropical birds.

The aim of the paper was to evaluate the use of bovine array for cross-species genotyping and analyse single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution. diversity within groups of animals and genetic distance among analysed species. The number of polymorphic SNPs decreased with the increase of phylogenetic distance between species. which also reflected a decrease in call rate (from 99.54 to 61.19%). The minor allele frequency (MAF) values were significantly different between species and ranged from 0.18 ± 15 (Zebu) to 0.26 ± 0.14 (Pinzgau). The subsequent analyses of genetic diversity were based on the polymorphic loci detected in cervids. Differences in the expected heterozygosity was low (0.06). on average 0.34. In analysed groups the FIS values were close to zero. which suggested low SNP variance within them. The value of FIT indicated homozygote excess in evaluated individuals. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that most of the variability was distributed within all individuals. Observed genetic distances within and across groups of animals suggested that taurine cattle and cervids were more distant.

Genotyping data of six beef breeds (Aberdeen Angus. Hereford. Limousin. Charolais. Piedmontese and Romagnola) were used to perform genome-wide scans for selection signatures. The approaches applied were based on an assumption that selection leads to linkage disequilibrium or to a decrease of genetic variability in genomic regions containing genotypes connected with favourable phenotypes. Thus. the selection signatures were analysed based on Wright’s FST index. distribution of runs of homozygosity segments in the beef genome and determination of linkage disequilibrium variability between breeds. The number and length of detected selection signals were different depending on the breeds and methodological approaches. As expected due to the breeding goals of analysed breeds. common signals were located on autosomes 2. 6. 7. 13 and 20 close to the genes associated with coat colour (KIT. KDR). muscle development (GDF9. GHRH. GHR). double muscling (MSTN). meat tenderness (CAST) and intramuscular fat content (SCD).

Raw sheep milk. cow milk and heat-treated cow milk (pasteurisation at 72 C for 15 sec or at 85 C for 3 sec) were mixed in precisely defined proportions (0-100% cow milk in sheep milk).

By ELISA tests was possible to determine these amounts of raw cow milk in sheep milk: 0.5%(0.2%). 5%(4.81%). 50%(42.08%) and 75%(56.52%). The pasteurized samples in different combinations gave lower optical density responses than those prepared from raw milk (by approximately 60%). In context with the above mentioned. the relationship between the real and detected amount of cow milk (%) in different production stages (milk. cheese) using a regression analysis was examined. However. a lower reliability of the detection was indicated by R2 values. which ranged from 0.4058 (cheese) to 0.5175 (milk).

Iran,A territorial isolation is a danger to the game population. causing deterioration called the inbreeding depression. The typical signs are anomalous body proportions. such as short lower jaw. shortened lifetime. weak physique and lower birth rate. This is caused by low number of game in the community. White colored deer is in the location of the Czech Republic bred in separation since 18th century. For their preservation. it was necessary to refresh the population by'wild colored'Cervus elaphus. By this way. it was reduced the in-breeding depression and population was saved. Simultaneously white colored. beige colored. red colored. combined colored and spotted individuals started to appear. For further breeding development (retention of good health condition. fertility. inbreeding reduction and increase of white colored deer population). practical exploitation of molecular genetics methods were made by deer identification and verification of family relationships. Proven results were used for compilation of breeding groups with target of gradual reduction in: inbreeding. negative consequences of inbreeding depression and increase of white deer population (the origin from Kashmir or Persia).

A mother is expected to trade-off allocation to size. number. and sex of offspring to maximize her lifetime reproductive success. Optimal allocation is likely affected by ecological conditions that can alter the costs and benefits of different allocation decisions. When resources are rare. mothers have fewer resources to invest in offspring. likely altering optimal resource allocation. We examined maternal resource allocation to progeny under three different resource levels in semifield conditions for the solitary bee Megachile rotundata (Fabricius).

Protection provides offspring with a greater chance of surviving to be able to reproduce. while at the same time. often posing a cost to the parent. Therefore. the net value of defence for the parent can vary depending on the developmental stage of the offspring and their ability to defend themselves. For example. in commonly studied organisms (e.g. birds). defence level increases over time until offspring are able to leave the nest and parental defence wanes. We examine these nest defence decisions in the solitary bee system that poses an interesting variation to traditionally studied organisms. Nest value does not increase in a simple additive manner as offspring are added to the nest. Here. individual investments are allocated to each offspring. then as a final act. the nest entrance is sealed.

1062614,Maternal allocation decisions impacted by variable ecological conditions in a solitary bee: behavioural ecology perspectives,2010,Jason Harvey Peterson,,,,,,Parents can invest in offspring through a variety of behaviours. I use a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to examine how resource and sex allocation decisions toward offspring were altered in response to changing ecological conditions. My empirical work was done using the haplodiploid alfalfa leafcutter bee (Megachile rotundata). where sex of offspring can be controlled and mothers do all offspring provisioning. My theoretical research demonstrated no single factor determining sex allocation; instead. there is some ‘optimal balance’between factors. Empirical work results suggest a similar situation. All three experiments demonstrated different factors that impacted sex allocation decisions: flight distance to resources. resource levels. and local population density. Longer flight distances resulted in fewer offspring produced throughout the season. but a greater proportion of daughters produced in the first half of the season and a lower proportion of daughters in the second half of the season compared to mothers with short distance to resources. Lower resource-level treatments had similar effects during the first half of the season as with long flight distance; however. during the second half mothers continued to produce a greater proportion of daughters under low resource conditions compared to high. Lower local population density resulted in both a greater proportion of daughters being produced as well as a greater number of offspring per individual nest compared with high-density conditions.

In mouse cultured astrocytes. we detected GPR35 transcript using RT-PCR and we found that KYNA (0.1 to 100 µM) decreased forskolin (FRSK)-induced cAMP production (p<0.05). Both CID2745687 (3 µM. CID). a recently described GPR35 antagonist. and GPR35 gene silencing significantly prevented the action of KYNA on FRSK-induced cAMP production. In these cultures. we then evaluated whether GPR35 activation was able to modulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i ) and [Ca2+]i fluxes. We found that both KYNA and zaprinast. a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor and GPR35 agonist. did not modify either basal or peaks of [Ca2+]i induced by challenging the cells with ATP (30 µM). However. the [Ca2+]i plateau phase following peak was significantly attenuated by these compounds in a store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOC)-independent manner. The activation of GPR35 by KYNA and zaprinast was also studied at the CA3-CA1 synapse in the rat hippocampus. Evoked excitatory post synaptic currents (eEPSCs) were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices. The action of KYNA on GPR35 was pharmacologically isolated by using NMDA and α7 nicotinic receptor blockers and resulted in a significant reduction of eEPSC amplitude. This effect was prevented in the presence of CID. Moreover. zaprinast reduced eEPSC amplitude in a PDE5- and cGMP-independent mechanism. thus suggesting that glutamatergic transmission in this area is modulated by GPR35.

Although they do not generate action potentials. they nonetheless exhibit electrical activity and can influence surrounding neurons through gliotransmitter release. In this work. we explored whether optogenetic activation of glial cells could act as an amplification mechanism to optical neural stimulation via gliotransmission to the neural network. We studied the modulation of gliotransmission by selective photo-activation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and by means of a matrix of individually addressable super-bright microLEDs (μLEDs) with an excitation peak at 470 nm. We combined Ca2+ imaging techniques and concurrent patch-clamp electrophysiology to obtain subsequent glia/neural activity. First. we tested the μLEDs efficacy in stimulating ChR2-transfected astrocyte. ChR2-induced astrocytic current did not desensitize overtime. and was linearly increased and prolonged by increasing μLED irradiance in terms of intensity and surface illumination. Subsequently. ChR2 astrocytic stimulation by broad-field LED illumination with the same spectral profile. increased both glial cells and neuronal calcium transient frequency and sEPSCs suggesting that few ChR2-transfected astrocytes were able to excite surrounding not-ChR2-transfected astrocytes and neurons. Finally. by using the μLEDs array to selectively light stimulate ChR2 positive astrocytes we were able to increase the synaptic activity of single neurons surrounding it. In conclusion. ChR2-transfected astrocytes and μLEDs system were shown to be an amplifier of synaptic …,True,MWBr2X8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,19,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108689,5293689657496939316,/scholar?cites=5293689657496939316,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108689,0,0,0

As a consequence. the system would not benefit from additional connections in terms of the amount of I(Q). in agreement with the tendency of brains to minimize Q because of its energetic costs.

Neuroprotective treatments are virtually unavailable. partly because of the marked internal heterogeneity of the mechanisms underlying pathology. Targeted neuroprotection would require deep mechanistic knowledge across the entire aetiological spectrum of each NDD and the development of tailored treatments. Although ideal. this strategy appears challenging. as it would require a degree of characterization of both the disease and the patient that is currently unavailable.

Here. we show that such waves initiate at pacemakers. regions that oscillate faster than their surroundings. In cell-free extracts of Xenopus laevis eggs. we find that nuclei define such pacemakers by concentrating cell cycle regulators. In computational models of diffusively coupled oscillators that account for nuclear import. nuclear positioning determines the pacemaker location. Furthermore. we find that the spatial dimensions of the oscillatory medium change the nuclear positioning and strongly influence whether a pacemaker is more likely to be at a boundary or an internal region. Finally. we confirm experimentally that increasing the system width increases the proportion of pacemakers at the boundary.

Thus. polysaccharides can contribute to significantly overcome the limitation in the use of many types of drugs. including anti-cancer drugs. The use of conventional anti-cancer drugs is hampered by their high toxicity. mostly depending on the indiscriminate targeting of both cancer and normal cells. Additionally. for nucleic acid based drugs (NABDs). an emerging class of drugs with potential anti-cancer value. the practical use is problematic. This mostly depends on their fast degradation in biological fluids and the difficulties to cross cell membranes.

In the equatorial Andes. most lakes have traditionally been described as having waters that circulate continuously (polymictic). with only rare episodes of stratification. This characterization. albeit based on relatively few studies. is widely accepted. despite accelerated regional warming over the past 30 years. Here. we show that protracted periods of thermal stratification are presently the norm. not the exception. in equatorial mountain lakes. Annual circulation and stratification patterns recorded in four lakes from Ecuador’s southern Sierra show extended periods of stratification. which are stable and do not break down with nocturnal cooling. These data contrast with earlier research from this region. which reported full water column mixing and only infrequent stratification. but are not surprising in light of recent trends toward rising temperatures and declining wind velocities. Paleolimnological studies show that changes to the thermal regimes of these lakes likely began several decades ago and have resulted in ecosystem-scale changes including regime shifts in phytoplankton and declines in aquatic production,True,pWJQnv8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,35,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1d2f/c4e483ff643fd66852a63d9f8642d8556fd7.pdf,4545769468094974768,/scholar?cites=4545769468094974768,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1d2f/c4e483ff643fd66852a63d9f8642d8556fd7.pdf,0,0,0

These large colonies of birds now often conflict with socioeconomic interests. particularly due to perceived competition with fisheries and the destruction of terrestrial vegetation in nesting habitats. Here we use dated sediment cores from ponds on islands in eastern Lake Ontario that receive waste inputs from dense colonies of cormorants and ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) to chronicle the population rise of these species and assess their long-term ecological impacts. Modern water chemistry sampling from these sites reveals drastically elevated nutrient and major ion concentrations compared to reference ponds not influenced by waterbirds. Geochemical tracers in dated sediment cores. particularly δ15N and chlorophyll-a concentrations. track waterbird influences over time. Fossil diatom assemblages were dominated by species tolerant of hyper-eutrophic and polluted systems. which is in marked contrast to assemblages in reference sites. In addition to establishing long-term ecological impacts. this multi-proxy paleoecological approach can be used to determine whether islands of concern have been long-term nesting sites or were only recently colonized by cormorant or ring-billed gull populations across the Great Lakes. facilitating informed management decisions about controversial culling programs.,True,pWJQnv8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,14,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134167,3500348087635061491,/scholar?cites=3500348087635061491,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134167,0,0,0

DNA arrays have been employed to monitor gene expression patterns in testis of mice exposed to tobacco smoke for 24 weeks and compared to control animals. The results of the analysis revealed significant changes in expression of several genes that may have a role in spermatogenesis. Cdk14 was chosen for further characterization because of a suggested role in the testis and in regulation of Wnt signaling. RT-PCR analysis confirmed down regulation of Cdk14 in mice exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). Cdk14 is expressed in all testicular cells; spermatogonia- and Sertoli-derived cell lines treated with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) in vitro showed down-regulation of CDK14 mRNA and protein levels as well as down-regulation of β-catenin levels.

A quick summary,2015,Yuxuan Xiao and Daniel Pollack and Edward Nieves and Aby Winchell and Myrasol Callaway and Margarita Vigodner,,,,,,30 A diverse set of SUMO target proteins has been identified. Therefore. there is a growing interest in 31 studying sumoylation and SUMO interactions in cells. When the sumoylation of a protein or a SUMO 32 interaction is suspected. a standard co-immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-SUMO and anti-target 33 protein antibody is usually performed as a first step. However. the identification of endogenous sumoy-34 lated proteins is challenging because of the activity of isopeptidases. and often only a small fraction of a 35 target protein is sumoylated at a given time.

As intra- and interspecific relationships are manifold and often vary in terms of fitness consequences for the interacting species. it can be hypothesized that responses to corpses of different origin can vary.

In our study. we investigated the structure of ant assemblages in plantations of different aged poplar forests (Populus alba) infested with the invasive common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca). Our results showed that the dispersion pattern of colonies was mostly regular with higher interspecific neighbour distances in the younger forests and higher intraspecific neighbour distances in the older forests. In the younger forests. most colonies nested in milkweed stems. while in the older forests colonies used more types of nesting sites and were mostly found in the soil and litter. These findings suggest that depending on whether suitable sites for nesting are limited or not. the importance of intra-and interspecific competition may vary among the different aged forests.

In the present study. we explored the effect of a bioactive peptide (PAP) on angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertrophy and associated ventricular arrhythmias in in vitro and in vivo models. PAP enhances p21 activated kinase 1 (Pak1) activity by increasing the level of phosphorylated Pak1 in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). Such PAP-induced Pak1 activation is associated with a significant reduction of Ang II-induced hypertrophy in NRVMs and C57BL/6 mice. in vitro and in vivo. respectively. Furthermore. PAP antagonizes ventricular arrhythmias associated with Ang II-induced hypertrophy in mice. Its antiarrhythmic effect is likely to be involved in multiple mechanisms to affect both substrate and trigger of ventricular arrhythmogenesis.

This  Ca2+-mobilising molecule is known to play a role in modulating cardiac  excitation-contraction coupling and pathophysiology.The first part of the thesis focuses on understanding the mechanistic details of  NAADP actions. particularly during the flight and fight response of the heart.  Paced ventricular myocytes. which had genetically- (Tpcn2-/-) or  pharmacologically-impaired (bafilomycin-A1 treatment) NAADP signalling  pathways. had blunted responses to isoprenaline. Further investigations revealed  that NAADP actions are dependent of functional CaMKII proteins but independent  of L-type Ca2+ channels.The main part of the thesis focuses on understanding the enzymatic production of  NAADP in the heart. Although CD38. which belongs to the ADP-ribosyl cyclase  (ARC) family. has been shown to catalyse the synthesis of NAADP in other  mammalian tissue. whether CD38 is responsible for the production of NAADP in  the heart remains debatable. Membrane fractions from CD38-/- mouse hearts were  not able to generate NAADP through catalysing the base-exchange reaction.

They have been implicated in the origin of new molecular functions and in some cases. new phenotypes. Yet. the processes that lead to their evolution and how they enter the genome of their hosts remain largely underexplored. The P-element is one of the most well-known TEs in Eukaryotes. due to its rapid expansion in Drosophila melanogaster in the 1960s and its faster invasion of D. simulans. despite its fitness consequences in both species. Here. we describe a recent invasion of P-elements into Drosophila yakuba. Overall. PEs were found in D. yakuba with no PEs detected across its sister species. D. teissieri and D. santomea. These findings are surprising due the lack of a genetic bridge between D. yakuba and other Drosophila that harbor PEs. implicating a horizontal gene transfer mechanism similar to the one that gave rise to the invasion of PEs in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We also report that the presence of these PEs causes a mild hybrid dysgenesis phenomenon; namely they cause a reduction in female reproductive potential (lower number of ovaries and ovarioles). but only at 29°C and not at 23°C.

1062697,The genetics of adaptation in Drosophila sechellia,2013,Eric Jay Earley,,,,,,Drosophila sechellia. an ecological specialist on the ripe fruit of Morinda citrifolia (Morinda). displays a suite of adaptations which allow it to both prefer and tolerate Morinda and its toxic compounds. Other Drosophilids. like D. melanogaster. find Morinda repellent and toxic. Despite years of effort to dissect the genetic basis of this behavioral and physiological divergence. we still do not understand what genes allow D. sechellia to prefer and tolerate Morinda and what genes drive aversion in other species. In this dissertation I dissect the genetic basis of preference and tolerance using both traditional genetic and molecular tools along with new whole genome sequencing methods. I find that preference is genetically complex (Chapter Two). requiring up to 27 different genetic loci (Chapter Three). At the same time. however. a gene expressed in the fly's peripheral nervous system. gustatory receptor 22c. Gr22c. is responsible for nearly 50% of the transition between aversion and preference (Chapter Four). Surprisingly. extant D. sechellia Gr22c is likely a pseudogene. suggesting that preference evolution proceeded in two steps: loss of aversion then gain of preference. Finally. I. along with collaborators. introgress D. sechellia Morinda tolerance factors into a D. simulans genome and identify 17 candidate genes. among then three Odorant binding proteins (Chapter Five). We find that tolerance alone is not enough to confer altered behavior. conflicting with evolutionary models that predict preference and tolerance loci would evolve to be genetically linked.

The Australasian elapid snake radiation. which includes approximately 100 terrestrial species in Australia. as well as Melanesian species and all the world's true sea snakes. may be less than 12 million years old.. The incredible phenotypic and ecological diversity of the clade is matched by considerable diversity in venom composition. The clade’s evolutionary youth and dynamic evolution should make it of particular interest to toxinologists. however. the majority of species. which are small. typically inoffensive. and seldom encountered by non-herpetologists. have been almost completely neglected by researchers. The present study investigates the venom composition of 28 species proteomically. revealing several interesting trends in venom composition. and reports. for the first time in elapid snakes. the existence of an ontogenetic shift in the venom composition and activity of brown snakes (Pseudonaja sp.).

A new species of taipan. the Western Desert Taipan (Oxyuranus temporalis). has been discovered with two specimens housed in captivity at the Adelaide Zoo. This study is the first investigation of O. temporalis venom and seeks to characterise and compare the neurotoxicity. lethality and biochemical properties of O. temporalis venom with other taipan venoms. Analysis of O. temporalis venom using size-exclusion and reverse-phase HPLC indicated a markedly simplified “profile” compared to other taipan venoms. SDS-PAGE and agarose gel electrophoresis analysis also indicated a relatively simple composition. Murine LD 50 studies showed that O. temporalis venom is less lethal than O. microlepidotus venom. Venoms were tested in vitro. using the chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation. Based on t 90 values. O. temporalis venom is highly neurotoxic abolishing indirect twitches far more rapidly than other taipan venoms. O. temporalis venom also abolished responses to exogenous acetylcholine and carbachol. indicating the presence of postsynaptic neurotoxins. Prior administration of CSL Taipan antivenom (CSL Limited) neutralised the inhibitory effects of all taipan venoms. The results of this study suggest that the venom of the O. temporalis is highly neurotoxic in vitro and may contain procoagulant toxins. making this snake potentially dangerous to humans.

However. progress in this area is hampered by the lack of a high-throughput. cost-effective. and taxonomically flexible platform. Current methods are low-throughput. consume large quantities of sample. or are taxonomically limited in which targets can be tested. We describe a novel assay which utilizes a label-free bio-layer interferometry technology. in combination with adapted mimotope peptides. in order to measure ligand binding to the orthosteric site of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunits of diverse organisms. We validated the method by testing the evolutionary patterns of a generalist feeding species (Acanthophis antarcticus). a fish specialist species (Aipysurus laevis). and a snake specialist species (Ophiophagus hannah) for comparative binding to the orthosteric site of fish. amphibian. lizard. snake. bird. marsupial. and rodent alpha-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Binding patterns corresponded with diet. with the Acanthophis antarcticus not showing bias towards any particular lineage. while Aipysurus laevis showed selectivity for fish. and Ophiophagus hannah a selectivity for snake. To validate the biodiscovery potential of this method. we screened Acanthophis antarcticus and Tropidolaemus wagleri venom for binding to human alpha-1. alpha-2. alpha-3. alpha-4. alpha-5. alpha-6. alpha-7. alpha-9. and alpha-10.

Previously the mechanism of action of the PLA2 toxins’ anticoagulant toxicity was said to be due to inhibition of Factor Xa. but this statement was evidence free. We conducted a series of anticoagulation assays to elucidate the mechanism of anticoagulant action produced by P. australis venom. Our results revealed that. rather than targeting FXa. the PLA2 toxins inhibited the prothrombinase complex. with FVa—alone or as part of the prothrombinase complex—as the primary target; but with significant thrombin inhibition also noted.

As a single marker. PSA provides limited diagnostic information. A multi-marker test capable of detecting not only tumors but also the potentially lethal ones provides an unmet clinical need. Using the nanoString nCounter gene expression system. a 20-gene multiplex test was developed based on digital gene counting of RNA transcripts in urine as a means to detect prostate cancer. In this test. voided urine is centrifuged to pellet cells and the purified RNA is amplified for hybridization to preselected probesets. Amplification of test cell line RNA appeared not to introduce significant bias. and the counts matched well with gene abundance levels as measured by DNA microarrays. For data analysis. the individual counts were compared to that of β2 microglobulin. a housekeeping gene. Urine samples of 5 pre-operative cases and 2 non-cancer were analyzed. Pathology information was then retrieved. Signals for a majority of the genes were low for non-cancer and low Gleason scores. and 6/6 known prostate cancer markers were positive in the cases. One case of Gleason 4+5 showed. in contrast. strong signals for all cancer-associated markers. including CD24. One non-cancer also showed signals for all 6 cancer markers. and this man might harbor an undiagnosed cancer.

The Sarbecovirus accessory protein ORF6 has previously been shown to be the major inhibitor of interferon production in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was recently shown to co-purify with the host mRNA export factors Rae1 and Nup98. Here. we demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 strongly represses protein expression of co-transfected reporter constructs and imprisons host mRNA in the nucleus. which is associated with its ability to co-purify with Rae1 and Nup98. These protein-protein interactions map to the C-terminus of ORF6 and can be abolished by a single amino acid mutation in Met58. Overexpression of Rae1 restores reporter expression in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6. We further identify an ORF6 mutant containing a 9-amino acid deletion. ORF6 ∆22-30. in multiple SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates that can still downregulate the expression of a co-transfected reporter and interact with Rae1 and Nup98. SARS-CoV ORF6 also interacts with Rae1 and Nup98. However. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 more strongly co-purifies with Rae1 and Nup98 and results in significantly reduced expression of reporter proteins compared to SARS-CoV ORF6. a potential mechanism for the delayed symptom onset and pre-symptomatic transmission uniquely associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.,True,pS4QhnEAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,4,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.234559v1.abstract,12820094884093853125,/scholar?cites=12820094884093853125,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/08/03/2020.08.03.234559.full.pdf,0,0,0

Weapons are specialized structures that are commonly used by animals to signal fighting ability and resource holding potential during agonistic encounters. Current theory predicts weapon size should reliably indicate weapon strength and unreliable signals should only occur at very low frequencies in nature. However. a recent study found weapon size was an unreliable signal of strength during agonistic interactions among males of the slender crayfish (Cherax dispar). 2. In this study. we investigated the relationship between morphology. performance and social dominance in females of C. dispar. Based on current theory. we predicted chela size would reliably indicate chela strength and would relate indirectly to dominance via its influence on strength. 3.

To reduce potential risks. males can use signals to convey information about their underlying strength to competitors. and although individuals could signal deceptively to gain an advantage. most signals seem to be reliable.2.Theory suggests that signal reliability is maintained because individuals that signal unreliably may be punished (i.e. receiver‐imposed costs). Manipulative studies support this idea. showing that low‐quality individuals that are given high‐quality signals bear substantial costs.3.Here. we explore the importance of receiver‐imposed costs in natural. un‐manipulated populations.

However. other than resource gains. incentives for dishonest signalling remain unexplored. In this study. we tested the idea that unreliable signallers pay lower metabolic costs for their signals. and that energetic savings could represent an incentive for cheating. We focused on two-toned fiddler crabs (Uca vomeris). a species that frequently uses its enlarged claws as signals of dominance to opponents.

Our understanding of what impedes or facilitates the use and detection of deceptive signals in humans is still largely limited to studies of verbal deception under laboratory conditions.

In this paper. we empirically test these predictions in a real-world case of human deception. simulation in soccer. In support of theoretical predictions in signalling theory. we show that cost-free deceit by soccer players decreases as the potential outcome for the signaller becomes more costly.

These signals are usually reliable indicators of an individual9s underlying quality; however. in several crustacean species. displays of weapons do not always accurately reflect the attribute being advertised. Male fiddler crabs possess one enlarged claw that is used to attract females and to intimidate opponents during territorial contests. After the loss of their major claw. males can regenerate a replacement claw that is similar in size but considerably weaker. As this inferior weapon can still be used to successfully intimidate rivals. it represents one of the clearest cases of unreliable signalling of strength during territorial contests.

In ecomorphological studies. mechanical performance is widely understood to constrain the evolution of form and function. However. the relationship between form. function. and resource utilization is less clear. Additionally. seasonal fluctuations in resource availability may further complicate patterns of resource use. How organisms cope with these complexities. and the effect of these factors on broadscale patterns of morphological evolution is also poorly understood.

Exploration of habitat effects on labrid pharyngeal jaw evolution in the era of big data,2019,Kory M Evans and Keiffer L Williams and Mark W Westneat,59,Integrative and comparative biology,3,696-704,Oxford University Press,Coral reefs are complex marine habitats that have been hypothesized to facilitate functional specialization and increased rates of functional and morphological evolution. Wrasses (Labridae: Percomorpha) in particular. have diversified extensively in these coral reef environments and have evolved adaptations to further exploit reef-specific resources. Prior studies have found that reef-dwelling wrasses exhibit higher rates of functional evolution. leading to higher functional variation than in non-reef dwelling wrasses. Here. we examine this hypothesis in the lower pharyngeal tooth plate of 134 species of reef and non-reef-associated labrid fishes using high-resolution morphological data in the form of micro-computed tomography scans and employing three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to quantify shape differences.

These differences in rates can be attributed to variation in responses to selective pressures between individual traits. Differential responses to selective pressures also have the potential to facilitate functional specialization. allowing certain traits to track environmental stimuli more closely than others. The teleost skull is a multifunctional structure comprising a complex network of bones and thus an excellent system for which to study mosaic evolution.

Here we show that two invertebrate neurohormones. octopamine and tyramine as well as their associated receptors. have a major impact on these metabolic traits. Animals devoid of the monoamine octopamine develop a severe obesity phenotype. Using flies defective in the expression of receptors for octopamine and tyramine. we aimed to decipher the contributions of single receptors for these metabolic phenotypes. Whereas those animals impaired in octß1r. octß2r. and tar1 share the obesity phenotype of octopamine deficient (tβh-deficient) animals. the octß1r. octß2r deficient flies show reduced insulin release. which is opposed to the situation found in tβh deficient animals. On the other hand. OAMB deficient flies are leaner than controls. implying that the regulation of this phenotype is more complex than anticipated. Other phenotypes seen in tβh-deficient animals. such as the reduced ability to perform complex movements tasks can mainly be attributed to the octß2r.

These different tasks are at least partially accomplished by specialized cell types in the epithelium. In addition. a proximal to distal gradient mirroring the transition from airflow conduction to real gas exchange. is also operative. We analysed the airway system of larval Drosophila melanogaster with respect to region-specific expression in the proximal to distal axis. The larval airway system is made of epithelial cells only. We found differential expression between major trunks of the airways and more distal ones comprising primary. secondary and terminal ones. A more detailed analysis was performed using DNA-microarray analysis to identify cohorts of genes that are either predominantly expressed in the dorsal trunks or in the primary/secondary/terminal branches of the airways. Among these differentially expressed genes are especially those involved in signal transduction. Wnt-signalling associated genes for example are predominantly found in secondary/terminal airways.

In mammalian systems. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). or DNA plasmids expressing these siRNAs. have been used to down-modulate gene expression. However. inefficient transfection protocols. in particular. for primary cell types. have hampered the use of these tools in disease-relevant cellular assays.

Due to increased susceptibility to sepsis in individuals with functional caspase-12. an early-stop mutation leading to the loss of caspase-12 has replaced the ancient genotype in Eurasia and a significant proportion of individuals from African populations. In African-Americans. it has been shown that caspase-12 inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine production.  Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed whether similar mechanisms are present in African individuals. and whether evolutionary pressures due to plague may have led to the present caspase-12 genotype population frequencies. No difference in cytokine induction through the caspase-1 and/or NOD2/RIP2 pathways was observed in two independent African populations. among individuals with either an intact or absent caspase-12. In addition. stimulations with Yersinia pestis and two other species of Yersinia were preformed to investigate whether caspase-12 modulates the inflammatory reaction induced by Yersinia. We found that caspase-12 did not modulate cytokine production induced by Yersinia spp.  Conclusions Our experiments demonstrate for the first time the involvement of the NOD2/RIP2 pathway for recognition of Yersinia. However. caspase-12 does not modulate innate host defense against Y. pestis and alternative explanations for the geographical distribution of caspase-12 should be sought.,True,dl1xBQwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,33,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006870,9266411404319401471,/scholar?cites=9266411404319401471,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0006870,0,0,0

Forty two wheat lines and cultivars were planted in a triple rectangular lattice design. Plants were irrigated with saline water with EC= 12 dsm-1 (moderate salinity for wheat) throughout the growing season. Grain yield and 18 agronomic traits were studied. Correlation coefficients among traits and the linear stepwise regression of grain yield on the other traits were calculated. Grain filling period and number of spikes per m 2 had the highest correlation with grain yield. In linear stepwise regression. grain filling period was the first trait that used in the regression model. Based on the variables that used in the stepwise regression model ie grain filling period. grain weight per spike. number of spikes per m 2 and plant height. also using some other traits. path coefficient anlyasis was performed. Regarding to the results. grain filling period had the highest direct effect on grain yield. and indirect effects of flag leaf area duration and peduncle length via grain filling period were high and positive. Also number of spikes per m 2 and number of kernels per spike had relatively high direct effects on grain yield. Finally. grain filling period. number of spikes per m 2 and number of kernels per spike were the most effective traits on grain yield in this experiment. Genotypes Roshan. Barekat.

Recent studies show that β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) is involved in tumor progression. playing an important role in metastasis. Among β-adrenergic receptors. β3-AR is the last identified member of this family. and it is involved in cancer cell survival and induction of stromal reactivity in the tumor microenvironment. β3-AR is well known as a strong activator of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown fat tissue. Interestingly. β3-AR is strongly expressed in early embryo development and in many cancer tissues. Induction of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been related to cancer metabolic switch. leading to accelerated glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial activity. In this study. for the first time. we demonstrate that β3-AR is able to promote this metabolic shift in both cancer and embryonic stem cells. inducing specific glycolytic cytoplasmic enzymes and a sort of mitochondrial dormancy through the induction of UCP2. The β3-AR/UCP2 axis induces a strong reduction of mitochondrial activity by reducing ATP synthesis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) content. These effects are reverted by SR59230A. the specific β3-AR antagonist. causing an increase in mtROS. The increased level of mtROS is neutralized by a strong antioxidant activity in embryonic stem cells. but not in cancer stem cells. where it causes a dramatic reduction in tumor cell viability.

These events have been invariantly related to cellular energy failure due to ATP shortage. The latter occurs because of both ATP consumption for NAD resynthesis and impairment of mitochondrial ATP formation caused by an increase of the AMP/ADP ratio. ATP depletion is therefore thought to be an inevitable consequence of NAD loss and a hallmark of PARP-1 activation. Here. we challenge this scenario by showing that PARP-1 hyperactivation in cells cultured in the absence of glucose (Glu− cells) is followed by NAD depletion and an unexpected PARP-1 activity-dependent ATP increase. We found increased ADP content in resting Glu− cells. a condition that counteracts the increase of the AMP/ADP ratio during hyperpoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and preserves mitochondrial coupling.

Examining leaf traits in relationship to the natural physical environments in which they occur can provide a detailed understanding of plant function and adaptation to a set of given environmental conditions. My research focuses on the native Euphorbia subgenus Chamaesyce of Hawaii. a group of C4 eudicots that have diversified across dramatic habitat gradients from one putative herbaceous colonizing species into 29 endemic woody taxa. within the last five million years.

L-proline has become recognized as an important metabolite for trypanosomatids. It is involved in a number of key processes. including energy metabolism. resistance to oxidative and nutritional stress and osmoregulation. In addition. this amino acid supports critical parasite life cycle processes by acting as an energy source. thus enabling host-cell invasion by the parasite and subsequent parasite differentiation. In this paper. we demonstrate that L-proline is oxidized to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by the enzyme proline dehydrogenase (TcPRODH. E.C. 1.5.99.8) localized in Trypanosoma cruzi mitochondria. When expressed in its active form in Escherichia coli. TcPRODH exhibits a Km of 16.58±1.69 µM and a Vmax of 66±2 nmol/min mg. Furthermore. we demonstrate that TcPRODH is a FAD-dependent dimeric state protein. TcPRODH mRNA and protein expression are strongly upregulated in the intracellular epimastigote. a stage which requires an external supply of proline. In addition. when Saccharomyces cerevisiae null mutants for this gene (PUT1) were complemented with the TcPRODH gene. diminished free intracellular proline levels and an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress in comparison to the null mutant were observed. supporting the hypothesis that free proline accumulation constitutes a defense against oxidative imbalance.

Sleeping sickness is another serious health problem. caused by Trypanosoma brucei. especially in sub-Saharan countries. Unfortunately. the drugs currently available to treat these diseases have toxic effects and are not effective against all disease phases or parasite strains. Therefore. there is a clear need for the development of novel drugs and drug targets to treat these diseases. We propose the trypanosome prereplication machinery component. Orc1/Cdc6. as a potential target for drug development. In trypanosomes. Orc1/Cdc6 is involved in nuclear DNA replication. and. despite its involvement in such a conserved process. Orc1/Cdc6 is distinct from mammalian Orc1 and Cdc6 proteins. Moreover.

After the spring bloom. natural plankton were enclosed and treated in duplicates with inorganic nutrients elevated to pre-bloom conditions (N. P. Si; eutrophication). lowering of 0.4 pH units (acidification). and rising 3°C temperature (warming). All nutrient-amended treatments resulted in phytoplankton blooms dominated by chain-forming diatoms. and reached 13–16 μg chlorophyll (chl) a l−1. In the control mesocosms. chl a remained below 1 μg l−1. Acidification and warming had contrasting effects on the phenology and bloom-dynamics of autotrophic and heterotrophic microplankton. Bacillariophyceae. prymnesiophyceae. cryptophyta. and Protoperidinium spp. peaked earlier at higher temperature and lower pH. Chlorophyta showed lower peak abundances with acidification. but higher peak abundances with increased temperature. The peak magnitude of autotrophic dinophyceae and ciliates was. on the other hand. lowered with combined warming and acidification. Over time. the plankton communities shifted from autotrophic phytoplankton blooms to a more heterotrophic system in all mesocosms. especially in the control unaltered mesocosms. The development of mass balance and proportion of heterotrophic/autotrophic biomass predict a shift towards a more autotrophic community and less-efficient food web transfer when temperature. nutrients and acidification are combined in a future climate-change scenario.

Here we developed a new synthesis procedure that controls certain defects in pure nZnO that are theorized to contribute to the n-type conductivity of the material. Interestingly. this procedure created defects that reduced the nanoparticle band gap to ∼3.1 eV and generated strong emissions in the violet to blue region while minimizing the defects responsible for the more commonly observed broad green emissions.

While previous studies have focused on understanding nanotoxicity effects mostly resulting from cellular internalization. recent work indicates that NMs may interfere with transmembrane transport mechanisms. hence enabling contributions to nanotoxicity by affecting key biological activities dependent on transmembrane transport. In this line of inquiry. we investigated the effects of charged nanoparticles (NPs) on the transport properties of lysenin. a pore-forming toxin that shares fundamental features with ion channels such as regulation and high transport rate. The macroscopic conductance of lysenin channels greatly diminished in the presence of cationic ZnO NPs. The inhibitory effects were asymmetrical relative to the direction of the electric field and addition site. suggesting electrostatic interactions between ZnO NPs and a binding site. Similar changes in the macroscopic conductance were observed when lysenin channels were reconstituted in neutral lipid membranes. implicating protein-NP interactions as the major contributor to the reduced transport capabilities. In contrast. no inhibitory effects were observed in the presence of anionic SnO2 NPs. Additionally. we demonstrate that inhibition of ion transport is not due to the dissolution of ZnO NPs and subsequent interactions of zinc ions with lysenin channels. We conclude that electrostatic interactions between positively charged ZnO NPs and negative charges within the lysenin channels are responsible …,True,FGQ1H6AAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,7,https://jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12951-017-0327-9,8588267407113605348,/scholar?cites=8588267407113605348,,https://jnanobiotechnology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12951-017-0327-9,0,0,0

Os predadores escolhidos foram a cegonha-branca (Ciconia ciconia) e a lontra (Lutra lutra) enquanto a presa em comum utilizada foi o lagostim-vermelho-do-luisiana (Procambarus clarkii). sendo este facto confirmado pela análise da dieta. Com este grupo de organismos pretendeu-se comparar a susceptibilidade à contaminação de uma ave e de um mamífero que utilizam as mesmas áreas de alimentação e uma presa comum predominante. Além dessa questão procurou-se avaliar a importância de efeitos temporais e locais na contaminação da espécie-presa e que factores estariam a levar a tais alterações. As amostragens foram realizadas nos meses de Fevereiro. Abril. Maio e Junho de 2009 em 3 áreas distintas ao longo do rio Sado: Murta/Cachopos. Barrosinha e Nogueira.

Indeed. levels of intraspecific variation in natural populations can be very high. even surpassing interspecific variation. In particular. variation in foraging traits can significantly impact ecological processes. The aim of this thesis was to measure the relative strength of drivers of intraspecific variation in foraging traits in the cannibalistic wolf-spider Lycosa fasciiventris and its potential impacts on trophic interactions and consequently trophic cascades.  We evaluated trait variation using a half-sib split brood design. by crossing each male with two females and separating offspring from each family into 2 different rearing environments. The offspring was scored for several morphological. physiological and behavioral traits and heritability. maternal effects and environmental interactions (genotype-by-environment and maternal-by-environment interactions) were determined as well as genetic and maternal correlations. Maternal effects were predominant over additive genetic effects in all traits and their correlations. except in traits related to cannibalism. in which both genetic and maternal effects were absent. In this case. trait variation was explained by the social environment faced by spiders (conspecific cues).  We then evaluated the impacts of intraspecific variation in ecological processes by performing mesocosms experiments. To this aim. we experimentally manipulated intraspecific variation and evaluated its effects upon trophic cascades.

This study characterized the initial loss and determined the effectiveness of two classes of apoptosis inhibitors. protease inhibitors. and antioxidants on the ability of porcine PGCs to survive in culture. Results from electron microscopic analysis and in situ DNA fragmentation assay indicated that porcine PGCs rapidly undergo apoptosis when placed in culture. Additionally. α2-macroglobulin. a protease inhibitor and cytokine carrier. and N-acetylcysteine. an antioxidant. increased the survival of PGCs in vitro. While other protease inhibitors tested did not affect survival of PGCs. all antioxidants tested improved survival of PGCs (P < 0.05). Further results indicated that the beneficial effect of the antioxidants was critical only during the initial period of culture.

Information and Communication Engineers,This paper describes the design of a programmable QAM transceiver for VDSL applications. A 12-b DAC with 64-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at 75-MS/s and an 11-b ADC with 72.3-dB SFDR at 70-MS/s are integrated in this complete physical layer IC. A digital IIR notch filter is included in order to not interrupt existing amateur radio bands. The proposed dual loop AGC adjusts the gain of a variable gain amplifier (VGA) to obtain maximum SNR while avoiding saturation. Using several low power techniques. the total power consumption is reduced to 300-mW at 1.8-V core and 3.3-V I/O supplies. The transceiver is fabricated in a 0.18-µm CMOS process and the chip size is 5-mm <cd0215f.gif> 5-mm.

To test this assumption in existing literature. we undertook a meta-analysis to study the interactive effects of eCO2 and experimentally imposed drought on biomass and yield of crops and pasture grasses. We found that for crop species with C3 metabolism. eCO2 stimulates biomass accumulation and yield under both well-watered and dry conditions to a similar extent.

Fumigation with sub-lethal concentrations of H2S facilitates the supply of reduced sulfur via the leaves while sulfate is depleted from the roots. This restores growth while sulfate levels in the plant tissue remain low. In the present study this system was used to reveal interactions of sulfur with other nutrients in the plant and to ascertain whether these changes are due to the absence or presence of sulfate or rather to changes in growth and organic sulfur. There was a complex reaction of the mineral composition to sulfur deficiency. however. the changes in content of many nutrients were prevented by H2S fumigation. Under sulfur deficiency these nutrients accumulated on a fresh weight basis but were diluted on a dry weight basis. presumably due to a higher dry matter content. The pattern differed. however. between leaves and roots which led to changes in shoot to root partitioning. Only the potassium. molybdenum and zinc contents were strongly linked to the sulfate supply. Potassium was the only nutrient amongst those measured which showed a positive correlation with sulfur content in shoots. highlighting a role as a counter cation for sulfate during xylem loading and vacuolar storage in leaves. This was supported by an accumulation of potassium in roots of the sulfur-deprived plants. Molybdenum and zinc increased substantially under sulfur deficiency. which was only partly prevented by H2S fumigation. While the causes of increased molybdenum under sulfur deficiency have been previously studied. the relation between sulfate and zinc uptake needs …,True,j3t-YBQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,14,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00541/full,2801960407108650915,/scholar?cites=2801960407108650915,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00541/full,0,0,0

Although sodium chloride (NaCl) is one of the most abundant salts in soils. others viz. sulfate salts may also be present in high concentrations in some soil types. Sulfate salts. e.g. Na2SO4. are still widely under-represented amongst salt stress studies and the mechanism of its toxicity is poorly understood. Exposure of Chinese cabbage to Na2SO4 already reduced growth at levels ≥20 mM. accompanied by an increase in the total sulfur content of both roots and shoots. which in the shoot for a greater part could be ascribed to an accumulation of sulfate. Moreover. there was an increase in the total water-soluble non-protein thiol content (glutathione) in roots and shoots.

Onion (Allium cepa L.) plant contains a wide variety of sulfur-containing compounds which may be involved in plant protection against salt stress. In the current study. a similar reduction in growth caused by chloride and sulfate salts was observed when onion was exposed to equimolar concentrations of Na+. Also. no difference was observed for shoot/root ratio and dry matter content of roots and shoots. Plants accumulated Na+ and the respective anions (chloride and sulfate) which in turn caused changes in the content of other nutrients.

Application of 10 mM calcium in the form of CaCl2 in the growth medium of plants only slightly ameliorated growth impairment by NaCl and KCl. but almost completely prevented negative effects of Na2SO4 and K2SO4 on plant biomass production. This effect was calcium specific. as MgCl2 ameliorated sulfate toxicity to a much lower extent. This sulfate toxicity coincided with a strong decrease in the plant content of calcium and manganese upon sulfate salinity.

Improving the nutrient use efficiency (NUE) of crops by breeding will be essential to optimize the use of fertilizers and minimize the environmental footprint of modern agriculture. Nutrients interact in many different ways in plants and these interactions can be of synergistic or antagonistic kind. depending on the chemical properties of the nutrients and on their role in plant metabolism. Consequently. certain crop traits have the potential to increase the use efficiency for several nutrients at the same time. while other traits might lead to an increase for one but a decrease for another nutrient. These trade-offs need attention for an overall improvement of NUE.

Cham,Proton-selective microelectrodes were used to determine sulfate uptake by roots of intact plant seedlings. The response of H+ fluxes to sulfate addition showed to be a good proxy for sulfate uptake by the sulfate/H+ co-transport system. H+ influx and increase in root surface pH was much higher in sulfate-deprived seedlings than in seedlings grown with sufficient sulfate. The opposite was true for the response of H+ fluxes to nitrate addition. By using this method sulfate uptake could be mapped along the root axis. which revealed higher uptake rates in mature regions. Sulfate deprived roots showed a lower root surface pH. which correlated strongly with the response to sulfate addition. A possible contribution of this component to a higher sulfate uptake capacity under sulfur deficiency was further tested by using the fungal toxin fusicoccin. which permanently activates the plasma membrane H+-pumping …,True,j3t-YBQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-56526-2_16,,,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/54420/1/pdf.94#page=172,0,0,0

The potential genotoxic effect induced in mice exposed to ELF-EMFs was investigated. The evaluated cytological endpoint included the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MN) in bone marrow. Three experimental conditions were arranged:(1) acute exposure of 72 h with three intensities of 60 Hz magnetic fields at 1.0. 1.5. and 2.0 mT.(2) expanded exposure of 10 days/8 h daily with three replications. and (3) a combined treatment of 72 h exposure to ELF-EMFs at 60 Hz and 2.0 mT plus 5 mg/kg of Mitomycin-C. For acute exposures. a positive control of MMC as a reference of clastogenic effect was used. Statistically significant differences indicative of ELF-EMF genotoxic effect were observed for MN frequency when compared ELF-EMF exposed and control animals at 1.5 and 2.0 mT exposure conditions. In addition. an antagonistic effect between ELF-EMF exposure and Mitomycin-C treatment in terms of MN frequency was observed for this co-exposure condition.

1062918,Micromorphology of the labellum and structure of the osmophore in a group of closely related species of the sexually deceptive Orchid genus Ophrys (orchidaceae),2016,Ana Margarida Costa Francisco,,,,,,The study of the micromorphology of flowers is crucial to understand the complex process of pollination and the intimate interaction between flowers and pollinators. This plant‐pollinator interaction is a key factor to the diversification and evolution of angiosperms and is particularly tight in species pollinated by sexual deception. almost all of which belonging to the orchid family. The highly specific pollination system of the sexually deceptive species is based on a precise mimicry of the visual. tactile and chemical signals exhibited by the females of the pollinator species (usually a single or a few related insect species). thereby attracting males. which. in most cases. perform copulatory attempts with the flower leading to pollination. In the Euro‐Mediterranean sexually deceptive orchid genus Ophrys. most research has been focused on the chemical mimicry between certain components of the odour bouquet emitted by the flowers and the female sex pheromone of their specific insect pollinators. In most cases. these compounds were shown to be mainly long‐chained hydrocarbons. which are found in the cuticular waxes spread over the surface of the strongly modified median petal typical of orchid flowers – the labellum. However. numerous compounds of higher volatility were shown to act as long‐range attractants for male pollinators. although their site of synthesis and emission (presumably an osmophore) remains unknown. Likewise. little is known about the micromorphological features of the labellum and their importance in providing visual and tactile signals for pollinator attraction.

African honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata) hybridized with the previously introduced and already established European honey bees (EHBs). The resulting Africanized honey bees (AHBs) have spread through the continental tropics of the Western Hemisphere. The expansion of AHB has been constrained in temperate climates generally thought to be because of a lack of key adaptations required for successful overwintering. A drastic increase in longevity during broodless periods is crucial to colony survival. In the temperate context. broodlessness happens in winter. While tropical regions do not experience winters as temperate zones do. seasonal changes in the abundance of floral resources cause variation in brood levels throughout the year. Here we use an island population of AHB in Puerto Rico (gAHB) to test the capacity of tropical-adapted honey bees to alter their longevity in different seasons. as well as under brood manipulation. We found that worker longevity in the gAHB colonies increases in the wet season (maximum longevity ca. 88 days vs 56 days) in response to dearth of floral resources. A more pronounced increase in longevity was observed in response to manipulative reduction of the amount of open brood (maximum longevity 154 days). In addition. long lived gAHB demonstrated the signature winter bee-like hypopharyngeal gland size (average acini diameter 100.8 ± 6.2 µm at 65 and 70 days of age.

These changes can be driven by a parasite to improve its fitness or by the host to improve its ability to combat or tolerate the parasite. Nosema is a microsporidian parasite that chronically infects its honey bee (Apis mellifera) hosts. Nosema infections leads to multiple molecular. physiological and behavioral changes in worker honey bees. including reduced longevity. Overall. infecting young worker bees with Nosema causes them to accelerate their behavioral maturation process. such that they transition from the nursing behavioral state to the foraging behavioral state more rapidly. Here. we examine how worker bees physiological state influences their response to Nosema infection. to determine if this accelerated behavioral transition is associated with improved host resilience to Nosema or a negative impact of the Nosema on the host. We found that Nosema infection significantly impacts the longevity of nurse bees but not forager bees. which maybe a result of the accelerated maturation of Nosema infected bees. since forager bees have reduced longevity.

However. an average of 30% of honey bee colonies is lost every winter in the United States. Honey bee colonies produce ‘winter bees’ in the fall: winter bees exhibit substantially increased longevity and form a thermoregulating cluster to produce and maintain heat. Thus. the production of winter bees during the fall is crucial for the colony survival. However. the factors triggering winter bee production are largely unknown. and beekeepers have no control over the timing and quantity of winter bees produced. We have developed a model describing how environmental and social cues–namely. pheromones–may interact to drive winter bee production. We tested this model by applying two worker produced pheromones. brood pheromone and forager pheromone. to colonies in fall and periodically measure colony demographics (number of brood and workers). colony weight. and overwintering survival. Additionally. we released marked callow workers to the colonies and later recaptured them to examine the effect of pheromones on the expression levels of key genes that are differentially regulated between summer and winter bees. Pheromone treatments had a significant effect on levels of stored pollen and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type-2-like expression.

Each apical meristem of K. candel produced about 6 leaf pairs and 1.3 to 1.9 inflorescences annually. with the number of meristems in each tree increasing to the square of their girth. The size distribution of K. candel was highly skewed at all sites. with an exponential decline in the number of plants as the size increased.

Plants deficient in JA signaling are more susceptible to herbivory as a result of deficiencies in defensive trait expression. Recent studies have implicated the circadian clock in regulating JA-mediated defenses. but the molecular mechanisms linking the clock to JA signaling are unclear. Here. we report that wild tobacco (Nicotiana attenuata) plants rendered deficient in the clock component ZEITLUPE (ZTL) by RNA interference have attenuated resistance to the generalist herbivore Spodoptera littoralis. This effect can be attributed in part to reduced concentrations of nicotine. an abundant JA-regulated toxin produced in N. attenuata roots and transported to shoots.

All key research centers are now under the supervision of an organization called The Molecular Medicine Network. With the growing trend in genetic research. health care officials have recognized the need to draw up a detailed guideline on ethical issues. The Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education recently established a national ethics committee to develop some regulations in the field of bioethics. A 27-clause document was issued by the committee. However. references to genetic studies have been minimal. As such. we are trying to finalize the first draft of a guideline which encompasses the most challenging ethical implications in the field of genetics including informed consent. confidentiality. genetic counseling and potential for social harm or psychologic distress imposed by disclosure of individuals’ genetic information. Shia. a branch of Islam and the official religion of Iran has a number of rules and concepts about some important issues of bioethics which are different to the West. In addition. Gnostic concepts integrated in Persian literature are firmly respected by the Iranian population and these lead to different interpretation of bioethical issues.

Although a proximate mechanism for this phenomenon has remained elusive. a leading hypothesis is that wing wear increases predation risk by reducing flight manoeuvrability. We tested the effects of simulated wing wear on flight manoeuvrability in Bombus impatiens bumblebees using a dynamic obstacle course designed to push bees towards their performance limits. We found that removing 22% wing area from the tips of both forewings (symmetric wear) caused a 9% reduction in peak acceleration during manoeuvring flight. while performing the same manipulation on only one wing (asymmetric wear) did not significantly reduce maximum acceleration. The rate at which bees collided with obstacles was correlated with body length across all treatments. but wing wear did not increase collision rate. possibly because shorter wingspans …,True,8PMhTOQAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,16,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0294,3070426138863316931,/scholar?cites=3070426138863316931,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0294,0,0,0

University of Tasmania,The Australian National Data Service (ANDS) High Values Collection (HVC) program has funded the establishment of an Australian seabed habitat classification scheme and spatial database “Seamap Australia”. Seamap Australia collates all national benthic habitat mapping data into one location on the Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN) complete with metadata records; synthesises these datasets into one spatial data product using a newly proposed national benthic marine classification scheme for the Australian continental shelf; and enables visualisation and download capacity via a web interface (http://www.seamapaustralia.org) to the Seamap Australia synthesis layer. all original collated benthic habitat mapping datasets. and a sample selection of biological data overlays.  The ongoing benefits of the Seamap Australia classification scheme and spatial data product will facilitate national collaborations for benthic research. establish a common seabed mapping vocabulary and encourage a nationally consistent approach for Australian seabed mapping into the future. We anticipate that Seamap Australia will facilitate national scale cross-disciplinary studies of continental shelf habitats. It is our intent that. by collating all the available marine habitat mapping datasets into a single viewing interface (http://www.seamapaustralia.org) and promoting and extending availability of these through the AODN Portal. institutions will work collaboratively to address nationwide solutions.

1063045,Ecophysiology of habitat-forming seaweeds in a changing environment,2015,Emma Flukes,,,,,,‘Ecosystem engineering’ species play a disproportionately important role in ecological systems by modifying (creating or destroying) habitat for other species. Understanding the impact of climate change is particularly critical for habitat-forming ecosystem engineers. as these species are generally facilitative and form the basis of hierarchically organised communities. In temperate marine environments. seaweed beds provide the fundamental structure of most shallow rocky reef communities. The coastline of southeastern Australia is warming at nearly four times the global average rate. with temperature increases occurring simultaneously with reduced nutrient availability due to strengthening seasonal incursions of warm. oligotrophic East Australian Current water. Climate change-driven range contractions in this area have already been documented for the canopy-forming Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa. while the areal coverage of Macrocystis pyrifera forests in Tasmania has declined by ~95% over the last 3-4 decades. Continued climatic change in this region is likely to impact on the physiological performance. reproductive capacity. survival. and ultimately the distribution of important habitat-forming seaweeds. Predicting the future impacts of climate change on species distributions has largely focused around the use of bioclimate envelope models (BEMs). which relate field observations of a species’ geographic distribution with environmental predictor variables to forecast its future distribution. This generalised modelling approach relies on the assumption that the physiological performance of a species under a given set of …,True,wV4o-lcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,2,https://eprints.utas.edu.au/22875/,15463231378281098791,/scholar?cites=15463231378281098791,,https://eprints.utas.edu.au/22875/,0,0,0

We found that whenever these pairs were at the surface they maintained close proximity similar to that observed in terrestrial followers. By examining their dive behaviour. however. we determined that calves dive significantly less frequently and for shorter durations than their mothers. leading to periods of separation during foraging dives. Because this is likely to increase the risk of calf predation. females responded by significantly shortening the duration of their dives when unaccompanied by their offspring. thereby reducing this risk. As the season progressed. we observed that this behaviour waned and females became significantly less responsive to their offspring.

A comparison of Whale mAPP Steller sea lion distribution data to a scientific dataset were comparable (91% overlap) given a high enough sample size (n= 73) and dense spatial coverage. In addition. after using Whale mAPP for two weeks. citizen scientists improved their marine mammal identification skills and self-initiated further learning. representing preliminary steps in developing an engaging citizen science project. While the app experienced high initial enthusiasm. maintaining prolonged commitment represents one of the fundamental challenges for this project.

The accumulated evidence has suggested that aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). a ligand-activated transcription factor. is a promising treatment target for MS. Thus. the current study aimed to identify a novel Ahr ligand with anti-inflammatory potential in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).   Methods An in silico analysis was carried out to predict interactions between Ahr and potential natural ligands. The effects of a predicted interaction were examined in vitro using CD4+ T cells under T helper17 (Th17) cell-polarizing conditions and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Silencing Ahr and microRNA (miR)-132 was achieved by electroporation. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)35-55 and the adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells were used to induce EAE.   Results Molecular docking analysis and in vitro data identified gallic acid (GA) as a novel Ahr ligand with potent activation potential. GA induced the expression of Ahr downstream genes. including cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp1a1) and the miR-212/132 cluster. and promoted the formation of the Ahr/Ahr nuclear translocator (Arnt) complex. In vivo. GA-treated mice were resistant to EAE and exhibited reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased levels of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Furthermore. GA reduced infiltration of CD4+CD45+ T cells and monocytes into the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of GA were concomitant with miR …,True,F9PdrCQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,10,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215981,17634126631373757837,/scholar?cites=17634126631373757837,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0215981,0,0,0

Our physiopathological assumption is that u-PA. t-PA. and PAI-1 are released by calcified aortic valves and play a role in the calcification of these valves. Methods. Sixty-five calcified aortic valves were collected from patients suffering from aortic stenosis. Each valve was incubated for 24 hours in culture medium. The supernatants were used to measure u-PA. t-PA. and PAI-1 concentrations; the valve calcification was evaluated using biphotonic absorptiometry. Results. Aortic stenosis valves expressed normal plasminogen activators concentrations and overexpressed PAI-1 (u-PA. t-PA. and PAI-1 mean concentrations were. resp.. 1.69 ng/mL ± 0.80. 2.76 ng/mL ± 1.33. and 53.27 ng/mL ± 36.39). There was no correlation between u-PA and PAI-1 () but t-PA and PAI-1 were strongly correlated with each other (). Overexpression of PAI-1 was proportional to the calcium content of the AS valves. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate a consistent increase of PAI-1 proportional to the calcification.

Species relying exclusively on non-host food sources. such as plantneetar. frequentlyhave to travel betweenareas containing host and food sources. Therefore. the study of parasitoid movements in the field is crucial for a successful implementation of habitat management measures establishing flowering plant strips at field edges in biological control programs. But despitethe increasing interest in conservation biologicalcontrol information on the infiuence of flowering plant strips at field edges on parasitoid spatial habitatuse and parasitism patterns is often inconsistentor anecdotal. This deficiency must be largelyattributed to the lack of suitable marking techniques for field studies.

This species shows great morphological modifications during ontogenesis. and several studies have verified the existence of a wide intraspecific variation. Because of this condition. the species is often misidentified. and several synonyms have been documented. To elucidate these aspects. individuals of M. olfersii from different populations along its range of distribution were investigated. The taxonomic limit was established. and the degree of genetic variability of this species was described. We extracted DNA from 53 specimens of M. olfersii. M. americanum. M. digueti and M. faustinum. which resulted in 84 new sequences (22 of 16S mtDNA. 45 of Cythocrome Oxidase I (COI) mtDNA. and 17 of Histone (H3) nDNA). Sequences of three genes (single and concatenated) from these species were used in the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference phylogenetic analyses and COI sequences from M. olfersii were used in population analysis. The genetic variation was evaluated through the alignment of 554 bp from the 16S. 638 bp from the COI. and 338 bp from the H3. The rates of genetic divergence among populations were lower at the intraspecific level. This was confirmed by the haplotype net. which showed a continuous gene flow among populations. Although a wide distribution and high morphological intraspecific variation often suggest the existence of more than one species. genetic similarity of Caribbean and Brazilian populations of M. olfersii supported them as a single species.,True,fWAVxEIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,54,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054698,7946441600047938490,/scholar?cites=7946441600047938490,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054698,0,0,0

Winter temperatures in northern latitudes are predicted to increase markedly as a result of ongoing climate change. thus making the invasion of new insect defoliators possible. The establishment of new outbreak pest species may have major effects on northern ecosystems that are particularly sensitive to disturbances.2. Effects of winter minimum temperatures under field and laboratory conditions were examined and limitations by minimum temperatures on future range expansion were investigated for invasive [Operophtera brumata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)] and potentially invasive [Agriopis aurantiaria (Lepidoptera: Geometridae)] birch‐feeding forest pests.

In northern Europe. winter and autumnal moths undergo regular 9–11 year population cycles. The winter moth cycle has typically been phase-locked with that of the autumnal moth. but with a 1–3-year phase lag. We examined potential effects of natural enemies on this phase lag using field experiments and observational data. We found that larval parasitism was significantly higher in autumnal than in winter moths. Conversely. pupal predation by generalist invertebrates was clearly greater in winter than in autumnal moths. The difference in parasitism rates may contribute to the earlier collapse of the autumnal moth cycle. In addition. the phase lag may be strengthened by higher pupal mortality in winter moths in the early increase phase of the cycles.

The adaptation potential of the invaders affects largely on how well the invasive species can spread to new areas and in what extent can they have an impact on the invaded ecosystem. To measure the adaptation potential of an invasive (winter moth) and a potentially invasive defoliating moth species (scarce umber moth). we examined life history parameters in two environments on a set of genetically diverse host trees and compared the traits with those of a resident moth species (autumnal moth). In addition. variations in life history parameters due to host genotype were calculated and compared.The bioassay was executed by rearing moth larvae on 11 half‐sib families of the host tree in two large tree line gardens.

However. a positive outcome for the host plant is a necessary precondition for making the attraction beneficial or even adaptive. Parasitoids benefit plants by killing herbivorous insects. thus reducing future herbivore pressure. but also by curtailing the feeding intensity of the still living. parasitised host. In this study. the effect of parasitism on food consumption of the 5th instar larvae of the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata) was examined under laboratory conditions. Daily food consumption. as well as the duration of the 5th instar. was measured for both parasitised and non-parasitised larvae.

The effects of these disturbances can be seen from landscape-level dieback of the birch forest to local-level changes in soil processes. Recent research efforts have demonstrated that the geometrid moth–birch forest system is undergoing changes that could be linked to the ongoing climate warming. Milder winter and spring temperatures influence winter survival and outbreak ranges of the moths. and are also alleviating range expansions and the spread of new species to the area. Moreover. phenology matching with the host plant may be altered. The outcome appears to be intensified outbreaks and a potential for altered species interactions and dynamics with ecosystemwide consequences.This chapter will first introduce the prevailing dynamics of the mountain birch–geometrid system and the reported ecosystem effects of geometrid outbreaks.

Despite the well-known sensitivity of insects to abiotic effects such as temperature. their potential responses to ongoing climate change remain unclear. Here we compile and review documented climate change responses of 31 of the globally most impactful phytophagous insect pests. focussing on species for which long-term. high-quality data are available. Most of the selected species show at least one response affecting their severity as pests. including changes in geographic range. population dynamics. life-history traits. and/or trophic interactions. Of the studied pests. 41% only show responses that are linked to increased pest severity. 4% only show responses of decreased severity. whereas importantly 55%. the majority of studied pests. show mixed responses including both increased and decreased severity under ongoing climate change. Variability in impact is further supported by a thermal sensitivity analysis showing little benefit of climate warming in relation to the optimal developmental temperatures for the majority of these pests under both current climate and future projections. Overall the results show that calculating the net effect of climate change on phytophagous insect pest impact is far from straightforward.

This is one of the most basic questions in ecology. and one which still puzzles the minds of ecologists. In general. communities have been shaped into their present form by the abiotic environment and by historical and present interactions between organisms. Where abiotic conditions do not limit species existence. interactions with both lower and higher trophic levels have been proposed as the mechanisms that can define the assemblage of existing species (eg MacArthur 1958. Hairston et al. 1960. Connell 1961. Price et al. 1980). For insect herbivores. the prevailing hypotheses have fluctuated from the view of Hairston et al.(1960) of higher trophic levels controlling species abundance at lower levels (top-down) to Murdoch’s (1966) argument of the greater control of lower trophic levels over the higher ones (bottom-up). More recent conclusions have combined these two views (eg Price et al. 1980. Denno et al. 2005.

Here. we report a possible case of sympatric speciation in ricefishes of the genus Oryzias on Sulawesi. an island of Wallacea. Three species of Oryzias are known to be endemic to Lake Poso. an ancient tectonic lake in central Sulawesi. Phylogenetic analyses using RAD‐seq‐derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that these species are monophyletic. We also found that the three species are morphologically distinguishable and clearly separated by population‐structure analyses based on the SNPs. suggesting that they are reproductively isolated from each other. A mitochondrial DNA chronogram suggested that their speciation events occurred after formation of the tectonic lake. and existence of a historical allopatric phase …,True,xsVKcCIAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,4,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/evo.13821,13567661656194828065,/scholar?cites=13567661656194828065,,https://researchmap.jp/JMontzalez/published_papers/1209189/attachment_file.pdf,0,0,0

After reconstructing the phylogeny separately for Nomorhamphus and Oryzias using transcriptome‐wide sequences. we demonstrated positive correlations of body redness between these two taxa across environments. even after phylogenetic corrections. which support convergent evolution.

It has been demonstrated that continuous measurements of E h are valuable for tracking bacterial metabolic activities of bacterial species in liquid cultures. However. it remains uncertain whether this phenomenon is widespread among bacterial species and whether E h measurements reflect similar mechanisms in more complex systems such as soils and sediments. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate whether bacteria that naturally occur in sediments have the capacity to control E h and assess the relative partitioning of biological processes involved in E h in natural sediments.

Unexpectedly. the largest Wolbachia genome was found in the obligate. parthenogenesis-associated wFol. In this study. we investigate possible processes underlying this genome expansion by comparing a re-annotated wFol genome to other Wolbachia genomes. In addition. we also search for candidate genes related to parthenogenesis induction (PI). Within wFol. we found five phage WO regions representing 25.4% of the complete genome. few pseudogenized genes. and an expansion of DNA-repair genes in comparison to other Wolbachia. These signs of genome conservation were mirrored in the wFol host. the springtail F. candida. which also had an expanded DNA-repair gene family and many horizontally transferred genes. Across all Wolbachia genomes. there was a strong correlation between gene numbers of Wolbachia strains and their hosts. In order to identify genes with a potential link to PI. we assembled the genome of an additional PI strain. wLcla. Comparisons between four PI Wolbachia. including wFol and wLcla. and fourteen non-PI Wolbachia yielded a small set of potential candidate genes for further investigation. The strong similarities in genome content of wFol and its host. as well as the correlation between host and Wolbachia gene numbers suggest that there may be some form of convergent evolution between endosymbiont and host genomes.

As global atmospheric concentrations of CO 2.

We assessed responses of soil fluxes of CO 2 (soil respiration). CH 4. and N 2 O to elevated temperature and altered precipitation treatments along the C. Hart Merriam Elevation Gradient Transect in Northern Arizona during a monsoon season. We found significant increases in soil respiration and N 2 O efflux. and a decrease in CH 4 oxidation (uptake) in response to increasing elevation and precipitation. We found that warming of~ 3 C in the mixed conifer ecosystem removed temperature limitations on production of N 2 O and CO 2. and that CH 4 oxidation was not temperature dependent. We also found that altering precipitation within ecosystems influenced fluxes of all three gasses. As soil moisture increased. soil respiration and N 2 O efflux increased. while CH 4 oxidation appeared to become limited by diffusion of CH 4 and/or oxygen. Overall. we found that the increase in temperature and precipitation predicted for Northern Arizona during the monsoon season will result in an increase in soil respiration and N 2 O production and a decrease in CH 4 oxidation by soils.

Natural abundance measurements of soil N pools have the potential to provide information regarding N-transformations. Recently we have developed a protocol to measure the 15 N natural abundance of the soil microbial biomass using the chloroform fumigation-extraction procedure. We measured the 15 N isotope signatures of the microbial biomass. extractable and total N pools in soils from an elevation gradient. a semi-arid and tropical soil age gradient. and a dung gradient. Results show that 1) the δ 15 N of the microbial biomass differs from that of the soil extractable and total N. and 2) the difference between the natural abundance 15 N composition of the microbial biomass relative to that of the extractable N pool varies with C and N availability in the soil. We postulate that the 15 N-enrichment of the microbial biomass relative to other soil pools is associated with fractionation during N assimilation and dissimilation processes. This interpretation suggests that a high 15 N enrichment of the microbial biomass is associated with low C availability. high dissimilation and thus high N-mineralization rates.,True,oagzKn8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://scisoc.confex.com/scisoc/2006am/techprogram/P24393.HTM,,,,,0,0,0

By incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations. we generated a hyper–interferon-sensitive (HIS) virus as a vaccine candidate.

There are two commonly employed sequencing library preparation strategies to improve sequencing accuracy by correcting sequencing errors: read-pairing method and tag-clustering method (i.e. primer ID or UID). Here. we constructed a homogeneous library from a single clone. and compared the variant calling accuracy of these error-correction methods. We comprehensively described the strengths and pitfalls of these methods. We found that both read-pairing and tag-clustering methods significantly decreased sequencing error rate.

However. there is a lack of experimental approach to systematically probe for epistatic residues. By utilizing the information from natural occurring sequences and high-throughput genetics. this study established a novel strategy to identify epistatic residues. The rationale is that a substitution that is deleterious in one strain may be prevalent in nature due to the presence of a naturally occurring compensatory substitution. Here. high-throughput genetics was applied to influenza A virus M segment to systematically identify deleterious substitutions. Comparison with natural sequence variation showed that a deleterious substitution M1 Q214H was prevalent in circulating strains. A coevolution analysis was then performed and indicated that M1 residues 121. 207. 209. and 214 naturally coevolved as a group. Subsequently. we experimentally validated that M1 A209T was a compensatory substitution for M1 Q214H. This work provided a proof-of-concept to identify epistatic residues by coupling high-throughput genetics with phylogenetic information. In particular. we were able to identify an epistatic interaction between M1 substitutions A209T and Q214H.

Here we provide controlled assessments of fitness landscapes and CTL-imposed constraints for immunodominant epitopes presented by two protective (B*57 and B*27) and one non-protective (A*02) MHC-I types. Libraries of HIV-1 with saturation mutagenesis of CTL epitopes are propagated with and without CTL selective pressure to define the fitness landscapes for epitope mutation and escape from CTLs via deep sequencing. Immunodominant B*57- and B*27- present epitopes are highly limited in options for fit mutations. with most viable variants recognizable by CTLs. whereas an immunodominant A*02 epitope-presented is highly permissive for mutation. with many options for CTL evasion without loss of viability. Generally. options for evasion overlap considerably between CTL clones despite highly distinct T cell receptors. Finally. patterns of variant recognition suggest population-wide CTL selection for the A*02-presented epitope.

However. the role of fitness cost in the evolution of drug resistance has often been overlooked in clinical studies or in vitro selection experiments. as these observations only capture the outcome of drug selection. In this study. we systematically profile the fitness landscape of resistance-associated sites in HIV-1 protease using deep mutational scanning. We construct a mutant library covering combinations of mutations at 11 sites in HIV-1 protease. all of which are associated with resistance to protease inhibitors in clinic. Using deep sequencing. we quantify the fitness of thousands of HIV-1 protease mutants after multiple cycles of replication in human T cells. Although the majority of resistance-associated mutations have deleterious effects on viral replication. we find that epistasis among resistance-associated mutations is predominantly positive. Furthermore. our fitness data are consistent with genetic interactions inferred directly from HIV sequence data of patients. Fitness valleys formed by strong positive epistasis reduce the likelihood of reversal of drug resistance mutations.

Phylogenetic analyses were performed for nrDNA (ITS) and cpDNA (trnK region and rps16 intron) datasets. using Bayesian and Parsimony analyses. Our results cast doubt on the inclusion of Pterygiella and related genera within the Rhinantheae and support the para‐ phyly of Phtheirospermum. making it necessary to propose three new combinations to avoid it.

On the utility of de novo and reference-based assembly of Nanopore data for plant plastome sequencing,2020,Agnes Scheunert and Marco Dorfner and Thomas Lingl and Christoph Oberprieler,15,PloS one,3,e0226234,Public Library of Science,The chloroplast genome harbors plenty of valuable information for phylogenetic research. Illumina short-read data is generally used for de novo assembly of whole plastomes. PacBio or Oxford Nanopore long reads are additionally employed in hybrid approaches to enable assembly across the highly similar inverted repeats of a chloroplast genome. Unlike for PacBio. plastome assemblies based solely on Nanopore reads are rarely found. due to their high error rate and non-random error profile. However. the actual quality decline connected to their use has rarely been quantified. Furthermore. no study has employed reference-based assembly using Nanopore reads. which is common with Illumina data. Using Leucanthemum Mill. as an example. we compared the sequence quality of seven chloroplast genome assemblies of the same species. using combinations of two sequencing platforms and three analysis pipelines. In addition. we assessed the factors which might influence Nanopore assembly quality during sequence generation and bioinformatic processing. The consensus sequence derived from de novo assembly of Nanopore data had a sequence identity of 99.59% compared to Illumina short-read de novo assembly. Most of the errors detected were indels (81.5%). and a large majority of them is part of homopolymer regions. The quality of reference-based assembly is heavily dependent upon the choice of a close-enough reference. When using a reference with 0.83% sequence divergence from the studied species. mapping of Nanopore reads results in a consensus comparable to that from Nanopore de novo assembly. and of only …,True,fPc3rNcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,6,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226234,9615932698523547978,/scholar?cites=9615932698523547978,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0226234,0,0,0

Scrophulariaceae Juss.(dealing with the type genus Scrophularia L.) and Orobanchaceae Vent.(tribe Rhinantheae Lam. & DC.). Rhinantheae are hemiparasitic plants with a predominantly Northern Hemisphere distribution. alongside some representatives which have radiated on southern continents. eg the genus Bartsia L. sensu Molau (1990) with several Andean and two afromontane species. The figwort genus Scrophularia is widespread across the temperate Northern Hemisphere. It comprises about 250 species of mainly herbaceous or suffrutescent perennials. and is characterized by considerable morphological variability and chromosomal diversity. Reticulate evolution is common in Scrophularia as well as several genera within Rhinantheae. The aim of this thesis was 1) to test previous phylogenetic hypotheses of Rhinantheae. also by including several small genera; 2) to investigate phylogenetic relationships within Bartsia sensu Molau (1990) and Odontites Ludw.. and to re-evaluate existing taxonomic concepts; 3) to verify the monophyly of Scrophularia and. for the first time. establish a comprehensive phylogenetic framework including all relevant lineages; 4) to reconstruct the biogeographic history of the genus. to gain insight into colonization pathways and the processes which have formed present distribution patterns; 5) to determine possible causes for the high species diversity and endemicity in several areas of the distribution range; 6) to assess …,True,fPc3rNcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/20847/,,,,https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/20847/1/Scheunert_Agnes.pdf,0,0,0

RNA editing and alternative splicing are two major RNA processing steps that can introduce significant modifications to the final gene products. By tackling these processes in isolation. recent studies have enabled substantial progress in understanding their global RNA targets and regulatory pathways.

The present study further investigates this issue and explores whether d-cycloserine (DCS). a partial agonist at the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptors that has been regarded as a cognitive enhancer. would reverse scopolamine (SCOP)-induced amnesia in two olfactory learning tasks when administered into the prelimbic cortex (PLC). Thus. in experiment 1. DCS (10 µg/site) was infused prior to acquisition of odor discrimination (ODT) and social transmission of food preference (STFP). which have been previously characterized as paradigms sensitive to PLC muscarinic blockade. Immediately after learning such tasks. SCOP was injected (20 µg/site) and the effects of both drugs (alone and combined) were tested in 24-h retention tests. To assess whether DCS effects may depend on the difficulty of the task. in the STFP the rats expressed their food preference either in a standard two-choice test (experiment 1) or a more challenging three-choice test (experiment 2). The results showed that bilateral intra-PLC infusions of SCOP markedly disrupted the ODT and STFP memory tests. Additionally. infusions of DCS alone into the PLC enhanced ODT but not STFP retention. However. the DCS treatment reversed SCOP-induced memory deficits in both tasks. and this effect seemed more apparent in ODT and 3-choice STFP. Such results support the interaction between the glutamatergic and the cholinergic systems in the PLC in such a way that positive modulation of the NMDA receptor …,True,gGw210AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,11,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070584,11210056616044004535,/scholar?cites=11210056616044004535,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0070584,0,0,0

It is related to neurodevelopment and associated to severe symptoms of schizophrenia and alterations in brain structure. as well as positive schizotypal personality traits in non-clinical samples. Moreover. a female-specific association has been observed between ZNF804A and schizophrenia.   Aim The present study examined the association of two ZNF804A polymorphisms (rs1344706 and rs7597593) with the positive dimension of schizotypy and psychotic-like experiences in a sample of 808 non-clinical subjects. Additionally. we wanted to explore whether the sexual differences reported in schizophrenia are also present in psychosis-proneness.   Results Our results showed an association between rs7597593 and both schizotypy and psychotic-like experiences. These associations were driven by females. such those carrying the C allele had higher scores in the positive dimension of both variables compared to TT allele homozygotes.

However. previous GxE studies with FKBP5 have not measured the full environmental spectrum or applied statistical tests to discern whether the GxE interaction fits better with the differential-susceptibility or diathesis-stress hypotheses. This study examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on FKBP5 gene moderate the association of positive and negative recent life events (LEs) with depressive symptoms. state-anxiety. neuroticism. and social anxiety traits.   Methods A total of 86 nonclinical young adults were administered psychological measures and were genotyped for five FKBP5 SNPs (rs3800373. rs9296158. rs1360780. rs9470080 and rs4713916).   Results Regression analyses indicated significant GxE interactions for social anxiety and neuroticism. The interactions predicting neuroticism fit different models for different SNPs. although the overall effect indicated by the haplotype was consistent with the differential-susceptibility hypothesis: the risk-haplotype group presented higher neuroticism in the presence of more negative LEs and lower neuroticism in the presence of more positive LEs. The GxE interactions for social anxiety were consistent with the diathesis-stress model. The lack of significance in the for-better side for social anxiety might be related to the fact that it mapped onto low extraversion. which is associated with a lower permeability to positive experiences.

The main risk is to become a more artificial continent–to lose the nature and all that human being could gain from it. The ecological network Natura 2000 is the solution through which the Europe strives to preserve the nature in all its actual diversity and to promote economic activities without prejudice the biodiversity. We could say that NATURA 2000 tries to conciliate two needs of humans. both vital: the need to gain incomes and the need to preserve the nature alive. which is not an untouchable objective but it requires much equilibrium and wisdom. The present paper proposes to approach both the problems faced at the implementation of the Ecological European Network “Natura 2000” in the area of grasslands and hayfields and to offer solutions of good practices regarding the rational exploitation of the grasslands and hayfields both in protected and unprotected areas. Among the main causes which contribute to degradation of the grasslands and hayfields there are: overgrazing. non-grazing. land clearing and arson of Pinus mugo woods. the conversion of the grasslands into arable lands. changing of land usage. the absence of a coherent management and other causes. Also. a special threat is constituted by the precarious state of the local agricultural economy. The traditional agricultural non-profitable methods. the massive emigration of population out of the rural medium led to abandonment of the marginal lands and to intensification of exploitation of the lands easy of access.

The present study was designed to elucidate apoptosis induction by crocin. a main component of Crocus sativus in a human pancreatic cancer cell line (BxPC-3). Methods: Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Hoechest33258 staining was used to detect the chromatin condensation characteristic of apoptosis. and DNA fragmentation was assessed by gel electrophoresis and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. Results: Crocin induced apoptosis and G1-phase cell cycle arrest of BxPC-3 cells. while decreasing cell viability in a dose dependent and time dependent manner. Cells treated with 10µg/L crocin exhibited apoptotic morphology (brightly blue-fluorescent condensed nuclei on Hoechst 33258 staining) and reduction of volume.

In many polygynous species. males are larger than females and may require additional allocation of maternal resources. Differential allocation to sons and daughters requires either spontaneously increased supply of maternal resources in the more expensive sex or that sex to induce additional supply by its greater demand. In the Galapagos sea lion. Zalophus wollebaeki. males are larger than females from birth to weaning. However. offspring begin to forage by diving before weaning. Therefore. we investigated whether sons demand more supply of maternal resources than daughters or contribute more by independent foraging.

Cham,Galapagos sea lions are the smallest sea lion species worldwide. The population consists of about 20.000 individuals. is endemic to the Galapagos Islands and has been separated for about 2.5 million years from the California sea lion. The equatorial environment differs from that of other pinnipeds by terrestrial heat and reduced marine productivity. Growth and development is strongly influenced by marine variability. particularly El Niño events. which also decrease juvenile and adult survival. Large males establish aquatic territories. but smaller non-territorial males also achieve reproductive success. Time at the colony proves the best predictor of reproductive success. which reflects the long drawn-out reproductive season often lasting 6 months. Females mature relatively late at about 5 years and reproduce often only every other year.

Accordingly. one may expect spatial preferences to differ with regard to individual characteristics and to change over time. We investigated lifetime changes of site fidelity patterns with regard to reproductive success in male Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki).

SST. a correlate of marine productivity) at three developmental stages. the perinatal phase (1st month). the main lactation period (1st year). and the weaning period (2nd year). Supporting the FM hypothesis. we found that. early in life (1st month). at equal birth mass. males survived less well than females.

However. simple counts of animals can be misleading and this problem is exacerbated in seals (pinnipeds) where individuals spend much time foraging away from colonies. We analyzed a 13-year-series of census data of Galapagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki) from the colony of Caamaño. an islet in the center of the Galapagos archipelago where a large proportion of animals was individually marked. Based on regular resighting efforts during the cold. reproductive (cold-R; August to January) and the warm. non-reproductive (warm-nR; February to May) season. we document changes in numbers for different sex and age classes. During the cold-R season the number of adults increased as the number of newborn pups increased. Numbers were larger in the morning and evening than around mid-day and not significantly influenced by tide levels. More adults frequented the colony during the warm-nR season than the cold-R season. Raw counts suggested a decline in numbers over the 13 years. but Lincoln-Petersen (LP-) estimates (assuming a closed population) did not support that conclusion. Raw counts and LP estimates were not significantly correlated. demonstrating the overwhelming importance of variability in attendance patterns of individuals. The probability of observing a given adult in the colony varied between 16% (mean for cold-R season) and 23% (warm-nR season) and may be much less for independent 2 to 4 year olds.

In colonial species. large body size and prior residency correlate with the ability to establish dominance and ultimately to achieve matings. However. in addition to dominance. attendance in proximity to females may also enhance male mating success. If females come into oestrus highly asynchronously. males are unable to attend females for the entire breeding season. We expect the attendance of the most competitive males to increase with the availability of receptive females while less competitive males may primarily attend colonies when more competitive males are rare.

During this activation. vitamin K is converted into vitamin K epoxide. which must be re-reduced by the VKORC1 enzyme. Various VKORC1 mutations have been described in humans. While these mutations have been widely associated with anticoagulant resistance. their association with a modification of vitamin K status due to a modification of the enzyme efficiency has never been considered. Using animal models with different Vkorc1 mutations receiving a standard diet or a menadione-deficient diet. we investigated this association by measuring different markers of the vitamin K status. Each mutation dramatically affected vitamin K recycling efficiency. This decrease in recycling was associated with a significant alteration of the vitamin K status. even when animals were fed a menadione-enriched diet suggesting a loss of vitamin K from the cycle due to the presence of the Vkorc1 mutation. This change in vitamin K status resulted in clinical modifications in mutated rats only when animals receive a limited vitamin K intake totally consistent with the capacity of each strain to recycle vitamin K.

Control over the silver nanoparticle coverage at the nanobead surface is achieved by changing the reaction parameters. Moreover. the silver‐decorated magnetic nanobeads (Ag‐MNBs) are studied with respect to their in vitro cytotoxicity on two distinct tumour cell lineages under different parameters. i.e.. dose. incubation time. magnetic field applied during the culturing. silver ion leakage. and colloidal stability. It is found that enhanced magnetically mediated cellular uptake and silver ion leakage from the Ag‐MNBs surface are the main factors which affect the toxicity of the Ag‐MNBs and allow the half‐maximal inhibitory dose of silver to be reduced to only 32 μg mL−1.

Therefore. the return of submerged macrophytes is the target of many lake restoration projects. However. at present. north-western European aquatic ecosystems are increasingly invaded by omnivorous exotic crayfish. We hypothesize that invasive crayfish pose a novel constraint on the regeneration of submerged macrophytes in restored lakes and may jeopardize restoration efforts. We experimentally investigated whether the invasive crayfish (Procambarus clarkii Girard) affects submerged macrophyte development in a Dutch peat lake where these crayfish are expanding rapidly. Seemingly favourable abiotic conditions for macrophyte growth existed in two 0.5 ha lake enclosures. which provided shelter and reduced turbidity. and in one lake enclosure iron was added to reduce internal nutrient loading. but macrophytes did not emerge. We transplanted three submerged macrophyte species in a full factorial exclosure experiment. where we separated the effect of crayfish from large vertebrates using different mesh sizes combined with a caging treatment stocked with crayfish only. The three transplanted macrophytes grew rapidly when protected from grazing in both lake enclosures. demonstrating that abiotic conditions for growth were suitable. Crayfish strongly reduced biomass and survival of all three macrophyte species while waterfowl and fish had no additive effects.

While providing access to nutritious foods. these behaviours may incur significant costs. such as the time and energy spent searching for. manufacturing and transporting tools. These costs can be reduced by re-using tools. keeping them safe when not needed.

1063290,Sociality enhances survival in science. especially for female researchers,2020,Jessica EM van der Wal and Rose Thorogood and Nicholas PC Horrocks,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Intense competition for limited opportunities means the career path of a scientist is a challenging one. and female scientists in particular are less likely to survive in academia. Collaboration is a key factor in scientific advances. and in social species enhanced sociality improves fitness and longevity. Yet whether sociality influences career progression and survival in science. and how this might differ between genders. is largely unknown. We built authorship social networks from publication records to test how sociality predicts career progression and survival in a cohort of biologists contributing to three international conferences in the 1990s. We show that sociality has the strongest effect for female researchers but. regardless of gender. publishing with many diverse co-authors significantly reduces time to become a principal investigator and increases career duration. Publishing repeatedly with co-authors also enhances career progression in both genders. but reduces career length for men. These findings demonstrate that the value of collaboration extends beyond scientific advances. and can directly benefit the career progression and longevity of research scientists themselves. Efforts to encourage researchers at all levels to invest in collaborations. particularly with female researchers. will help to close the gender gap in science and academia.,True,Jtf856gAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.973479v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/04/2020.03.02.973479.full.pdf,0,0,0

Studies in tropical coastal wetlands at a catchment scale are scarce. and most work has been undertaken on small. temperate wetlands. In this study. we tested whether natural coastal wetlands in a tropical catchment (Tully-Murray. Queensland. Australia) could ameliorate nitrogen (N) exported to the Great Barrier Reef during a flood event. We measured denitrification rates in different types of coastal wetlands (mangroves. saltmarshes. waterbodies with macrophytes. and floodplain wetlands dominated by Melaleuca spp.) to assess their potential contribution to N losses during the 6-day duration of a flood in March 2018. Denitrification potential was variable across the landscape. and we identified “hotspots” in sub-catchments with high NO3--N concentrations (0.4 - 0.6 mg L-1) and large areas of wetlands (> 800 ha. > 40% of the sub-catchment). These hotspots can denitrify up to 10 t of NO3--N per day during a flood. We used our measured denitrification rates to provide input parameters for a model that includes the main biogeochemical processes affecting N transformations within wetlands (nitrification. denitrification. plant uptake. sedimentation. anammox. and mineralisation). and accounts for transport via the duration. depth. and flow of water. Model simulations of a sub-catchment of the Tully-Murray indicate that flood inundation of large areas of natural wetlands (> 40% of the sub-catchment area) could potentially remove 70% of the incoming NO3--N load in the first 24 h of the flood.

Here. we examine the variances in synchronous display of female and male function. ratio of male to female flowers per day and subsequently reproductive output in small populations of two monoecious plants. Sagittaria trifolia and Sagittaria graminea.   Methodology/Principal Finding We created plant populations of size 2. 4. 10 and 20 and recorded the daily number of blooming male and female flowers per plant to determine daily floral display. flowering synchrony index and ratio of male to female flowers per day. We also harvested the fruits. counted the seeds and calculated the number of fruits and seeds per flower to measure reproductive success through female function. There is less overlap in flowering time of female and male function in smaller populations than in larger populations. Most importantly. we found that male-biased floral sex ratio and imbalanced display period of female and male function for individual plant can lead to a population-size-dependent ratio of male to female flowers per day. Increasing ratio of male to female flowers per day was generally associated with a greater percentage of fruit production.   Conclusions/Significance Our results highlight the importance of flowering synchrony of female and male function and population-size-dependent ratio of male to female flowers per day for female reproductive success.

1063310,Phylogenetics and biogeography of Australian subterranean Parabathynellidae.,2012,Kym Abrams,,,,,,The putatively ancient subterranean crustacean family Parabathynellidae has been poorly studied. in part because of the problem of obtaining material from difficult to access subterranean habitats in which they live. Further. the systematics of the group has been complicated by their generally simplified morphology and isolated descriptions of new taxa in the absence of any phylogenetic framework. This thesis provides a comprehensive molecular systematics framework for Australian Parabathynellidae. which is used to explore phylogenetic relationships amongst parabathynellids. their diversity. some aspects of character evolution and their biogeographic history within Australia. In addition. taxonomic descriptions are provided for the first parabathynellid species from South Australia. For the first data chapter molecular sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and 18S rRNA genes were generated in order to examine phylogenetic relationships amongst Australian genera and assess the species diversity of this group within Australia. The resultant phylogenetic framework. in combination with an ancestral state reconstruction analysis. was used to explore the evolution of two key morphological characters previously used to define genera. and assess the oligomerization principle (i.e. serial appendage reduction over time). which is commonly invoked in crustacean systematics. The ancestral state reconstruction analysis was also used to determine whether there has been convergent evolution of appendage numbers during the evolution of Australian parabathynellids.

Its biological control is mainly through the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). Colonization. mass-rearing conditions and the irradiation process impact the competitiveness of sterile males and disrupt symbiotic associations by favoring some bacterial species and suppressing others. Levels of Providencia species have been shown to fluctuate considerably in the gut of the medfly laboratory strain Vienna 8 under irradiation. increasing by up to 22%. This study aimed to determine the pathogenicity of Providencia rettgeri isolated from the gut of laboratory Vienna 8 medfly strains by examining the effects of 1) two different treatment doses on egg-hatching and development and 2) two infection methodologies (ingestion and injection) of male and female adults according to their mating status. Treatment of eggs with P. rettgeri (2%) significantly decreased the mean egg to pupae recovery rate.

Malathion upon repeated and prolonged use may cause resistance. In an attempt to reduce the insecticide residues in fruit. the government is trying to introduce the application of spinosad that was also reported to cause resistance under extensive use. The aim of this work was to monitor the susceptibility to malathion after prolonged use in wild caught tunisian Ceratitis as well as to spinosad after a survey carried out with farmers and to give precise informations about treatment management state. Surveys and sampling of the wild strain of Ceratitis capitata were conducted in several regions to learn about the nature and number of treatments. The samples were subjected to ingestion toxicity bioassays of malathion and spinosad at different concentrations. Histopathological effects of spinosad were also studied and showed that for doses up to LC50. annoying effects begin to appear in glial and neurosecretory cells. The LC50 for malathion was 75.61 ppm for the populations treated more than 6 times. Low levels of resistance are suspected and should be confirmed by molecular analyses for malathion. On the other hand. spinosad LC50 were 127.95 ppm and 22 ppm for field and laboratory population. respectively.

Several clinical trials have shown moderate efficiency in improving patient survival. and the search for pharmacological agents to enhance the immune response and reduce melanoma metastases is still necessary. Statins block the mevalonate pathway. which leads to decreases in GTPase isoprenylation and activity. particularly those of the Ras superfamily. They are widely used as hypocholesterolemic agents in cardiovascular diseases and several studies have shown that they also have protective effects against cancers. Furthermore. we have previously demonstrated that treatment of melanoma cells with inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway. such as statins. favor the development of specific adaptive immune responses against these tumors. In the present study. we tested statin impact on the innate immune response against human metastatic melanoma cells. Our data shows that treatment of two human melanoma cell lines with statins induced a weak but significant increase of MICA membrane expression. PPARγ is involved in this statin-induced MICA overexpression. which is independent of Ras and Rho GTPase signaling pathways. Interestingly. this MICA overexpression makes melanoma cells more sensitive to in vitro lysis by NK cells. The impact of statin-treatment on in vivo development of melanoma tumors and metastases was investigated in nude mice. because murine NK cells. which express NKG2D receptors. are able to recognize and kill human tumor cells expressing MICA.

Our team has previously shown that RhoA GTPase and its effector ROCK kinases negatively control FasL membrane expression in murine melanoma B16F10 cells. In this study we found that B16F10 treatment with the ROCK inhibitor H1152 reduced melanoma development in vivo through FasL membrane over-expression. Although H1152 treatment did not reduce tumor growth rate in vitro. the inhibitor delayed tumor appearance and slowed tumor growth in C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice in vivo. Thanks to the use of mice bearing mutated Fas receptors (B6/lpr). we found that reduced tumor growth. observed in immunocompetent mice. was linked to FasL over-expression induced by H1152 treatment. Tumor growth analysis in immunosuppressed NUDE and IFNγ-KO mice highlighted a major role for T lymphocytes and IFNγ in the H1152-induced tumor growth reduction. Histological analyses of subcutaneous tumors. obtained from untreated versus H1152-treated B16F10 cells. showed that H1152 pretreatment induced a strong intra-tumoral infiltration of lymphocytes. Cytofluorometric analysis showed that these were mainly activated CD8 lymphocytes. which were responsible for the reduction in tumor growth.

We have previously shown that geranylgeranyl transferase inhibition (done with GGTI-298) stimulates anti-melanoma immune response through MHC-I and costimulatory molecule expression in the B16F10 murine model [1].  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. it is shown that vaccination with mIFN-gand GGTI-298 pretreated B16F10 cells induces a protection against untreated tumor growth and pulmonary metastases implantation. Furthermore. using a human melanoma model (LB1319-MEL). we demonstrated that in vitro treatment with hIFN-γ and GGTI-298 led to the up regulation of MHC-I and a costimulatory molecule CD86 and down regulation of an inhibitory molecule PD-1L. Co-culture experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) revealed that modifications induced by hIFN-γ and GGTI-298 on the selected melanoma cells. enables the stimulation of lymphocytes from HLA compatible healthy donors. Indeed. as compared with untreated melanoma cells. pretreatment with hIFN-γ and GGTI-298 together rendered the melanoma cells more efficient at inducing the: i) activation of CD8 T lymphocytes (CD8+/CD69+); ii) proliferation of tumor-specific CD8 T cells (MelanA-MART1/TCR+); iii) secretion of hIFN-γ; and iv) anti-melanoma specific cytotoxic cells.

Its ectopic expression has been described in several types of cancer cells including lymphomas. renal cell carcinomas and glioblastomas. We have recently described its expression in a part of tumor cells from the vast majority of melanoma biopsies and human melanoma cell lines. and found that CD70 expression decreased over time as the disease progressed. Here. we show that RhoA. BRAF and Mitogen Activating Protein Kinase pathways are involved in the positive transcriptional regulation of CD70 expression in melanomas. Interestingly. the clinical inhibitor of the common BRAF V600E/D variants. Vemurafenib (PLX-4032). which is currently used to treat melanoma patients with BRAF V600E/D-mutated metastatic melanomas. decreased CD70 expression in human CD70+ melanoma cell lines. This decrease was seen in melanoma cells both with and without the BRAFV600E/D mutation. although was less efficient in those lacking the mutation. But interestingly. by silencing CD70 in CD70+ melanoma cell lines we show that PLX-4032-induced melanoma cell killing and its inhibitory effect on MAPK pathway activation are unaffected by CD70 expression.

Mon étude des rôles régulateurs des GTPases Rho et de leurs inhibiteurs dans le développement des mélanomes s' est décomposée en trois volets:-La mise en évidence de la surexpression membranaire des molécules de CMH de classe I et de costimulation CD80 et CD86 dans les mélanomes murin B16F10 (H-2Kb/TRP-2) et humain LB1319-MEL (HLA-A0201/MelanA-MART1). Nous avons montré que le traitement de ces mélanomes avec des inhibiteurs de GTPases Rho (statines. inhibiteur de la géranylgéranyltransférase et C3 exoenzyme) les rendaient plus immunogéniques et capables d'induire d'une part des LT CD8+ cytotoxiques anti-tumoraux à partir de PBMC naïfs et d'autre part de vacciner des souris naïves.

It drives metastasis via its interaction with the integrin signaling pathway. contributes to tumor progression and confers therapy resistance by providing a physical barrier around the tumor. The complexity of the ECM lies in its heterogeneous composition and complex glycosylation that can provide a support matrix as well as trigger oncogenic signaling pathways by interacting with the tumor cells. In this review. we attempt to dissect the role of the ECM in enriching for the treatment refractory cancer stem cell population and how it may be involved in regulating their metabolic needs.

For the latter. measuring the ion current fluctuation can provide some information about the mode of transport of charged molecules penetrating the proteins.

Recently. we proposed to use the diffusion potential for charged molecules created by their difference in electrophoretic mobility while crossing the outer membrane channel under a concentration gradient. The latter provides semiquantitative values. but the current available setups require large volumes and thus exclude several classes of molecules. Here we propose a simple approach of capturing proteoliposomes at the aperture of glass surface (planar aperture or conical glass capillary) by decreasing the necessary volume below 50 μL. We measured the transport of two charged molecules sulbactam and ceftazidime across the two major porins in Escherichia coli.

To investigate the role of membrane channels in the uptake of antibiotics. we present an approach using fusion of native outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) into a planar lipid bilayer. allowing characterization of membrane protein channels in their native environment. Two major membrane channels from E. coli. OmpF and OmpC. were overexpressed from the host and the corresponding OMVs were collected.

However. the molecular basis of this early malignant susceptibility remains unknown. During Drosophila development. neural stem cells (NSCs) divide asymmetrically and generate intermediate progenitors that rapidly differentiate in neurons. Upon gene inactivation. these progeny can dedifferentiate and generate malignant tumors. Here. we find that intermediate progenitors are prone to malignancy only when born during an early window of development while expressing the transcription factor Chinmo. and the mRNA-binding proteins Imp/IGF2BP and Lin-28. These genes compose an oncogenic module that is coopted upon dedifferentiation of early-born intermediate progenitors to drive unlimited tumor growth. In late larvae. temporal transcription factor progression in NSCs silences the module. thereby limiting mitotic potential and terminating the window of malignant susceptibility. Thus. this study identifies the gene regulatory network that confers malignant potential to neural tumors with early developmental origins.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13463.001,True,NTHFLDkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,47,https://elifesciences.org/articles/13463,13626738128809490468,/scholar?cites=13626738128809490468,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/13463.pdf,0,0,0

To address how the marine system may respond to these stresses I designed and analysed a suite of simulations using a state of the art ocean circulation-sea ice-biogeochemical coupled model. By combining physical oceanography. biogeochemistry and general ecology. this thesis attempts to give an interdisciplinary perspective on the simulated regional changes. The approach was to use sensitivity experiments to isolate the stimuli and the response. and to study the underlying mechanisms leading to the response. I was able to address the impacts of three stresses: large scale atmospheric forcing. stormy wind events. and increasing freshwater discharge.(1) In regard to the sensitivity of deep ocean ventilation to changes in large scale atmospheric patterns like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). I find that ventilation within the deep Labrador Sea is sensitive to the NAO. but unlike previously suggested. the lateral oxygen fluxes dominate the ventilation process over air-sea oxygen fluxes.(2) Windy conditions. which are predicted to increase in the Arctic Ocean. are indeed responsible for a large part of the primary production and biogenic carbon export in the Arctic and Subarctic.

Management guidelines currently focus on hepatotoxins (microcystins). Increasing attention is given to other classes. such as neurotoxins (eg. anatoxin-a) and cytotoxins (eg. cylindrospermopsin) due to their potency. Most studies examine the relationship between individual toxin variants and environmental factors. such as nutrients. temperature and light. In summer 2015. we collected samples across Europe to investigate the effect of nutrient and temperature gradients on the variability of toxin production at a continental scale. Direct and indirect effects of temperature were the main drivers of the spatial distribution in the toxins produced by the cyanobacterial community. the toxin concentrations and toxin quota. Generalized linear models showed that a Toxin Diversity Index (TDI) increased with latitude. while it decreased with water stability. Increases in TDI were explained through a significant increase in toxin variants such as MC-YR. anatoxin and cylindrospermopsin. accompanied by a decreasing presence of MC-LR. While global warming continues. the direct and indirect effects of increased lake temperatures will drive changes in the distribution of cyanobacterial toxins in Europe. potentially promoting selection of a few highly toxic species or strains.

1063438,“Sleepers” and “Creepers”: A Theoretical Study of Colony Polymorphisms in the Fungus Metarhizium Related to Insect Pathogenicity and Plant Rhizosphere Colonization,2018,Steven Angelone and Iván Horacio Piña-Torres and Israel Enrique Padilla-Guerrero and Michael J Bidochka,9,Insects,3,104,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Different strains of Metarhizium exhibit a range of polymorphisms in colony phenotypes. These phenotypes range from highly conidiating colonies to colonies that produce relatively more mycelia and few conidia. These different phenotypes are exhibited in infected insects in the soil. In this paper. we provide a theoretical consideration of colony polymorphisms and suggest that these phenotypes represent a range of strategies in the soil that Metarhizium exhibits. We call these different strategies “sleepers” and “creepers”. The “sleeper” phenotype produces relatively greater amounts of conidia. We use the term “sleeper” to identify this phenotype since this strategy is to remain in the soil as conidia in a relatively metabolically inactive state until a host insect or plant encounter these conidia. The “creeper” phenotype is predominantly a mycelial phenotype. In this strategy. hyphae move through the soil until a host insect or plant is encountered. We theoretically model the costs and benefits of these phenotypic polymorphisms and suggest how evolution could possibly select for these different strategies.

Perfusion with adrenalin or the β-agonist isoprenaline produced an increase in TGL activity and a fall in GPAT activity. These changes could be imitated by incubation of heart homogenates with cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The α2-agonist clondine produced the opposite effect. thus it increased GPAT activity and decreased TGL activity. Methoxamine. an α1-agonist. had no effect on TGL activity but reduced GPAT activity. Continuous perfusion of the β-antagonist atenolol reduced TGL activity to half that found in controls but also reduced GPAT activity.

Un type de récepteurs exprimés chez les DC myéloïdes. les lectines membranaires. peuvent reconnaître des virus.

Ce travail de thèse a participé à une meilleure caractérisation de l'interaction entre DC-SIGN et la gB. Pour cela nous avons utilisé des mutants de DC-SIGN. de la gB ainsi que des anticorps dirigés contre ces deux protéines. Nous avons aussi analysé les sucres à la surface de la gB et leur importance dans l'interaction avec DC-SIGN. De plus. nous nous sommes intéressés au tropisme du CMV.

The genomic DNA gets damaged due to its continuous exposure to numerous environmental factors including toxicants resulting into development of diverse heritable syndromes which are transferred from one generation to the next. A biological cell always stays under a threat of DNA damage by both the endogenous and exogenous factors. Both natural and anthropogenic toxins enter into the body of an organism through several routes of exposure such as dermal contact. inhalation. ingestion. injection and accidental. The environmental factors inducing DNA damage are termed as genotoxic agents. Production of free radicals in excessive amount decreases the level of cellular antioxidants and further induces an imbalance between antioxidant defense system and free radicals that finally results into a condition called as oxidative stress. They induce their effects by distorting the structure of DNA by breaking of hydrogen bonds involved in DNA strands stabilization. The present review article illustrates the natural and synthetic toxicants mediated DNA damage in different organisms. It has been attempted to include the possible mechanisms involved in these important cascades of events.

Forty-three hydrological stations were sampled within three different areas: the northern Ross Sea (RoME 1). Terra Nova Bay (RoME 2). and the southern Ross Sea (RoME 3). The ecological and photophysiological characteristics of the phytoplankton were investigated (i.e.. size structure. functional groups. PSII maximum quantum efficiency. photoprotective pigments). as related to hydrographic and chemical features. The aim was to identify the mechanisms that modulate phytoplankton blooms. and consequently. the fate of organic materials produced by the blooms. The observed biomass standing stocks were very high (e.g.. integrated chlorophyll-a up to 371 mg m-2 in the top 100 m). Large differences in phytoplankton community composition. relative contribution of functional groups and photosynthetic parameters were observed among the three subsystems. The diatoms (in different physiological status) were the dominant taxa in RoME 1 and RoME 3; in RoME 1. a post-bloom phase was identified. whereas in RoME 3. an active phytoplankton bloom occurred. In RoME 2. diatoms co-occurred with Phaeocystis antarctica. but were vertically segregated by the upper mixed layer. with senescent diatoms dominating in the upper layer. and P. antarctica blooming in the deeper layer.

Nevertheless. the Ross Sea is made up of a complex mosaic of sub-systems. with physical. chemical. and biological features that change on different temporal and spatial scales. Thus. we investigated the phytoplankton community structure of the Ross Sea with a spatial scale. considering the different ecological sub-systems of the region. The total phytoplankton biomass. maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm). size classes. and main functional groups were analyzed in relation to physical–chemical properties of the water column during the austral summer of 2017. Data from our study showed productivity differences between polynyas and other areas. with high values of biomass in Terra Nova Bay (up to 272 mg chl am− 2) and the south-central Ross Sea (up to 177 mg chl am− 2) that contrast with the HNLC nature of the off-shore waters during summer.

In the present study. we evaluated the shortterm (hours) effects of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) addition on the growth and photosynthetic efficiency of the green algae Chlorella sorokiniana (211/8k). Bicarbonate was added to nonaxenic cultures at concentrations of 1. 2. and 3 g L-1 leading to a significant increase in biomass especially at the highest salt concentration (3 g L-1) and also showing a bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect that helped to keep a reduced microbial load in the algal culture.

Bargali,85,Indian Journal of Agricultural Sciences,1,102-108,Indian Council of Agricultural Research,Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population. Globally. rice is grown on 161 million hectares. with an average annual production of 678.7 million tonnes. Drought and salinity are two major abiotic determinants due to high magnitude of their impact and wide occurrence. In the present study rice varieties were analyzed for water and salt stress tolerance at germination and early seedling growth stage. Seeds of three rice varieties (Narendra 1. Sabarmati and Hybrid 312) were collected and kept under four water stress and six salt stress levels. Seed germination. seedling length. dry weight. seed vigor and other parameters were recorded. The results showed that with increasing water stress. germination in all the varieties was delayed and decreased from 68.8% in control to 4.4% in highest stress (-15 bar) level. Dry weight of shoot and root. shoot and root length. fresh weight of stem and root decreased in all rice varieties with the increase in water stress level. Narendra 1and Sabarmati showed better response while Hybrid 312 failed to germinate in all water stress levels. The increase in salt stress also reduced every measured trait significantly in all the varieties. Seed germination decreased from 100% in control to 65% in highest (20 ds/m) salt stress level. Maximum germination percentage (100%) was observed in Hybrid 312 under all the salt stress levels.

Under depleting natural resources. environmental fluctuation and increased risk of epidemic outbreak. the task of sufficient wheat production has become a serious problem. In this study. effect of seed size and water stress was analyzed in three wheat varieties (PBW-154. UP-2338. and UP-2425). Three seed size classes (large. medium. small) of each wheat variety were kept under four water stress levels. It was observed that the shoot length and root length were highly sensitive to water stress and showed minimum growth at highest water stress level. The comparison of varieties. seed size classes and water stress levels showed that in terms of seedling growth variety UP-2338 was more resistant to water stress as compared to other varieties. whereas in terms of germination variety PBW-154 was more resistant. Variety UP-2425 showed maximum reduction in seed germination with increasing water stress (33.3% at-15 bar stress level).

The former was only the second species of Onychophora to be described from Brazil. and is herein redescribed. illustrated. and its taxonomic status revised. Macroperipatus ohausi had only been collected at the type locality. Petrópolis. state of Rio de Janeiro. but has not been found there since its discovery. In 2009 we collected two specimens of this species in an Atlantic rain forest fragment in Nova Iguaçu in RPPN dos Petroleiros (also state of Rio de Janeiro). The color of the new specimens was interpreted and described based on the NBS/ISCC System of Color Designation. and corresponds only weakly to that described in earlier publications on M. ohausi. The identification of M. ohausi was based solely on its morphology and compared with its original description. In addition. a female syntype of M. ohausi deposited in the Zoologisches Museum (Hamburg) was examined. We reinvestigated its external morphology and concluded that the dorsal papillae have been misinterpreted in M. ohausi in previous studies of its integument. The new specimens examined are conspecific with M. ohausi mainly by having conical primary papillae. different sized accessory papillae. and by the number of legs.

However. to date neither qualitative nor quantitative descriptions have been provided for this unique adaptation. Here we investigate the fast oscillatory motion of the oral papillae and the exiting liquid jet that oscillates with frequencies  Hz. Using anatomical images. high speed videography. theoretical analysis and a physical simulacrum we show that this fast oscillatory motion is the result of an elastohydrodynamic instability driven by the interplay between the elasticity of oral papillae and the fast unsteady flow during squirting.

Among many different hypotheses. the “differential pathogen resistance” extinction model posits that Neandertals were disproportionately affected by exposure to novel infectious diseases that were transmitted during the period of spatiotemporal sympatry with modern humans. Comparisons of new archaic hominin paleogenome sequences with modern human genomes have confirmed a history of genetic admixture – and thus direct contact – between humans and Neandertals.

We first present reference assemblies for both a 623.7 Mbp nuclear genome and a 15.4 kbp mitochondrial genome for Strombus pugilis. the West Indian fighting conch. We next detail a method to extract and sequence DNA from conch shells and apply it to conch from Bocas del Toro. Panama across three time periods: recently-eaten and discarded (n=3). Late Holocene (984-1258 BP) archaeological midden (n=5). and a mid-Holocene (5711-7187 BP) paleontological fossil coral reef (n=5). These results are compared to control DNA extracted from live-caught tissue and fresh shells (n=5). Using high-throughput sequencing. we were able to obtain S. pugilis nuclear sequence reads from shells across all age periods: up to 92.5 thousand filtered reads per sample in live-caught shell material. 4.57 thousand for modern discarded shells. 12.1 thousand reads for archaeological shells. and 114 reads in paleontological shells. We confirmed authenticity of the ancient DNA recovered from the archaeological and paleontological shells based on 5.7x higher average frequency of deamination-driven misincorporations and 15% shorter average read lengths compared to the modern shells. Reads also mapped to the S. pugilis mitochondrial genome for all but the paleontological shells. with consistent ratios of mitochondrial to nuclear mapped reads across sample types.

On Madagascar. some subfossil bones of extant lemurs are considerably larger than those of the modern members of their species. but relatively large distances between the subfossil localities and modern samples that have been compared to date makes it impossible to reject the possibility that these size differences more simply reflect pre-existing ecogeographic variation.

The ginkgo plant-derived β-ginkgotide β-gB1 is a highly unusual molecule: Small. hyperdisulfide. and found only in selected ancient plants. It also contains a conserved 16-amino-acid core with three interlocking disulfides. as well as a six-amino-acid inter-cysteine loop 2 suitable for grafting peptide epitopes. However. very little is known about this recently-discovered family of molecules. Here. we report the biophysical and functional characterizations of the β-ginkgotide β-gB1 from G. biloba. A circular dichroism spectroscopy analysis at 90 C and proteolytic treatments of β-gB1 supported that it is hyperstable. Data mining revealed that the β-gB1 loop 2 contains the canonical LC3 interacting region (LIR) motif crucial for selective autophagy. Cell-based assays and pull-down experiments showed that β-gB1 is an adaptogen. able to maintain cellular homeostasis through induced autophagosomes formation and to protect cells by targeting intracellular proteins from stress-mediated damage against hypoxia and the hypoxia-reoxygenation of induced cell death. This is the first report of an LIR-containing peptide natural product. Together. our results suggest that the plant-derived β-ginkgotide is cytoprotective. capable of targeting intracellular proteins. and holds promise as a hyperdisulfide scaffold for engineering peptidyl therapeutics with enhanced structural and metabolic stability.

The hyporheic zone is a ubiquitous. reactive interface between the main channel and its surrounding sediments along the river network. We elaborate on the main physical. biological. and biogeochemical drivers and processes within the hyporheic zone that have been studied by multiple scientific disciplines for almost half a century. These previous efforts have shown that the hyporheic zone is a modulator for most metabolic stream processes and serves as a refuge and habitat for a diverse range of aquatic organisms. It also exerts a major control on river water quality by increasing the contact time with reactive environments. which in turn results in retention and transformation of nutrients. trace organic compounds. fine suspended particles. and microplastics. among others. The paper showcases the critical importance of hyporheic zones. both from a scientific and an applied perspective. and their role in ecosystem services to answer the question of the manuscript title.

The four relatively variable time series were subsequently used to calculate first-order removal rates and retardation coefficients via a one-dimensional reactive transport model. Reversible sorption processes led to substantial retardation of many TrOCs along the investigated hyporheic flow path. Some TrOCs. such as dihydroxy-carbamazepine. O-desmethylvenlafaxine. and venlafaxine. were found to be stable in the HZ. Others were readily removed with half-lives in the first 10 cm of the HZ ranging from 0.1 ± 0.01 h for iopromide to 3.3 ± 0.3 h for tramadol. Removal rate constants of the majority of reactive TrOCs were highest in the first 10 cm of the HZ. where …,True,fFafbIAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,19,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.8b06231,3060891781530583581,/scholar?cites=3060891781530583581,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217908093.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we report an interdisciplinary study designed to address the interplay between environmental drivers and community ecology in a typical ecotone ecosystem: the streambed. Environmental filtering at a micro-scale determined how diversity. productivity and composition of the whole streambed assemblage varied with depth and with the direction of vertical water exchange.

Thus. ibuprofen removal potentials and associated bacteria in the hyporheic zone sediments of an impacted river were investigated. Microbially mediated ibuprofen degradation was determined in oxic sediment microcosms amended with ibuprofen (5. 40. 200. and 400 µM). or ibuprofen and acetate. relative to an un-amended control. Ibuprofen was removed by the original sediment microbial community as well as in ibuprofen-enrichments obtained by re-feeding of ibuprofen. Here. 1-. 2-. 3-hydroxy-and carboxy-ibuprofen were the primary transformation products. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed a significantly higher 16S rRNA abundance in ibuprofen-amended relative to un-amended incubations. Time-resolved microbial community dynamics evaluated by 16S rRNA gene and 16S rRNA analyses revealed many new ibuprofen responsive taxa of the Acidobacteria. Actinobacteria. Bacteroidetes. Gemmatimonadetes. Latescibacteria. and Proteobacteria. Two ibuprofen-degrading strains belonging to the genera Novosphingobium and Pseudomonas were isolated from the ibuprofen-enriched sediments. consuming 400 and 300 µM ibuprofen within three and eight days. respectively. The collective results indicated that the hyporheic zone sediments sustain an efficient biotic (micro-) pollutant degradation potential. and hitherto unknown microbial diversity associated with such (micro) pollutant removal.

Understanding of the ecological implications of these compounds is limited to local scale case studies. partly as a result of technical limitations and a lack of integrative analyses. Here. we apply state-of-the-art instrumentation to analyze a complex suite of EOCs in the streambed of 30 UK streams and their effect on streambed communities. We apply the abundance–body mass (N–M) relationship approach as an integrative metric of the deviation of natural communities from reference status as a result of EOC pollution. Our analysis includes information regarding the N and M for individual prokaryotes. unicellular flagellates and ciliates. meiofauna. and macroinvertebrates. We detect a strong significant dependence of the N–M relationship coefficients with the presence of EOCs in the system. to the point of shielding the effect of other important environmental factors such as temperature. pH. and productivity. However. contrary to other stressors. EOC pollution showed a positive effect on the N–M coefficient in our work. This phenomenon can be largely explained by the increase in large-size tolerant taxa under polluted conditions. We discuss the potential implications of these results in relation to bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes. Our findings shed light on the impact of EOCs on the organization and ecology of the whole streambed community for the first time.

1063591,Transformation of Micropollutants in the Hyporheic Zone,2020,Malte Posselt,,,,,,Hyporheic zones (HZs) are reactive transition regions between rivers and aquifers which are thought to play an important role in the attenuation of micropollutants. Micropollutants are chemical substances such as pharmaceuticals. industrial chemicals or personal care products that are found in trace concentrations in the environment and that can be harmful to organisms. This thesis aimed to narrow the knowledge gap on the environmental fate of wastewater-derived polar organic micropollutants in the aquatic environment. with a specific emphasis on the hyporheic zone. In Paper I an efficient workflow was developed for the in-situ characterization of polar organic micropollutants and their transformation products (TPs) in the hyporheic zone at high spatial and temporal resolution and with minimal disturbance of natural flow paths. A low volume sampling device was combined with a newly developed high throughput-direct injection-UHPLC-MS/MS method. Application in the field revealed significant differences in micropollutant concentrations that varied over small time-and spatial scales. In Paper II the results of a comprehensive field study performed in the urban lowland river Erpe in Berlin. Germany. are presented. The work provided data on in-situ attenuation behavior of 24 micropollutants and TPs. along with novel insights into the spatially-and temporally varying environmental factors which play a major role in controlling in-stream attenuation of micropollutants.

The results show that doxorubicin and vinblastin altered mitochondrial functions as observed by a decrease in respiratory control value. an activation of swelling and overproduction of superoxide anion. Myocardial tissue from doxorubicin treated rats showed a marked increase in malondialdehyde production. a depletion of reduced glutathione contents and an inhibition of catalase and superoxide dismutase activities. Similar results were also observed in liver tissue. Pretreatment of rats with propolis extract (100 mg/kg/day po) (10-4 M ip) administered 4 days prior to doxorubicin (20 mg/kg) and/or vinblastin (2 mg/kg) injection. substantially reduced the peroxidative damage in myocardium and hepatic tissues and markedly restored the tissues catalase and SOD activities.

In this work the kombucha poly-microbial probiotic community was analysed to study its flexibility under different growth conditions. Environmental DNA sequencing revealed a complex and flexible composition of the kombucha microbial culture (KMC) constituting more bacterial and fungal organisms in addition to those found by cultural method. The community comprised bacterial and yeast components including cultured and uncultivable microorganisms. Culturing the KMC under different conditions revealed the core part of the community which included acetobacteria of two genera Komagataeibacter (former Gluconacetobacter) and Gluconobacter. and representatives of several yeast genera among which Brettanomyces/Dekkera and Pichia (including former Issatchenkia) were dominant. Herbaspirillum spp. and Halomonas spp.. which previously had not been described in KMC. were found to be minor but permanent members of the community.

GoLoco domains present in many proteins play important roles in multiple trimeric G protein–dependent activities. physically binding Gα-subunits of the Gαi/o class. In most cases GoLoco binds exclusively to the GDP-loaded form of the Gα-subunits.

We identify Pins GoLoco domain 1 as necessary and sufficient for this unusual interaction with Gαo-GTP.

The Gαs alpha-subunit is involved in the post-eclosion wing maturation. which consists of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell death. accompanied by unfolding of the pupal wing into the firm adult flight organ. Here we show that another alpha-subunit Gαo can specifically antagonize the Gαs activities by competing for the Gβ13F/Gγ1 subunits of the heterotrimeric Gs protein complex. Loss of Gβ13F. Gγ1. or Gαs. but not any other G protein subunit. results in prevention of post-eclosion cell death and failure of the wing expansion. However. cell death prevention alone is not sufficient to induce the expansion defect. suggesting that the failure of epithelial-mesenchymal transition is key to the folded wing phenotypes. Overactivation of Gαs with cholera toxin mimics expression of constitutively activated Gαs and promotes wing blistering due to precocious cell death. In contrast. co-overexpression of Gβ13F and Gγ1 does not produce wing blistering. revealing the passive role of the Gβγ in the Gαs-mediated activation of apoptosis. but hinting at the possible function of Gβγ in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

SELECTION OF STUDIES: Controlled random clinical trials published after NAECC (1994) that evaluated the effect of two levels of PEEP and that reported the mortality and incidence of barotrauma in the series. DATA EXTRACTION: By two investigators working independently. with discrepancies resolved by group consensus. Contingency tables were elaborated and the RRs with corresponding confidence intervals were obtained for each study. RESULTS: Four articles were selected for the meta-analysis of mortality and three for the meta-analysis of barotrauma. No effects of PEEP level on mortality were found (RR 0.73. 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.10) or on the incidence of barotrauma (RR 0.50. 95% CI: 0.14 to 1.73).

Установлено. что пищевая обеспеченность лососей в 2000-е гг. находилась на уровне. достаточном для нормального функционирования популяций. Показано. что высокочисленные подходы лососей могут обусловливать понижение пищевой обеспеченности рыб.

Materials and methods: Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN) tests were used for estimation of genotoxic influences. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level were also measured to evaluate the antioxidative effect of UME. Results: In the SCE and MN test systems. it was observed that UME suppressed the mutagenic effects of AFB_1. Furthermore. an increase of MDA level and a decrease of SOD and GPx activities were observed after AFB_1 treatment. UME eliminated the genotoxicity of AFB_1 and lipid peroxidation by increasing the level of antioxidant enzymes activities. Conclusion: It was shown here for the first time that UME modulates the adverse effects of AFB_1 in human blood cells.

The peculiarities. main advantages. and disadvantages of some modern insecticides are described. The names of the discoverers of some of the most popular insecticide preparations on the world market. are listed. The tendencies to find new insecticides to control the quantity of phytophagous insects are discussed. Special attention is paid to the perspective of creating preparations based on nucleic acids. in particular DNA insecticides. The use of insect-specific. short single-stranded DNA fragments as DNA insecticides. is paving the way in the field of “intellectual” insecticides that “think” before they act. It is worth noting. though. that in the near future. the quantity of produced insecticides will increase due to the challenges associated with food production for a rapidly growing population. It is concluded. that an agreeable interaction of scientists and manufacturers of insecticides should lead to the selection of the most optimal solutions for insect pest control. which would be safe. affordable. and effective at the same time.,True,kHrjPKoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,50,http://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/show-content?id=89645&,1828939051597931056,/scholar?cites=1828939051597931056,,http://journals.pan.pl/Content/89645/PDF/JPPR_55%283%29_0R1_Oberemok.pdf,0,0,0

In our experiments gypsy moth showed significant susceptibility to applied DNA insecticides on the basis of BIR and RING domains fragments of LdMNPV IAP-3. whereas common fruit fly and tobacco hornworm did not. PCR with the same fragments of BIR and RING domains of the LdMNPV IAP-3 gene as primers revealed parts of the genomes of gypsy moth. common fruit fly. and tobacco hornworm. Part of the gypsy moth genome cloned with the fragments of BIR and RING domains of the LdMNPV IAP-3 gene as primers has an overlap with the corresponding part of the LdMNPV IAP-3 gene and Lymantria dispar IAP-1 mRNA for an inhibitor of apoptosis protein with the high cover of the latter by query. which allows assuming that we cloned a part of a gypsy moth antiapoptosis gene.

An essential part is attributed to the sex-lethal gene that depends on the expression of the X: A (number of chromosomes to autosomes) ratio signal controlling both sex selection and dosage compensation processes in D. melanogaster. Interestingly. for sex selection in D. melanogaster there are no documented data addressing the role of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) genes and their signaling influence on this biological process. In this study. we found that topical application of a 20-nucleotide-long antisense DNA fragment (oligoDIAP-2) from the death-associated inhibitor of apoptosis (DIAP)-2 gene interferes with D. melanogaster development and significantly decreases the number of female imagos and their biomass. We show that the applied antisense oligoDIAP-2 fragment downregulates the target DIAP-2 gene whose normal concentration is necessary for the development of female D. melanogaster. These data correspond to the results on downregulation of the target host IAP-Z gene of Lymantria dispar L. female imagos after topical treatment with an 18-nucleotide-long antisense DNA fragment from the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus IAP-3 gene at the larval stage.

Due to rapid population growth. the primary task is to increase food production. Beyond abiotic factors (drought. soil salinity. etc.) that reduce crop yields. farmers face problems with insect pests that can decrease crop productivity up to 60%. Also. insects are carriers of severe viral and protozoan human diseases. The need for application of insecticides is not questioned but many of them cause resistance of insect pests to them. This. in turn. leads to the necessity to invent new insecticides that are safe and more effective for long-term use.

We propose a novel four-stage approach for automated estimation of building heights from their shadows in very high resolution (VHR) multispectral images. First. a building's actual shadow regions are detected by applying ratio-band algorithm to the VHR image. Second. 2-D building footprint geometries are identified using graph theory and morphological fuzzy processing techniques. Third. artificial shadow regions are simulated using the identified building footprint and solar information in the image metadata at predefined height increments. Finally. the difference between the actual and simulated shadow regions at every height increment is computed using Jaccard similarity coefficient. The estimated building height corresponds to the height of the simulated shadow region that resulted in the maximum value for Jaccard index.

Shadow in the VHR satellite imageries provides vital information on urban construction forms. illumination direction. and the spatial distribution of the objects that can help to further understanding of the built environment. However. to extract shadows. the automated detection of shadows from images must be accurate. This paper reviews current automatic approaches that have been used for shadow detection from VHR satellite images and comprises two main parts. In the first part. shadow concepts are presented in terms of shadow appearance in the VHR satellite imageries. current shadow detection methods. and the usefulness of shadow detection in urban environments. In the second part. we adopted two approaches which are considered current state-of-the-art shadow detection. and segmentation algorithms using WorldView-3 and Quickbird images. In the first approach. the ratios between the NIR and visible bands were computed on a pixel-by-pixel basis. which allows for disambiguation between shadows and dark objects. To obtain an accurate shadow candidate map. we further refine the shadow map after applying the ratio algorithm on the Quickbird image. The second selected approach is the GrabCut segmentation approach for examining its performance in detecting the shadow regions of urban objects using the true colour image from WorldView-3. Further refinement was applied to attain a segmented shadow map.

Animal Science & Biotechnologies,1,,,In an integrated aquaponic system. the ratio between nitrogen production and plant assimilation is a key factor for system efficiency. That is why plant density is very important to be appropriate. The aim of this study is to expose the performances of growth parameters. both in terms of quantity and quality. for Nores variety spinach (Spinacia oleracea) produced in an aquaponic integrated system along with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). under three plant densities (V1-59 plants/m2. V2-48plants/m2 and V3-39plants/m2). The experimental design consists in a recirculating aquaculture system with 12 growing units. mechanical and biological water treatment units and four aquaponic units. Three plants densities were used (59. 48 and 39plants/m2). A fish stocking density of 136fish/m3 was used. Plants initial and final biomass was taken and a series of periodic measurements were made. Chlorophyll a. b and carotenoids. ash and dry matter were determined from spinach leaf. The plant biomass gain registered good values and the quality of final plant products. given by the chlorophyll a. b. carotenoids and dry matter content were in the optimal variation interval. comparing to market spinach. Significant differences (p< 0.05) between variants were observed.

However. the integration of these compounds into the context of known metabolism remains difficult. To address this challenge of incomplete knowledge. we propose a computational approach that identifies novel hypothetical reactions between known metabolites. integrates experimentally measured molecular structures into existing metabolic networks. and finally predicts chemical compounds that are probable to exist in metabolism. The computational framework BNICE. ch is used to exploit the known biochemistry contained in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We summarize the vastly diverse functionalities of enzymatic reactions in a few hundred expert-curated reaction rules. each generalizing multiple biochemical reactions. We then apply these rules to all metabolites known to KEGG in order to create a database of all the biochemically plausible reactions between compounds reported to occur in living organism. This extrapolation of the known metabolism results in a network of more than 130’000 known and novel reactions. each connecting two or more KEGG compounds.

Here. we used landscape genetics methods to assess the genetic structure of the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). which is a frequent vector of rabies. a lethal zoonosis of great concern for public health. Our main objective was to identify landscape elements shaping the genetic structure of this species in Southern Québec. Canada. in an area where the raccoon rabies variant has been detected. We hypothesised that geographic distance and landscape barriers. such as highways and major rivers. would modulate genetic structure. We genotyped a total of 289 individuals sampled across a large area (22.000 km2) at nice microsatellite loci. Genetic structure analyses identified a single genetic cluster in the study area. Major rivers and highways. however. influenced the genetic relatedness among sampled individuals. Sex-specific analyses revealed that rivers significantly limited dispersal only for females while highways only had marginal effects. Rivers and highways did not significantly affect male dispersal. These results support the contention that female skunks are more philopatric than males.

Such studies are often conducted on uninfected hosts because acute zoonotic diseases pose significant health risks to humans and infected hosts are thus more difficult to obtain. Predictions of disease spread potential assume that infected and uninfected individuals exhibit similar movement behaviours and genotypes. However. some diseases. such as rabies. might enhance individual's dispersal behaviour. Thus. if rabid animals are mostly long-distance migrants. prediction of rabies spread potential based on genetic analyses of uninfected animals might be misleading.

1063813,Staphylococcus aureus toxins and their molecular activity in infectious diseases,2018,Diana Oliveira and Anabela Borges and Manuel Simões,10,,6,252,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Staphylococcus aureus is a microorganism resident in the skin and nasal membranes with a dreadful pathogenic potential to cause a variety of community and hospital-acquired infections. The frequency of these infections is increasing and their treatment is becoming more difficult. The ability of S. aureus to form biofilms and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains are the main reasons determining the challenge in dealing with these infections. S. aureus' infectious capacity and its success as a pathogen is related to the expression of virulence factors. among which the production of a wide variety of toxins is highlighted. For this reason. a better understanding of S. aureus toxins is needed to enable the development of new strategies to reduce their production and consequently improve therapeutic approaches. This review focuses on understanding the toxin-based pathogenesis of S. aureus and their role on infectious diseases.

This interconnection favors the transmission of bacteria and other infectious agents as well as the flow of genetic elements containing antibiotic resistance genes. This problem is worsened when pathogenic bacteria have the ability to establish as biofilms. Therefore. it is important to understand the characteristics and behaviour of microorganisms in both planktonic and biofilms states from the most diverse environmental niches to mitigate the emergence and dissemination of resistance.The purpose of this work was to assess the antibiotic susceptibility of four bacteria (Acinetobacter spp.. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pseudomonas fluorescens and Shewanella putrefaciens) isolated from wild animals and their ability to form biofilms. The effect of two antibiotics. imipenem (IPM) and ciprofloxacin (CIP). on biofilm removal was also assessed. Screening of resistance genetic determinants was performed by PCR. Biofilm tests were performed by a modified microtiter plate method. Bacterial surface hydrophobicity was determined by sessile drop contact angles.The susceptibility profile classified the bacteria as multidrug-resistant. Three genes coding for β-lactamases were detected in K. pneumoniae (TEM. SHV. OXA-aer) and one in P. fluorescens (OXA-aer).

Advanced materials are promising tools that can be combined with innovative alternatives to conventional antibiotics to allow more targeted and efficient treatment. In this work. we explored the activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) of the α-helical antimicrobial peptide (AMP) MSI-78 (4-20)(KFLKKAKKFGKAFVKIL) when covalently bound to a chitosan coating. The AMP MSI-78 (4-20)(17 mer) is an improved version of its parent MSI-78 (22 mer; commercially known as Pexiganan). a cost-effective short AMP. which was demonstrated to be as effective as MSI-78 and less toxic to eukaryotic cells. An MSI-78 (4-20)–chitosan coating could be applied in several infection scenarios. ranging from bone implants to wound dressings. as chitosan possesses osteoconductive and hemostatic properties. Cysteine-modified MSI-78 (4-20) was covalently immobilized onto the chitosan coating through a succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)-octaethyleneglycol] ester (SM (PEG) 8). a heterobifuncional crosslinker. with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester and maleimide groups. by its N-and C-termini. The MSI-78 (4-20)–chitosan coating demonstrated bactericidal properties independently of the tethering site and an improved performance in the presence of plasma proteins. which mimics conditions that will be encountered in vivo.

Consequently. inhibiting QS is being considered a promising target for antipathogenic/anti-virulence therapies. This study aims to screen 2-nitrovinylfuran derivatives structurally related to Furvina (a broad-spectrum antibiotic already used for therapeutic purposes) for their effects on QS and in biofilm prevention/control. Furvina and four 2-nitrovinylfuran derivatives (compounds 1–4) were tested to assess the ability to interfere with QS of Staphylococcus aureus using bioreporter strains (S. aureus ALC1742 and ALC1743). The activity of Furvina and the most promising quorum-sensing inhibitor (QSI) was evaluated in biofilm prevention and in biofilm control (combined with fusidic acid). The biofilms were further characterized in terms of biofilm mass. viability and membrane integrity. Compound 2 caused the most significant QS inhibition with reductions between 60% and 80%. Molecular docking simulations indicate that this compound interacts preferentially with the protein hydrophobic cleft in the LytTR domain of AgrA pocket. Metabolic inactivations of 40% for S. aureus ALC1742 and 20% for S. aureus ALC1743 were reached. A 24 h-old biofilm formed in the presence of the QSI increased the metabolic inactivation by fusidic acid to 80%. for both strains. The overall results highlight the effects of compound 2 as well as the potential of combining QSI with in-use antibiotics for the management of skin and soft tissues infections.

They affect approximately 3% of the people with more than 60 years and are mostly associated with diabetic foot. pressure ulcers. blood vessels or trauma1. Besides that. it is expected that 578 million people worldwide will suffer from the disease by 2030. that will subsequently increase the risk of developing infection and potentially result in amputation or osteomyelitis2. One of the main difficulties in the wound healing process is the fact that bacteria persist due to biofilm formation. Biofilms delay not only healing. but they also make bacteria more resistant to the antimicrobial therapy. Among the bacteria present at the wound site. Staphylococcus aureus was found to be one of the most prevalent biofilm producers3. In this sense. other alternatives to fight biofilm infections should be considered due to the resistance to the current antibiotics. One possible strategy consists of using antibiotic adjuvants to enhance the activity of current drugs and to minimize or even block resistance. For that. plants are used as a resource of such adjuvant compounds. The use of natural compounds from plants have been applied in skin wound care for millennials. generating a lot of interest from the scientific community.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) immobilization on biomaterial coatings appears as a promising strategy to prevent implant bacterial colonization. Thus. we propose the development of an antimicrobial coating based on the covalent immobilization of the peptide MSI-78 (4-20) onto a chitosan thin film. MSI-78 (4-20) is a short AMP. a 17-mer peptide. derived from the well-known MSI-78 (22-mer). which demonstrated to be as effective and less toxic than the parent AMP. Chitosan was chosen as it is a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer with antibacterial properties. MSI-78 (4-20) modified with a cysteine.(Cys-Ahx-MSI-78 (4-20)). was covalently immobilized on chitosan films using SM (PEG) 8. a heterobiofuncional crosslinker with a N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester and a maleimide group that allow conjugation with the amines of the chitosan and the sulfhydryl group of the peptide. respectively.The surfaces were characterized using ellipsometry. water contact angle and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity was studied by challenging the coating with Staphylococcus epidermidis. one of the most prevalent strains in implant associated infections.

The control group (group 1) received oral gavage administration of normal saline (1 ml/kg/day for 90 consecutive days) while group II and group III received rosuvastatin (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg/day respectively for 90 consecutive days). Group IV received only the vehicle (carboxymethyl cellulose. 0.25% mg/kg/day) for 90 consecutive days. Liver biopsy was taken form each rat under study for histological and histochemical examination. In comparison with respective control rats. ROSU-treated animals exhibited nuclear abnormalities. dilatation of blood sinusoids and central veins. inflammatory cell infiltration. necrosis. apoptosis. congestion and hydropic degeneration. Also. ROSU exposure increased the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with no change in the activity of alkaline phosphatase together with deletion in protein and glycogen hepatocytes content. The histological and histochemical alterations produced by ROSU might indicate hepatocytes insulation due to metabolic and structural disturbances caused by this drug.

J. Pharm. Res.,7,,,Purpose: To investigate the protective effect of vitamin E (Vit E) and selenium (Se) combination against gentamycin (GM)-induced renal and hepatic toxicity in rats. Methods: Forty-eight male Wistar albino rats were administrated GM at a dose of 80 mg/kg/day. with or without Se (1.5 mg/kg/day). and/or Vit E (250 mg/kg/day) for a period of 4 weeks. Serum samples from each rat were subjected to biochemical analysis for kidney and liver functions. while kidney and liver biopsies were also investigated by histological examination. Results: GM significantly increased serum creatinine. urea. alanine aminotransferase (ALT). aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and free radicals (p< 0.05). Moreover. GM induced significant histological and ultrastructural alterations in the renal and hepatic tissues of the rats. Exposure to a combination of Vit E and Se did not attenuate the GM-induced toxicity in renal and hepatic tissues.

1063833,Protective Effect of Gum Arabic/Insulin Against Histological Changes in Testes of Diabetic Rats.,2020,Amin Abdullah Al-Doaiss and Mohammed Ali Al-Shehri,38,International Journal of Morphology,2,,,Diabetes mellitus is a serious disease with a high incidence of occurrence in our community. Gum Arabic (GA) is a branched-chain polysaccharide which has strong antioxidant properties. and has been used to reduce the experimental toxicity. Yet. the effects of GA on testicular tissue in type I diabetic rats have not been enough investigated. This study was designed to investigate histological changes in testes of male Wistar rats and investigate the protective potential of GA against diabetes-induced testicular toxicity in rats. Fifty adult male Wistar rats were assigned into five groups (n= 10 of each): Group 1 (non-diabetic rats) served as control. Group 2 served as diabetic group injected with Alloxan. Group 3 diabetic group plus insulin. Group 4 diabetic group given 15% GA in drinking water and Group 5 diabetic group plus insulin and GA for 4 weeks. Compared to control group. histopathological examinations of testicular tissue from the diabetic rats group. showed degeneration. necrosis and atrophy of seminiferous with presence of giant cells. Necrosis and hemorrhage in the renal tissue. On the other hand. treatment with GA ameliorated all the previous histological changes. Overall. oral administration of GA alone or with insulin daily for 4 weeks successfully ameliorated the testicular histological changes. These data demonstrated that GA significantly improved diabetes complication in rat testis. This study suggested that GA might have a protective effect against oxidative stress-induced impaired testicular functions in diabetic rats. The possible mechanisms of this action might be ascribed to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.,True,OpaKZEEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amin-Al-Doaiss/publication/340354235_Protective_Effect_of_Gum_ArabicInsulin_Against_Histological_Changes_in_Testes_of_Diabetic_Rats/links/5efb458ca6fdcc4ca43dbd8c/Protective-Effect-of-Gum-Arabic-Insulin-Against-Histological-Changes-in-Testes-of-Diabetic-Rats.pdf,11139052761793518164,/scholar?cites=11139052761793518164,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Amin-Al-Doaiss/publication/340354235_Protective_Effect_of_Gum_ArabicInsulin_Against_Histological_Changes_in_Testes_of_Diabetic_Rats/links/5efb458ca6fdcc4ca43dbd8c/Protective-Effect-of-Gum-Arabic-Insulin-Against-Histological-Changes-in-Testes-of-Diabetic-Rats.pdf,0,0,0

A total of 40 healthy male adult Wistar albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) were exposed to TiO2 NPs (126. 252. 378 mg/kg bw) for 24 and 48 h. Fresh portions of the kidneys from each rat were processed for histological and histochemical alterations.

Dementia is a worldwide concern. with an estimated 135 million people living with the diagnosis by 2050. As an umbrella term. the ‘dementias’ include several variations that are characterized not only (and in some instances not even) by loss of memory. as is public perception. but also significant impairment of language and communication and relating in the world.There has been little impetus to provide specialist services for YOD in the UK. where services for older people can have a detrimental effect on a younger person (Burton-Jones. 2015). The body politics of age reverberate when people are mid-life and mid-career. often with families and living actively at the time of diagnosis. The medicalization of dementia framed as a pathological condition. while intended to reduce stigma and taboo. has often resulted in more stigmatization. A biomedical bias emphasizes cognitive deterioration and does not take into account personal and social experiences where it is understood that affective resonance endures (Allegranti. 2019).

Its underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that phosphorylation might regulate maspin localization and function. Using two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis with different focusing power followed by Western blot we identified four different maspin forms with the same molecular weight (42 kDa). but different isoelectric points. Three of these forms were sensitive to acidic phosphatase treatment. suggesting that they are phosphorylated.

Initially described as a tumor and metastasis suppressor. clinical data brought controversies to the field. as some studies reported no correlation between SerpinB5 expression and prognosis value. These data underscore the importance of understanding SerpinB5 function in a normal physiological context and the molecular mechanism involved. Several SerpinB5 phosphoforms have been detected in different cell lines. but the signaling pathways involved and the biological significance of this post-translational modification in vivo remains to be explored. In this study we investigated SerpinB5 expression. subcellular localization and phosphorylation in different stages of the mouse mammary gland development and the signaling pathway involved. Here we show that SerpinB5 is first detected in late pregnancy. reaches its highest levels in lactation and remains at constant levels during post-lactational regression (involution). Using high resolution isoelectric focusing followed but immunoblot. we found at least 8 different phosphoforms of SerpinB5 during lactation. which decreases steadily at the onset of involution. In order to investigate the signaling pathway involved in SerpinB5 phosphorylation. we took advantage of the non-transformed MCF-10A model system. as we have previously observed SerpinB5 phosphorylation in these cells.

Foi classificada como uma serpina devido à homologia na sequência de aminoácidos. porém. maspina não apresenta atividade de inibição de serina proteases. Entre os efeitos biológicos de maspina estão a modulação da adesão. a inibição do crescimento e a invasão tumoral. a inibição da angiogênese. o efeito pró-apoptótico e o controle da resposta ao stress oxidativo. propriedades que contribuem para supressão tumoral. Esta diversidade de funções se reflete nos inúmeros ligantes de maspina e na sua localização subcelular. já que é encontrada na membrana plasmática. no citoplasma. núcleo e mitocôndrias. A localização subcelular de maspina guarda importante relação com sua função. já que foi demonstrado que sua localização nuclear está correlacionada com bom prognóstico em diversos tumores e seu efeito supressor de tumor foi observado somente quando maspina está localizada no núcleo.

Several mathematical models have been developed for identifying the interactions between tumor cells and tissue microenvironment. since they play an important role in tumor formation and progression. Toward this direction we propose a new continuum model of avascular glioma-tumor growth. which incorporates a new factor. namely. the glycolytic potential of cancer cells. to express the interactions of three different tumor-cell populations (proliferative. hypoxic. and necrotic) with their tissue microenvironment. The glycolytic potential engages three vital nutrients. i.e.. oxygen. glucose. and lactate. which provide cells with the necessary energy for their survival and proliferation.

We combine this with the use of a widefield Airy beam to achieve high-resolution imaging over extended fields of view and depths. We characterise our method on fluorescent beads as test targets. We then demonstrate improvements in imaging amyloid plaques in a cleared brain from a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. and in excised healthy and cancerous colon and breast tissues.

1063890,The effects of dietary Egyptian propolis and bee pollen supplementation against toxicity if sodium fluoride in rats,2010,Fatma A Khalil and Nora M El-Sheikh,11,Journal of American Science,6,310-316,,Propolis and bee pollen are substances produced by honey bees its components are strong antioxidant and free radical scavengers. The present study aimed to study the protective effects of propolis and bee pollen supplementation against toxicity of sodium fluoride in rats. After the end of experimental period. the rats sacrified and biochemical analysis were carried out. The results showed that the administration of fluoride (F) alone causes significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) level and significant decrease of antioxidant system as erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in blood and brain. Also F causes significant increase alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. urea. creatinine. sodium and potassium levels. And significant decrease total protein. calcium. magnesium and phosphorus levels as compared to control group (P< 0.05). Whereas administration of propolis or bee pollen with F led to significant decrease in MDA level and significant increase in SOD activity. GSH levels in blood and brain. And significant decrease ALP activity. urea. creatinine. sodium and potassium levels in serum.

Feeding rats a methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet had served as a nutritional model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In this study. we aimed to evaluate the probable effect of turmeric and silymarin with high polyphenolic content on experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into equal four groups: group 1. as control was fed on methionine choline-sufficient (MCS) diet; group 2 was fed on MCD diet; group 3 was fed on MCD diet supplemented with 1% turmeric and group 4 was fed on MCD diet supplemented with 1% silymarin. MCD diet-fed rats developed steatohepatitis at week 6 due to hepatic lipid accumulation. MCD diet induced hepatic damage was manifested by a significant increase in serum activities of the enzymes [alanine transaminase (ALT). aspartate transaminase (AST). gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALK-P)] in addition to products of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. TBARS). A significant decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH) content was observed. Treatment of rats with turmeric and silymarin reversed these altered parameters towards normal values. Histological evaluation of the liver samples revealed that turmeric and silymarin had abated the severity of steatosis among the MCD-fed rats. These results suggest that turmeric and silymarin protect against NAFLD by limiting hepatic lipid accumulation and liver injury mainly due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.,True,hcUWrtoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,9,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nora_El-Sheikh2/publication/318135479_Counteracting_Methionine_Choline-Deficient_Diet-induced_Fatty_Liver_by_Administration_of_Turmeric_and_Silymarin/links/5935e9b60f7e9beee7eace7f/Counteracting-Methionine-Choline-Deficient-Diet-induced-Fatty-Liver-by-Administration-of-Turmeric-and-Silymarin.pdf,15762747070716322805,/scholar?cites=15762747070716322805,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nora_El-Sheikh2/publication/318135479_Counteracting_Methionine_Choline-Deficient_Diet-induced_Fatty_Liver_by_Administration_of_Turmeric_and_Silymarin/links/5935e9b60f7e9beee7eace7f/Counteracting-Methionine-Choline-Deficient-Diet-induced-Fatty-Liver-by-Administration-of-Turmeric-and-Silymarin.pdf,0,0,0

However. the expression levels of PKS pathway genes were not significantly regulated as the DHA content increased. Further. gene expression analysis showed that pathways related to the production of substrates (acetyl-CoA and NADPH) for fatty acid synthesis (the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway) and genes related to saturated fatty acid biosynthesis (the FAS pathway genes and malic enzyme) were. respectively. upregulated and downregulated.

1063947,Interactions between ethylene and auxin are crucial to the control of grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berry ripening,2013,Christine Böttcher and Crista A Burbidge and Paul K Boss and Christopher Davies,13,BMC plant biology,1,1-14,BioMed Central,Fruit development is controlled by plant hormones. but the role of hormone interactions during fruit ripening is poorly understood. Interactions between ethylene and the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) are likely to be crucial during the ripening process. since both hormones have been shown to be implicated in the control of ripening in a range of different fruit species. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) homologues of the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE RELATED (TAR) and YUCCA families. functioning in the only characterized pathway of auxin biosynthesis. were identified and the expression of several TAR genes was shown to be induced by the pre-ripening application of the ethylene-releasing compound Ethrel. The induction of TAR expression was accompanied by increased IAA and IAA-Asp concentrations. indicative of an upregulation of auxin biosynthesis and conjugation. Exposure of ex planta. pre-ripening berries to the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine resulted in decreased IAA and IAA-Asp concentrations. The delayed initiation of ripening observed in Ethrel-treated berries might therefore represent an indirect ethylene effect mediated by increased auxin concentrations. During berry development. the expression of three TAR genes and one YUCCA gene was upregulated at the time of ripening initiation and/or during ripening. This increase in auxin biosynthesis gene expression was preceded by high expression levels of the ethylene biosynthesis genes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase.

Recent reports of greatly increased cytokinin concentrations in the flesh of ripening kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C.F. Liang & A.R.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse Lyell's biogeographical model in terms of its own internal structure. Lyell tried to explain the distribution of organisms by appealing to a real cause (climate). However. he was aware that environmental conditions were clearly insufficient to explain the existence of biogeographical regions. Lyell's adherence to ecological determinism generated strong tensions within his biogeographical model. He shifted from granting a secondary weight to dispersal to assigning it a major role. By doing so. Lyell was led into an evident contradiction. A permanent tension in Lyell's ideas was generated by the prevalent explanatory pattern of his time.

Sin embargo. después de analizar dichas ideas tanto en su contexto biológico original como en el ámbito social al que fueron trasplantadas. concluimos que tal afirmación solo puede aceptarse en un sentido laxo.

Conocer las repercusiones del darwinismo fuera de su ámbito original contribuye a entender cómo se dio el complejo e inevitable interjuego entre ciencia. sociedad y política. Aunque la apropiación que hicieron Riva Palacio y Molina de las ideas darwinistas no tuvo rigor conceptual ni metodológico. contribuyó a la construcción ideológica del mestizo como una raza evolutivamente avanzada.

Alfred Wegener fue el primero en elaborar una explicación coherente sobre el desplazamiento de los continentes. Soldado del ejército alemán. profesor de meteorología y viajero incansable. Wegener fue capaz de desarrollar una teoría geológica completamente audaz y novedosa a partir de evidencias paleontológicas. geológicas y geofísicas. En este trabajo se hace una breve reconstrucción histórica del surgimiento y desarrollo de la teoría de la deriva continental. Inicialmente suscitó una fuerte polémica entre las comunidades de geólogos. paleontólogos y geofísicos. El desarrollo ulterior de los estudios paleomagnéticos condujo a la moderna teoría de la tectónica de placas. La teoría de Wegener fue incapaz de desarrollar una explicación convincente sobre el mecanismo de los movimientos horizontales de la superficie terrestre. La tectónica de placas por el contrario surgió como resultado de los estudios del fondo oceánico y paleomagnéticos. que se convirtieron en la evidencia empírica que da sustento al movimiento de las placas tectónicas.

The degree of intervessel contacts and the lateral exchange capability within and between sectors were examined and correlated in different xeric shrubs. A dye injection method was used to detect the connections between vessels; an apoplastic dye was sucked through a known number of vessels and its distribution in the xylem network was followed. Hydraulic techniques were used to measure axial and tangential conductivity both within and between xylem sectors. The intra- and inter-sector integration indexes were then determined as the ratio of tangential to axial conductance. Species differed significantly in the degree of intervessel contacts. intra- and inter-sector integration index.

Algeria). from 2 to 4 million palms of it spaces in the last decade seems to have permitted a fast colonization by the Colombidae. During five and half months in 2008. from the end of March until the end of August. we led the observations and a regular follow-up in order to surround the main parameters of the nest building and reproduction among the doves Streptopelia decaocto and S. turtur. We followed the activity of two samples of reference. composed of N1= 21 nests of S decaocto and N2= 30 nests of S. turtur. The nests were constructed by two varieties of date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera): Mech degla and Deglet nour. The respective mean heights of the nests for S. decaocto were HST1= 6. 11±1.006 m (N= 14) and HST2= 4. 57±1. 12m (N= 7). While. the mean heights of S. turtur were HSB1= 5. 28±1. 15m (N= 16) and HSB2= 4. 04±1. 29m.(N= 14). The global breeding success for the two species of doves was homogeneous enough; it oscillated between 0. 50 for S. decaocto and 0. 56 for S. turtur.

1064005,Isolation and molecular analysis of SRBSDV isolates infecting rice in Vietnam,2013,Thanh Tran Ngoc and Hoang Anh Ta and Vinh Do Nang and Neeti Sanan-Mishra,1,Asian Journal of Agriculture and Food Sciences,5,,,Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) is a newly described member of the sub-group 2 in the genus Fijivirus. family Reoviridae. SRBSDV genome has 10 segments encoding 13 opened reading frames (ORFs). In this study we cloned and sequenced 6 ORFs from SRBSDV isolates collected from 3 provinces in Vietnam. The sequence analysis suggested that SRBSDV populations in North Vietnam are closely related to those in South China. The viral isolates from Nghe-An and Quang-Tri provinces of Vietnam were closer to each other as compared to the Quang-Ngai province suggesting that the virus seems to be evolving while spreading in a southern direction. Moreover the analysis revealed the presence of DNA binding domains in gene 5.2 indicating that it may be playing an important role in the viral life cycle.,True,eIrbotsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/34207703/my_paper_isolated.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34207703/my_paper_isolated.pdf,0,0,0

In the present work. a continuum solvation based model is developed to explore the impact of salt on protein stability. This model relies on a traditional Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) term to describe the polar or electrostatic effects of salt. and a surface area dependent term containing a salt concentration dependent microscopic surface tension function to capture the non-polar Hofmeister effects. The model is first validated against a series of cold-shock protein variants whose salt-dependent protein fold stability profiles have been previously determined experimentally. The approach is then applied to HIV-1 protease in order to explain an experimentally observed enhancement in stability and activity at high (1M) NaCl concentration. The inclusion of the salt-dependent non-polar term brings the model into quantitative agreement with experiment. and provides the basis for further studies into the impact of ionic strength on protein structure. function. and evolution.,True,KnaDzcAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,24,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be46/15ef3e8f39cecefa76a3663a44a1c45b2b3e.pdf,5148097333246377539,/scholar?cites=5148097333246377539,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/be46/15ef3e8f39cecefa76a3663a44a1c45b2b3e.pdf,0,0,0

An inventory of over 6000 discrete organic chemicals used as fragrance materials in consumer products has been clustered into chemical class-based groups for efficient search of read-across sources. We developed a robust. tiered system for chemical classification based on (1) organic functional group. (2) structural similarity and reactivity features of the hydrocarbon skeletons.

1064041,Lipid bilayer stress-activated IRE-1 modulates autophagy during endoplasmic reticulum stress,2018,Guillaume Thibault Jhee Hong Koh and Lei Wang and Caroline Beaudoin-Chabot,131,,,1-12,The Company of Biologists,Metabolic disorders. such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). are emerging as epidemics that affect the global population. One facet of these disorders is attributed to the disturbance of membrane lipid composition. Perturbation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis through alteration in membrane phospholipids activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) and causes dramatic transcriptional and translational changes in the cell. To restore cellular homeostasis. the three highly conserved UPR transducers ATF6.

Friedreich’s ataxia and other neurological conditions. The reinforcement is achieved by substituting the atoms of hydrogen at the bis-allylic methylene of these essential fatty acids with the isotope deuterium. This substitution leads to stronger chemical bonds and. hence. the prevention of substantial chemical damage. This approach has the advantage of preventing the harmful accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inhibiting the propagation of lipid peroxidation while antioxidants potentially neutralise beneficial oxidative species. Here. we developed a model system to mimic the human dietary requirement of omega-3 in C. elegans to study the role of deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFAs). Deuterated trilinolenin [D-TG(54:9)] was sufficient to prevent the accumulation of lipid peroxides and to reduce the accumulation or ROS. Moreover. D-TG(54:9) significantly extended the lifespan of worms under normal and oxidative stress conditions. These findings suggest that D-PUFAs can be used as a food supplement to decelerate the aging process. resulting in extended lifespan.,True,H-zySokAAAAJ:UHK10RUVsp4C,11,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00641/full,12073815751200583575,/scholar?cites=12073815751200583575,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00641/full,0,0,0

The research was conducted in a complete randomized design consisting of 5 replications. The nonenzymatic browning inhibition process was tested with ascorbic acid treatment as the main factor with five concentrations ie 0% w/v. 2.5% w/v. 5% w/v. 7.5% w/v and 10% w/v. Qualitative parameters were dehydrogenase enzyme activity and reducing sugar level. Quantitative parameters were browning index and total soluble carbohydrate content. Levene test. analysis of variance. and Tukey test were performed at 5% significant level. The results showed that pondoh snake fruit juice with treatment relatively lighter than pondoh snake fruit juice control. Decrease in dehydrogenase enzyme activity occurs along with increasing the concentration of ascorbic acid. The level of reducing sugar has increased along with the increase of ascorbic acid concentration. The 10% w/v ascorbic acid concentration decrease in non-enzymatic browning of pondoh snake fruit juice with a 27% reduction in the browning index. Total soluble carbohydrate content increased 15% at 7. 5% w/v ascorbic acid concentration.

Hence. knowledge on how xenobiotics affect these organisms is essential in ecosystem management. Cadmium (Cd) is an increasing environmental issue as both industrial deposition and recycling of heavy metal rich waste products have led to Cd enrichment of soils. Evaluation of toxicity of Cd to micro-organisms is often performed using a solution of pure Cd (e.g. CdCl) in liquid culture. This approach may be highly misleading as interactions between Cd and other substances. e.g. various ions or inherent soil components often strongly modify Cd toxicity.

Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is known to reduce Cd translocation in plants by immobilising Cd in the root system. The effect of mycorrhiza on plant Cd uptake is usually studied in simple systems with single strains of mycorrhizal fungi and few levels of Cd. Here we studied how a wide range of soil Cd concentrations affected plant AM colonisation. and how the species-specific differences in AM colonisation affected uptake. translocation. and toxicity of Cd in plants in a system with naturally occurring mycorrhizal fungi. Six plant species were grown in pots in a greenhouse across seven levels of Cd. which made it possible to model dose-response curves. and calculate EC50 for each plant species.

The seed microbiome (inside and surface microorganisms) is unknown for most plant species and seed-borne microorganisms can persist and transfer to the seedling and rhizosphere. thereby obscuring the effects that purposely introduced microorganisms have on plants. This necessitates that these unidentified. seed-borne microorganisms are removed before seeds are used for studies on plant–microbiome interactions. Unfortunately. there is no single. standardized protocol for seed sterilization. hampering progress in experimental plant growth promotion and our study shows that commonly applied sterilization protocols for barley grains using H 2 O 2. NaClO. and AgNO 3 yielded insufficient sterilization. We therefore developed a sterilization protocol with AgNO 3 by testing several concentrations of AgNO 3 and added two additional steps: Soaking the grains in water before the sterilization and rinsing with salt water (1%(w/w) NaCl) after the sterilization. The most efficient sterilization protocol was to soak the grains. sterilize with 10%(w/w) AgNO 3. and to rinse with salt water. By following those three steps. 97% of the grains had no culturable. viable microorganism after 21 days based on microscopic inspection. The protocol left small quantities of AgNO 3 residue on the grain. maintained germination percentage similar to unsterilized grains. and plant biomass was unaltered. Hence. our protocol using AgNO 3 can be used successfully for experiments on plant–microbiome interactions.,True,Y18cGZAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/3/372,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/9/3/372/pdf,0,0,0

Recycling of wood ash. which is a by-product from the combustion of wood biomass. to production forests secures a sustainable circular flow of nutrients. and have numerous beneficial effects on soil fertility. However. wood ash also contains considerable amounts of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd). which may cause problems to the soil ecosystem and ultimately. due to bio-accumulation. affect human health. The methods traditionally used for risk-assessments and threshold values may be out-dated and based on precautionary principles. These methods generally test the xenobiotic. here Cd. in a standardized growth conditions. Therefore. studies that focus on the specific target area; the soil. and the product; the ash. is needed. I studied different aspects of Cd toxicity and bio-accumulation in relation to wood ash recycling. The specific research areas were 1. Toxicity of Cd in soil; 2. Wood ash induced changes in the soil bio-availability of Cd; 3. Synergistic effect of Cd and Zn; 4. The effect of mycorrhiza on Cd accumulation; and 5. Bioaccumulation of Cd.I found that very large amounts of Cd is needed to affect soil-living organisms and processes. because sorption processes in the soil bind Cd in an insoluble form which leave only a small fraction available to the organisms. In addition. wood ash increase the sorption capacity of the soil and thus decrease Cd toxicity further to soil organisms. and may decrease plant accumulation of Cd.

The interphase vegetative cells display a well-organized F-actin cytoskeleton. consisting of cortical. endoplasmic and perinuclear arrays of actin filaments (AFs). The organization of these AFs changes slightly during mitosis. while they almost disappear at cytokinesis. The perinuclear AF population becomes more obvious during prophase. especially at the poles.

This consists of bundles of actin filaments (AFs). assuming definite patterns of organization in different regions of the cell cortex. At the tip region of the apical dome the AFs appear randomly oriented. showing a diffuse fluorescence. Immediately below. at the base of the apical hemisphere. the AFs form a ring-like band around the plasmalemma transverse to the polar cell axis. The rest of the cell cortex is traversed by AFs showing an axial or slightly inclined or helical orientation. Examination of the apical cells of S. rigidula in appropriate thin sections revealed that the wall has a multi-layered structure. In the tip region of the apical dome the cell wall bears randomly oriented cellulose microfibrils (MFs). while in the basal part of the apical dome it is reinforced by a layer of densely arranged transverse MFs.

IRI can lead to acute cell death. tissue injury and even permanent organ dysfunction. In the clinic. IRI contributes to a higher morbidity and mortality and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis in AKI patients. Unfortunately. effective clinical drugs to protect patients against the imminent risk of renal IRI or treat already existing AKI are still lacking. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are important regulators of key biological and pathological processes. such as embryonic development. metabolic homeostasis and tumorigenesis through the regulation of cell differentiation. migration. proliferation and survival. Accumulating evidence suggests that altered expression of endogenous FGFs is associated with IRI and could be instrumental in mediating the repair process. Therefore. FGFs have been proposed as potential biomarkers in the clinic. More importantly. exogenous FGF ligands have been reported to protect against renal IRI and display promising features for therapy. In this review. we summarize the evidence and mechanisms of AKI following IRI with a focus on the therapeutic capacity of several members of the FGF family to treat AKI after IRI.,True,RbrvI40AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,2,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00426/full,1437332383377432692,/scholar?cites=1437332383377432692,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00426/full,0,0,0

To assess zinc (Zn) and vitamin D (Vit. D) status in chronic Hepatitis C virus- (HCV) infected patients and their relationship to interleukin- (IL-) 17 and disease severity and then investigate whether Zn and Vit. D3 modulate IL-17 expression in chronic HCV patients. Methods. Seventy patients and fifty healthy subjects were investigated. Serum levels of Zn. Vit. D. and IL-17 were assessed in the patients group and subgroups. Patients lymphocytes were activated in vitro in the presence or absence of Zn or Vit. D3 and then intracellular IL-17 production was assessed using flow cytometry. Results. Zn and Vit. D were significantly decreased in HCV patients. Increasing disease severity leads to more reduction in Zn level opposed by increasing IL-17 level. Zn potently reduced IL-17 production in a dose-related fashion; however it did not exert any toxic effects. Although Vit. D apparently increases IL17 expression. it is unclear whether it is due to its toxic effect on cell count or lack of definite association between Vit. D and both IL-17 and disease severity.

Defensins are broadly dispersed family of antimicrobial peptides which are classified into 2 distinct families: the alpha-defensins and the beta-defensins. The primary function of defensins is to protect the skin from invasion by foreign pathogens. Previous studies suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the beta-defensin 1 gene (DEFB1) could be involved in the development of AD. The Aim of the study is to examine DEFB1 gene to gain a better understanding of their role in the pathophysiology of AD patients and their involvement in AD susceptibility and severity. 35 atopic patients and 10 healthy volunteers as controls were investigated. They were subjected to analysis of absolute eosinophil count. total and specific IgE and detection of Beta-defensin-1 gene polymorphism at position 692 and 1654 using PCR amplification and restriction analysis. We observed significant difference in the distribution of the DEFB1 AIG polymorphism at 692 (P< 0.01) in AD patients compared to controls. but not at 1654.

1064108,Peripheral blood mononuclear cells serve as a possible extrahepatic site for hepatitis C virus replication,2009,Manal Z Mahran and Afaf Abd Elalim and Amal Abbas,16,Egypt J Immunol,,63-70,,Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is thought to have a strong tropism for hepatic tissue but also replicative intermediates are found in extrahepatic tissues suggesting active viral replication in these cells. The aim of the study is to confirm that HCV can infect and replicate in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as one of the possible sites of extrahepatic hepatitis C virus replication during the natural course of infection which may serve as a source of virions causing reinfection. Reverse transcriptase Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of positive and negative strands of HCV-RNA in PBMCs was done for 30 patients with chronic HCV infection admitted to Ain Shams University Hospitals and the results were compared with those from 20 healthy controls matched in age and sex. Our results revealed statistically significant association between both HCV-RNA positive strand and negative strand and both serum HCV-RNA and HCV-Antibody (Ab)(P< 0.01). Moreover the association between the presence of HCV positive-and negative-strand RNA in PBMCs was statistically significant (P< 0.01). Finally the correlation between HCV positive and negative stranded RNA in PBMCs and extrahepatic complications was statistically significant (P< 0. 01). In conclusion our results support previous observations indicating that HCV can infect PBMCs. This is reflected by a higher frequency of extrahepatic complications and diseases associated with chronic HCV infection. epatitis C virus (HCV) is responsible for most cases of post-transfusion hepatitis (Alter & Seeff. 2000) with a chronic course in up to 60% of individuals. leading to cirrhosis and …,True,KJ6uVM4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,4,https://eai.org.eg/journal/pdf/vol-june2009/7-Amal%20Abass1.pdf,13298204678957245142,/scholar?cites=13298204678957245142,,https://eai.org.eg/journal/pdf/vol-june2009/7-Amal%20Abass1.pdf,0,0,0

We found that morphological and biochemical parameters of blood in cows depended on lactation period. We marked the highest level of hemoglobin content. red blood cells. content of glucose. total protein. albumins. αand β-globulins. albumin-globulin ratio. and the highest levels of aspartate aminotransferase activity and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) at the beginning of lactation period (2-3 month). that is period with pronounced milk yield. We also registered the differences in blood morphology and biochemistry in animals of different production types. Cows of the dairy-meat production type had the highest red blood cells number. hemoglobin content. total protein. albumins and coefficient of albumin-globulin ratio; the cows of dairy productive type had the highest globulins and αand γ-globulins content. whereas the cows of the meat-dairy production type had the highest β-globulins. glucose content. aspartate aminotransferase. and alkaline phosphatase activities. These specific intertypical traits in the morphological and biochemical blood composition indicate the higher intensity of oxidative and metabolic processes in the body of animals of combined production type.

We have tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing primary chicken erythroid progenitors through their differentiation process and measuring the expression of selected genes at six sequential time-points after induction of differentiation. In contrast to population-based expression data. single-cell gene expression data revealed a high cell-to-cell variability. which was masked by averaging. We were able to show that the correlation network was a very dynamical entity and that a subgroup of genes tend to follow the predictions from the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. In addition. we also identified a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved in sterol synthesis that could act as the initial drivers of the differentiation. In order to assess quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and its evolution in time. we used Shannon entropy as a measure of the heterogeneity. Entropy values showed a significant increase in the first 8 h of the differentiation process. reaching a peak between 8 and 24 h. before decreasing to significantly lower values. Moreover. we observed that the previous point of maximum entropy precedes two paramount key points: an irreversible commitment to differentiation between 24 and 48 h followed by a significant increase in cell size variability at 48 h. In conclusion. when analyzed at the single cell level. the differentiation process looks …,True,7Yg_S4oAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,129,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002585,7872533256262466026,/scholar?cites=7872533256262466026,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002585,0,0,0

Recently. single-cell transcriptomic data have been massively used for gene regulatory network inference. with both successes and limitations. In the present work we propose an iterative algorithm called WASABI. dedicated to inferring a causal dynamical network from time-stamped single-cell data. which tackles some of the limitations associated with current approaches. We first introduce the concept of waves. which posits that the information provided by an external stimulus will affect genes one-by-one through a cascade. like waves spreading through a network. This concept allows us to infer the network one gene at a time. after genes have been ordered regarding their time of regulation. We then demonstrate the ability of WASABI to correctly infer small networks. which have been simulated in silico using a mechanistic model consisting of coupled piecewise-deterministic Markov processes for the proper description of gene expression at the single-cell level. We finally apply WASABI on in vitro generated data on an avian model of erythroid differentiation. The structure of the resulting gene regulatory network sheds a new light on the molecular mechanisms controlling this process. In particular. we find no evidence for hub genes and a much more distributed network structure than expected. Interestingly. we find that a majority of genes are under the direct control of the differentiation-inducing stimulus. Together. these results demonstrate WASABI versatility and ability to tackle some general gene …,True,7Yg_S4oAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,11,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2798-1,1989987755370201347,/scholar?cites=1989987755370201347,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-2798-1,0,0,0

It has been suggested that stochastic gene expression has a role in cell fate decision-making which is revealed by single-cell analyses but studies dedicated to demonstrate the consistency of this link are still lacking. Recent observations showed that SGE significantly increased during differentiation and a few showed that an increase of the level of SGE is accompanied by an increase in the differentiation process. However. a consistent relation in both increasing and decreasing directions has never been shown in the same cellular system. Such demonstration would require to be able to experimentally manipulate simultaneously the level of SGE and cell differentiation in order to observe if cell behavior matches with the current theory. We identified three drugs that modulate SGE in primary erythroid progenitor cells. Both Artemisinin and Indomethacin decreased SGE and reduced the amount of differentiated cells. On the contrary. a third component called MB-3 simultaneously increased the level of SGE and the amount of differentiated cells. We then used a dynamical modelling approach which confirmed that differentiation rates were indeed affected by the drug treatment. Using single-cell analysis and modeling tools. we provide experimental evidence that. in a physiologically relevant cellular system. SGE is linked to differentiation.,True,7Yg_S4oAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,9,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225166,10998004514706338109,/scholar?cites=10998004514706338109,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225166,0,0,0

However. the in vitro erythropoiesis. which produces red blood cells in cultures. has received much less attention from the modelling community. In this paper. we propose the first mathematical model of in vitro erythropoiesis. We start by formulating different models and select the best one at fitting experimental data of in vitro erythropoietic differentiation obtained from chicken erythroid progenitor cells. It is based on a set of linear ODE. describing 3 hypothetical populations of cells at different stages of differentiation.

This major difference suggests that the erythroid differentiation process is likely to present both similarities and differences in mammals compared to other vertebrates. Since proteins are the major cellular effectors. analysis of the proteome is more prone to reflect true differences than analysis of the pattern of mRNA expression. We have previously reported the evolution of the proteome of human erythroid cells throughout their differentiation process. Here we report the analysis of the proteome of chicken erythroblasts during their terminal differentiation. We used the T2EC cellular model that allows to obtain homogenous populations of immature erythroblasts. Induction of their terminal differentiation led to their maturation and the possibility to obtain cells at different differentiation stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of these cell populations allowed the absolute quantification of 6167 proteins throughout the terminal differentiation process. Beside many proteins with similar expression patterns between chicken and human erythroblasts. like SLC4A1 (Band3). GATA1 or CD44. this analysis also revealed that other important proteins like Kit or other GATA transcription factors exhibit fully different patterns of expression.,True,7Yg_S4oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/289728v1.abstract,1991030331822792917,/scholar?cites=1991030331822792917,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/27/289728.full.pdf,0,0,0

Developmental biology. but also cell biology more generally. are examples where apparently robust behaviour emerges from highly complex and stochastic sub-cellular processes. Here we attempt to make connections between different theoretical perspectives to gain qualitative insights into the types of cell-fate decision making processes that are at the heart of stem cell and developmental biology. We discuss both dynamical systems as well as statistical mechanics perspectives on the classical Waddington or epigenetic landscape.

One of the numerous sources of cell-to-cell variation in gene expression is the heterogeneity in cell proliferation state. In order to identify how cell cycle and cell size influences gene expression variability at the single-cell level. we provide an universal and automatic toxic-free label method. compatible with single-cell high-throughput RT-qPCR. The method consists of isolating cells after a double-stained. analyzing their morphological parameters and performing a transcriptomic analysis on the same identified cells. This led to an unbiased gene expression analysis and could be also used for improving single-cell tracking and imaging when combined with cell isolation. As an application for this technique. we showed that cell-to-cell variability in chicken erythroid progenitors was negligibly influenced by cell size nor cell cycle.,True,7Yg_S4oAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-018-3195-y,14838789088193478047,/scholar?cites=14838789088193478047,,https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-018-3195-y,0,0,0

The intrinsic complexity. but also features such as molecular noise represent challenges for modelling these systems. Waddington9s epigenetic landscape has become the overriding metaphor for developmental processes: it both serves as pictorial representation. and can be related to mathematical models. In this work we investigate how the landscape is affected by noise in the underlying system.  Specifically. we focus on those systems where minor changes in the parameters cause major changes in the stability properties of the system. especially bifurcations. We analyse and quantify the changes in the landscape9s shape as the effects of noise increase. We find ample evidence for intricate interplay between noise and dynamics which can lead to qualitative change in a system9s dynamics and hence the corresponding landscape. In particular. we find that the effects can be most pronounced in the vicinity of the bifurcation point of the underlying deterministic dynamical systems. which would correspond to the cell fate decision event in cellular differentiation processes.,True,7Yg_S4oAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.03.425143v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/04/2021.01.03.425143.full.pdf,0,0,0

La forme de ce paysage est le résultat de l'état du réseau de régulation de gènes sous-jacent. Pour se différencier. les cellules doivent s'échapper de l'état d'auto-renouvellement pour transiter à travers la colline et atteindre l'état différencié.

1064167,Traceability of origin and authenticity of olive oil,2012,Zohreh Rabiei and Sattar Tahmasebi Enferadi,,,,,INTECH Open Access Publisher,Olive (Olea europaea L.) is one of the oldest agricultural tree crops worldwide and is an important source of oil with beneficial properties for human health. Olive oil is produced solely from the fruit of the olive tree (Olea europaea L.) and differs from most of the other vegetable oils in the method of extraction. allowing it to be consumed in crude form. hence conserving its vitamins and other natural healthy high-value compounds.In comparison to commonly used vegetable oils. the cost of olive oil is higher. As such. olive oil is more prone against adulteration with other cheaper oils in order to increase profits. Several grades of olive oil are marketed which also command different prices. There is also the possibility of the addition of cheaper grades of olive oil to better graded ones for the same economic reasons. The presence in highly prized olive oils of lower grade material is sometimes revealed by specific analytical methods.,True,fGMixTkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,23,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zohreh_Rabiei/publication/221923415_Traceability_of_Origin_and_Authenticity_of_Olive_Oil/links/02e7e52288f7fd56c7000000/Traceability-of-Origin-and-Authenticity-of-Olive-Oil.pdf,9509648877126858441,/scholar?cites=9509648877126858441,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zohreh_Rabiei/publication/221923415_Traceability_of_Origin_and_Authenticity_of_Olive_Oil/links/02e7e52288f7fd56c7000000/Traceability-of-Origin-and-Authenticity-of-Olive-Oil.pdf,0,0,0

C. HA 89. HA 410. HA 411. to inoculation with Sclerotinia sclerotiorum culture filtrate containing endogenous oxalic acid was compared with the exogenous application of synthetic oxalic acid. The reaction of seedlings was evaluated in terms of dry and fresh plant weights and the total chlorophyll concentration relative to untreated controls. The expression of shikimate dehydrogenase in cotyledons was also assessed five days after treatment. The results indicated that exogenous oxalic acid inoculation caused more deleterious effects on stem rot. eliciting photosynthesis reduction and different isoenzyme patterns of shikimate dehydrogenase. A positive correlation was found between increased oxalic acid and shikimate dehydrogenase activity in both treatments. However. the excessive toxicity of the exogenously administrated acid suggests that Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infection triggers a more complex metabolic pathway involving oxalic acid secreted by the pathogen. These observations preclude the possibility of using the synthetic acid administration as a method of screening sunflower genotypes for resistance to Sclerotinia. In addition to these findings. the reactivation of shikimate dehydrogenase was observed in both treatments.

The discovery of genes encoding biosynthetic pathway enzymes for defined plant specialized metabolites has been informed and accelerated by the detection of gene clusters. Unfortunately. biosynthetic pathway genes are commonly dispersed across chromosomes or reside in genes clusters that provide little predictive value. More reliably. transcript abundance of genes underlying biochemical pathways for plant specialized metabolites display significant coregulation. By rapidly identifying highly coexpressed transcripts. it is possible to efficiently narrow candidate genes encoding pathway enzymes and more easily predict both functions and functional associations. Mutual Rank (MR)-based coexpression analyses in plants accurately demonstrate functional associations for many specialized metabolic pathways; however. despite the clear predictive value of MR analyses. the application is uncommonly used to drive new pathway discoveries. Moreover. many coexpression databases aid in the prediction of both functional associations and gene functions. but lack customizability for refined hypothesis testing. To facilitate and speed flexible MR-based hypothesis testing. we developed MutRank. an R Shiny web-application for coexpression analyses.

However. empirical support for this is scarce. Moreover. this idea has recently been challenged by an alternative hypothesis: visual complexity of the background impedes prey detection. and hence prey could instead prefer complex parts of the habitat.

Previous experiments have found strong evidence for an intimidating effect of eyespots against passerine birds. Some eyespots have been suggested to increase prey survival by diverting attacks towards less vital body parts or a direction that would facilitate escape. While eyespots in aquatic environments are widespread. their function is extremely understudied. Therefore. we investigated the protective function of eyespots against attacking fish. We used artificial prey and predator-naive three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as predators to test both the diversion (deflection) and the intimidation hypothesis.

We test a counterintuitive hypothesis about the function of iridescence: that it can act as camouflage through interference with object recognition. Using an established insect visual model (Bombus terrestris). we demonstrate that both diffraction grating and multilayer iridescence impair shape recognition (although not the more subtle form of diffraction grating seen in some flowers). supporting the idea that both strategies can be effective means of camouflage. We conclude that iridescence produces visual signals that can confuse potential predators. and this might explain the high frequency of iridescence in many animal taxa.,True,2BidLdoAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,20,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26571-6,11082867925378179471,/scholar?cites=11082867925378179471,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26571-6,0,0,0

Two alternative hypotheses propose that (1) the eyelike appearance of the pattern falsely indicates the presence of the predator’s own enemy or (2) predators are hardwired to be cautious toward conspicuous prey. Earlier research has pertained mainly to eyespots in butterflies. Here we tested the hypothesis that eyespots resemble eyes by utilizing the lateral position of eyes in fishes.

1064233,Anti-predator adaptations in aquatic environments,2014,Karin Kjernsmo,,,,,Åbo Akademi-Åbo Akademi University,Predation is an important selective force that has led to the evolution of a variety of fascinating anti-predator adaptations. such as many types of protective coloration and prey behaviours. Because the evolution of life has begun in the aquatic environment and many anti-predator adaptations are found already in relative primitive taxa. it is likely that many of these adaptations evolved initially in the aquatic environment. Yet. there has been surprisingly little research on the mechanisms and function of antipredator adaptations in aquatic systems. To understand the function of anti-predator adaptations and natural selection imposed on prey appearance and behaviour. I have investigated how protective coloration can be used. either as such or together with behavioural adaptations. to manipulate predator behaviour and decrease predation risk. To this end I conducted a series of behaviour ecological laboratory experiments in which I manipulated the visual appearance of artificial backgrounds and prey items. In paper I of this thesis. I investigated background choice as an anti-predator strategy. by observing the habitat choice of the least killifish (Heterandria formosa) between pairs of artificial backgrounds. both in the presence and absence of predation threat. It has been suggested that prey could decrease their risk of being detected by predators either by preferring backgrounds into which they blend or by preferring visually complex backgrounds.

Although the mechanisms underlying PLK1 activation have been extensively studied. the regulatory mechanisms that couple PLK1 activity to accurate chromosome segregation are not well understood.

We have recently discovered that mitotic chromosomes sequentially acquire two interesting morphological patterns along their structural axes [L. Chu et al.. Mol. Cell. 10.1016/j.molcel.2020.07.002 (2020)]. First. axes of closely conjoined sister chromosomes acquire regular undulations comprising nearly planar arrays of sequential half-helices of similar size and alternating handedness. accompanied by periodic kinks. This pattern. which persists through all later stages. provides a case of the geometric form known as a “perversion.” Next. as sister chromosomes become distinct parallel units. their individual axes become linked by bridges. which are themselves miniature axes. These bridges are dramatically evenly spaced. Together. these effects comprise a unique instance of spatial patterning in a subcellular biological system.

Historically. allostery in structured proteins has been interpreted in terms of propagated structural changes that are induced by effector binding. Thus. it is not clear how IDPs. lacking such well-defined structures. can allosterically affect function. Here. we show a mechanism by which an IDP can allosterically control function by simultaneously tuning transcriptional activation and repression. using a novel strategy that relies on the principle of ‘energetic frustration’. We demonstrate that human glucocorticoid receptor tunes this signaling in vivo by producing translational isoforms differing only in the length of the disordered region. which modulates the degree of frustration. We expect this frustration-based model of allostery will prove to be generally important in explaining signaling in other IDPs.,True,8Jxci2AAAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C,46,https://elifesciences.org/articles/30688,11428746839810392771,/scholar?cites=11428746839810392771,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/30688.pdf,0,0,0

The critical swimming speed of white seabream larvae increased along ontogeny from 1.1 cm s− 1 (15 DPH) to 23 cm s− 1 (50 and 55 DPH). and the distance swam by larvae in the endurance experiments increased from 0.01 km (15 DPH) to 86.5 km (45 DPH). This finding supports one of the premises of the SAAB hypothesis. which proposes that fish larvae can influence their transport and distribution in coastal areas due to their swimming capabilities. The relationship between larvae’s physiological condition and swimming capabilities were not evident in this study. Overall. this study provides critical information for understanding the link between population dynamics and connectivity with the management and conservation of fish stocks.

Consequently. an important goal is the development of a vaccine that can provide rapid protection while overcoming the potential risk associated with the production of conventional inactivated vaccines. An important secondary feature of the vaccine would be the ability to distinguish vaccinated from infected animals. A recombinant fowlpox virus (vUTAL3CP1) containing FMDV capsid polypeptide and 3C coding regions of O/NY00 was constructed and evaluated for its ability to induce humoral and cellular responses in mice and guinea pigs. In addition. the ability to protect guinea pigs against homologous virus challenge was examined.

Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) functional feeding groups’ composition (FFG). This is because FFG from these three orders play a major role in leaf decomposition. A study of EPT FFG on leaf breakdown was carried out on two types of leaf packs. single leaf species (Pometia pinnata) and two leaf species (Pometia pinnata and Dolichandrone spathacea) in Tupah River. Kedah. Malaysia. In single species leaf pack. the collector-gatherers were most abundant but in two species leaf pack. the collector-filterers were more abundant. Shredders were well represented in the two species leaf pack while predator abundance was higher in the single species leaf pack. On the first 14 days of leaf immersion. the shredders were found to be the most highest in abundance. Meanwhile. high abundance of collector-filterers and collector-gatherers were observed at the later stage of decomposition (14-21 days) in both leaf types. However. higher predator populations were recorded on day 14 until day 28 corresponded to high availability of prey species (collectors) within the leaf packs.* Corresponding Author: Suhaila Ab Hamid✉ ahsuhaila@ usm. my,True,lv-g-b8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/51656354/Leaf_packs_ffg.pdf,14456884933309214032,/scholar?cites=14456884933309214032,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51656354/Leaf_packs_ffg.pdf,0,0,0

1064294,Stability of the human microbiome. Health and disease imprinted in the time variability of the human microbiota.,2019,Daniel Martínez Martínez,,,,,,Animal microbiota plays an essential role in keeping the physiological status of the host healthy. This microbiota consists of hundreds of different species that inhabit the host. and whose composition varies on a daily basis due to multiple factors as diets. medicine intakes. lifestyle or diseases. It is a highly dynamical system that shows variability even when the host is in a healthy condition. but visible changes happen when the system is perturbed. Thus. the main objective of this thesis aimed to study the temporal variability of human microbiota. and link it to the health status of the host. For this. we proposed a formal definition of stability in microbial systems based on the use of the Taylor#s law. an empirical law that captures the degree of variability of a community through time or space. With this tool in hand. we studied different scenarios in which the microbiome was perturbed. This law estimates the temporal variability of the microbial population and quantitatively characterises the path toward disease via a noise-induced phase transition.  As the estimation of these systemic parameters may be of clinical utility. we applied this methodology to two cases of follow-up studies.

The production of very large data sets. hundreds of thousands of peptides. has revealed unexpected properties of combinatorial random peptide libraries and indicates correctives to ensure the quality of the libraries generated. Next. Deep Panning is used to analyze a model monoclonal antibody in addition to allowing one to follow the dynamics of biopanning and peptide selection. Finally Deep Panning is applied to profile polyclonal sera derived from HIV infected individuals.   Conclusions/Significance The ability to generate and characterize hundreds of thousands of affinity-selected peptides creates an effective means towards the interrogation of the IgOme and understanding of the humoral response to disease …,True,VTWZ2MIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,50,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041469,11165171607811160919,/scholar?cites=11165171607811160919,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0041469,0,0,0

To overcome this problem we mutated the very immunogenic immunotoxin SS1P to produce LMB-T20. a de-immunized RIT that has the eight human T-cell epitopes in SS1P modified or removed. To determine the effect of T-cell epitope removal in vivo we mapped the T-cell epitopes in immune-competent BALB/c mice and found that these mice recognize two epitopes. One corresponds to the human immunodominant T-cell epitope and the other to a human subdominant epitope; both were eliminated in LMB-T20. We found that mice immunized with LMB-T20 did not have T-cell activation and did not develop anti-drug antibodies (ADA). whereas mice immunized with SS1P. showed T-cell activation. and developed ADA detected by both ELISA and drug neutralizing assays.

It is used to treat T cell leukemias and lymphomas. To make LMB-2 less immunogenic. we introduced a large deletion in domain II and six point mutations in domain III that were previously shown to reduce T cell activation in other RITs. We found that unlike other RITs. deletion of domain II from LMB-2 severely compromised its activity. Rather than deletion. we identified T cell epitopes in domain II and used alanine substitutions to identify point mutations that diminished those epitopes. The novel RIT. LMB-142 contains a 38 kDa toxin and nine point mutations that diminished T cell response to the corresponding peptides by an average of 75%.

1064298,Protection of the furin cleavage site in low-toxicity immunotoxins based on Pseudomonas exotoxin A,2016,Gilad Kaplan and Fred Lee and Masanori Onda and Emily Kolyvas and Gaurav Bhardwaj and David Baker and Ira Pastan,8,Toxins,8,217,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are fusions of an Fv-based targeting moiety and a toxin. Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) has been used to make several immunotoxins that have been evaluated in clinical trials. Immunogenicity of the bacterial toxin and off-target toxicity have limited the efficacy of these immunotoxins. To address these issues. we have previously made RITs in which the Fv is connected to domain III (PE24) by a furin cleavage site (FCS). thereby removing unneeded sequences of domain II. However. the PE24 containing RITs do not contain the naturally occurring disulfide bond around the furin cleavage sequence. because it was removed when domain II was deleted. This could potentially allow PE24 containing immunotoxins to be cleaved and inactivated before internalization by cell surface furin or other proteases in the blood stream or tumor microenvironment. Here. we describe five new RITs in which a disulfide bond is engineered to protect the FCS. The most active of these. SS1-Fab-DS3-PE24. shows a longer serum half-life than an RIT without the disulfide bond and has the same anti-tumor activity. despite being less cytotoxic in vitro. These results have significance for the production of de-immunized. low toxicity. PE24-based immunotoxins with a longer serum half-life.

This binding to CD4 reveals cryptic and highly conserved epitopes. the molecular nature of which is still not fully understood. The atomic structures of CD4 complexed with gp120 core molecules (a form of gp120 in which the V1. V2. and V3 loops and N and C termini have been truncated) have indicated that a hallmark feature of the CD4-bound conformation is the bridging sheet minidomain. Variations in the orientation of the bridging sheet hairpins have been revealed when CD4-liganded gp120 was compared to CD4-unliganded trimeric envelope structures. Hence. there appears to be a number of conformational transitions possible in HIV-1 monomeric gp120 that are affected by CD4 binding.

A typical example is the case of display of peptides longer than 6 amino acid residues on the major coat protein. protein VIII of the filamentous bacteriophages M13 and fd. A solution to this problem has been the use of “two-gene systems” generating chimeric phages that concomitantly express wild-type protein VIII along with recombinant protein VIII. Although the two-gene systems are much more permissive in regard to insert length and composition. some cases can still adversely affect phage assembly. Although these phages genotypically contain the desired DNA of the insert. they appear to be phenotypically wild type.

Although LMB-2 has shown high cytotoxicity toward Tac-expressing cancer cells in clinical trials. its efficacy was hampered by the formation of anti-drug antibodies against the immunogenic bacterial toxin and by dose-limiting off-target toxicity.

Immunotoxins against CD25+ cells containing a portion of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE38) show extremely high cytotoxic activity.

Removal of domain II confers two major advantages: i) the immunogenic sequences found in domain II are removed. generating a less immunogenic toxin; ii) the non-specific toxicity of domain II-truncated toxins is much lower. allowing much higher doses of immunotoxin to be given safely (7-10-fold higher safe dosage). However. removal of domain II. which does not affect or enhances the cytotoxic activity of immunotoxins targeting the B cell marker CD22 or the mesothelioma marker mesothelin. lowers the activity of anti-CD25 immunotoxins 30-fold.

It is evident that Buddhist and Sino-Indian influences helped shape the traditional pharmacopoeia and methods in disease treatments. Well-documented medicinal practices started as early as the 14th century. during the time of the state of Lane Xang. Since then. medical traditions have been passed down orally through the centuries among different ethnic groups. as well as by way of written documents. including mulberry paper books and palm leaf manuscripts. Today. undeveloped forest covers more than forty per cent of the country. and at least seventy percent of the population lives in rural areas as subsistence farmers (IUCN. 2001). As a result. in the event of health problems. one easily turns to inexpensive local traditional herbal remedies for treatment.Laos' rich biodiversity provides a wealth of herbal medicines to the rural population. To illustrate. Laos holds four Global 200 Eco-regions. These regions are examples of the richest. rarest. and most distinct of the Earth's diverse natural habitats. critical for biodiversity conservation and global sustainability (Olson and Dinerstein. 1998). Because it is home to some of the most abundant and intact ecosystems on the Indochina Peninsula. in 1993 the government of Laos designated a National Protected Area (NPA) network to conserve the key habitats and diverse ecosystems to help protect this important and beautiful area. It may be noted that at that time. the act of setting aside the protected natural areas was very progressive in the Indo-Malayan Realm …,True,Mu7NF1UAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bethany_Elkington/publication/263777975_Assessment_of_the_importance_of_medicinal_plants_among_communities_around_Khiat_Ngong_of_Southern_Laos/links/56f7f6f508ae81582bf397ad.pdf,5027779567481535172,/scholar?cites=5027779567481535172,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bethany_Elkington/publication/263777975_Assessment_of_the_importance_of_medicinal_plants_among_communities_around_Khiat_Ngong_of_Southern_Laos/links/56f7f6f508ae81582bf397ad.pdf,0,0,0

Today. traditional herbal remedies are still frequently used throughout the country. In effort to preserve the indigenous knowledge held by healers and the information contained in the sacred manuscripts. an attempt was made to translate some of the traditional healing practices into biomedical terms. To accomplish this. medical manuscripts were investigated for symptoms of tuberculosis. a problem that has been afflicting Southeast Asia for thousands of years.

Defects in the ABCB4 gene are associated with rare biliary diseases. It is essential to understand the mechanisms of its canalicular membrane expression in particular for the development of new therapies. The stability of several ABC transporters is regulated through their binding to PDZ (PSD95/DglA/ZO-1) domain-containing proteins. ABCB4 protein ends by the sequence glutamine-asparagine-leucine (QNL). which shows some similarity to PDZ-binding motifs. The aim of our study was to assess the potential role of the QNL motif on the surface expression of ABCB4 and to determine if PDZ domain-containing proteins are involved. We found that truncation of the QNL motif decreased the stability of ABCB4 in HepG2-transfected cells. The deleted mutant ABCB4-ΔQNL also displayed accelerated endocytosis. EBP50. a PDZ protein highly expressed in the liver. strongly colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with ABCB4. and this interaction required the QNL motif. Down-regulation of EBP50 by siRNA or by expression of an EBP50 dominant-negative mutant caused a significant decrease in the level of ABCB4 protein expression. and in the amount of ABCB4 localized at the canalicular membrane. Interaction of ABCB4 with EBP50 through its PDZ-like motif plays a critical role in the regulation of ABCB4 expression and stability at the canalicular plasma membrane.,True,It46P8EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146962,12912991890746914015,/scholar?cites=12912991890746914015,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146962,0,0,0

In this paper. we describe a novel approach for the degradation of starch using the catalytic behaviour of AgNPs in an enzyme catalysed reaction of starch hydrolysis by α-amylase. AgNPs were synthesized by soluble starch reducing silver nitrate to silver atoms. An increase of 4.7-fold in reducing sugar formation and 1.5 times faster enzyme activity confirmed the catalytic activity of AgNPs as a nanocatalyst. Surprisingly. starch degradation tests revealed that 9.9 mg of starch was hydrolysed within 5 min. which corroborates with the reducing sugar assay. In short. the present study paves way for the faster degradation of starch by immobilizing the enzyme onto the surface of the AgNP. which could be a promising application in the food industry.,True,S5eIIw0AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621512000729,15599362471368821047,/scholar?cites=15599362471368821047,,,0,0,0

This is because its recalcitrant seeds are ill suited for long-term storage. Incorrectly labelled accessions have always been a problem in these collections. and until recently. the tools have not been available to clearly identify mislabelled clones. However. the emergence of reliable genetic fingerprinting techniques has enabled great strides to be made in the molecular characterisation of cocoa germplasm held in ex situ collections. Incorrectly labelled accessions can be broadly divided into the following three categories: a) synonymous designation. where the same genotype carries different names; b) homonymous designation. where different genotypes carry the same name; and c) non-designation. where accessions lack any name. Cocoa is not unique in having a significant mislabelling problem in ex situ collections. Indeed. mislabelled clones have been identified in collections of a variety of tree species including Eucalyptus (Keil and Griffin. 1994). Sitka spruce (Wilhelmina et al.. 1995) and oil palm (Purba et al.. 2000). and even in crop genebanks such as potato (Huamán et al.. 2000) and enset (Negash et al.. 2002).Preliminary work performed on material held in the International Cocoa Genebank collection in Trinidad (ICG. T) using RAPD analysis suggested that up to 30% of trees might be mislabelled (Christopher et al.. 1999).

1064343,High throughput. high resolution selection of polymorphic microsatellite loci for multiplex analysis,2005,Nicholas C Cryer and David R Butler and Mike J Wilkinson,1,Plant Methods,1,1-5,BioMed Central,Large-scale genetic profiling. mapping and genetic association studies require access to a series of well-characterised and polymorphic microsatellite markers with distinct and broad allele ranges. Selection of complementary microsatellite markers with non-overlapping allele ranges has historically proved to be a bottleneck in the development of multiplex microsatellite assays. The characterisation process for each microsatellite locus can be laborious and costly given the need for numerous. locus-specific fluorescent primers. Here. we describe a simple and inexpensive approach to select useful microsatellite markers. The system is based on the pooling of multiple unlabelled PCR amplicons and their subsequent ligation into a standard cloning vector. A second round of amplification utilising generic labelled primers targeting the vector and unlabelled locus-specific primers targeting the microsatellite flanking region yield allelic profiles that are representative of all individuals contained within the pool. Suitability of various DNA pool sizes was then tested for this purpose. DNA template pools containing between 8 and 96 individuals were assessed for the determination of allele ranges of individual microsatellite markers across a broad population. This helped resolve the balance between using pools that are large enough to allow the detection of many alleles against the risk of including too many individuals in a pool such that rare alleles are over-diluted and so do not appear in the pooled microsatellite profile. Pools of DNA from 12 individuals allowed the reliable detection of all alleles present in the pool.

Decreasing cacao genetic diversity (in situ. on-farm and conserved in collections) is a serious problem and all its many causes need to be urgently addressed: the destruction of the Amazonian rainforests. changing patterns of land use. the spread of pests and diseases. sudden changes in climate. and threats from natural disasters and extreme weather. These factors are resulting in an irreversible loss of the cacao genetic diversity so essential for farmers. breeders. and consumers. Most of the countries involved in the improvement and production of cacao are highly dependent on genes and varieties characterized and conserved in other countries and regions. Effective management of cacao genetic resources can therefore only be carried out through international collaboration. A considerable portion of the global cacao diversity is in situ. in farmers' fields and held in genebanks around the world. including two international collections maintained at the Cocoa Research Centre of the University of the West Indies (CRC/UWI). Trinidad and Tobago. and at the Centro Agronómico Tropical de Investigación y Enseñanza (CATIE). Costa Rica.

However. farm level yields are often very low. and sustainable intensification is urgently required. Assessing the impact of on-farm interventions of farm productivity and profitability requires an understanding of the contribution of inter-annual climate variability to cocoa yields.

Data were collected from six locations. these being: Brazil. Ecuador. Trinidad. Venezuela. Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. Canopy shape varied significantly between clones. although it showed little variation between locations. Genotypic variation in leaf size was differentially affected by the growth location; such differences appeared to underlie a genotype by environment interaction in relation to canopy light transmission. Flushing data were recorded at monthly intervals over the course of a year. Within each location. a significant interaction was observed between genotype and time of year. suggesting that some genotypes respond to a greater extent than others to environmental stimuli. A similar interaction was observed for flowering data. where significant correlations were found between flowering intensity and temperature in Brazil and flowering intensity and rainfall in Côte d’Ivoire.

CO2 and humidity. and the environmental signal has been shown to elicit both systemic and heritable responses. Plants. nevertheless. maintain plasticity in their capacity to moderate stomatal density during subsequent leaf growth. We hypothesized that the plastic element of stomatal formation could be under epigenetic control. In this way. gene expression patterns could be faithfully copied cell-to-cell and inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion. Plant flowering response to extremes of temperature is known to be epigenetically controlled in Arabidopsis and cytosine DNA methylation is an important mechanism epigenetically silencing genomic elements and regulating gene expression. We induced a reduced stomatal index in Arabidopsis by controlling percentage relative humidity (RH) and investigated methylation of known genes in stomatal formation and patterning pathways. using methylation-specific qPCR and high resolution melt analysis following bisulphite treatment. Two target genes involved in stomatal formation pathways were differentially methylated between treatments. Furthermore. stomatal density in the following. seminal generation of plants exposed to both RH percentages varied according to parental treatment.

Despite intensive efforts. most nuclear receptors have no known ligand. suggesting new ligand classes remain to be discovered. Furthermore. nuclear receptors are encoded in the genomes of primitive organisms that lack endocrine signaling. suggesting the primordial function may have been environmental sensing. Here we describe a novel Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear receptor. HIZR-1. that is a high zinc sensor in an animal and the master regulator of high zinc homeostasis. The essential micronutrient zinc acts as a HIZR-1 ligand. and activated HIZR-1 increases transcription of genes that promote zinc efflux and storage.

In C. elegans early embryos. PCN-1 accumulation is cyclic. localizing to the nucleus during S-phase and the cytoplasm during the rest of the cell cycle. The C. elegans larval and adult germline is an important model systems for studying cell cycle regulation. and it was observed that the cell cycle regulator cyclin E (CYE-1 in C. elegans) displays a non-cyclic. continuous accumulation pattern in this tissue. The accumulation pattern of PCN-1 has not been well defined in the larval and adult germline. and the objective of this study was to determine if the accumulation pattern is cyclic. as in other cells and organisms. or continuous. similar to cyclin E. To study the larval and adult germline accumulation of PCN-1 expressed from its native locus. we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer a novel allele of pcn-1 that encodes an epitope-tagged protein. S-phase nuclei were labeled using EdU nucleotide incorporation. and FLAG::PCN-1 was detected by antibody staining. All progenitor zone nuclei. including those that were not in S-phase (as they were negative for EdU staining) showed PCN-1 accumulation. indicating that PCN-1 accumulated during all cell cycle phases in the germline progenitor zone. The same result was observed with a GFP::PCN-1 fusion protein expressed from a transgene. pcn-1 loss-of-function mutations were analyzed. and pcn-1 was necessary for robust fertility and embryonic development.

We suggest that this striking behavior is linked to a gyroscopic instability in which the drop tries to keep constant its angular momentum while sliding along the jump.,True,E8Km0U4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,14,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.084503,395630027754532659,/scholar?cites=395630027754532659,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02377540/file/gyroscopic_pirat3.pdf,0,0,0

A biophysical model for cell wall mechanosensing in plants,2019,Antoine Fruleux and Stéphane Verger and Arezki Boudaoud,10,Frontiers in plant science,,757,Frontiers,Mechanical signals have recently emerged as a major cue in plant morphogenesis. notably influencing cytoskeleton organisation. gene expression. protein polarity. or cell division. Although many putative mechanosensing proteins have been identified. it is unclear what mechanical cue they might sense and how this would occur. Here we briefly explain the notions of mechanical stress and strain. We present the challenges to understand their sensing by plants. focusing on the cell wall and the plasma membrane. and we review putative mechanosensing structures. We propose minimal biophysical models of mechanosensing. revealing the modes of mechanosensing according to mechanosensor lifetime. threshold force for mechanosensor dissociation. and type of association between the mechanosensor and the cell wall. as the sensor may be associated to a major load-bearing structure such as cellulose or to a minor load-bearing structure such as pectins or the plasma membrane. Permanent strain. permanent expansion. and relatively slow variations thereof are sensed in all cases; variations of stress are sensed in all cases; permanent stress is sensed only in the following specific cases: sensors associated to minor load-bearing structures slowly relaxing in a growing wall. long-lived sensors with high dissociation force and associated to major-load-bearing structures. and sensors with low dissociation force associated to major-load-baring structures behaving elastically. We also find that all sensors respond to variations in the composition or the mechanical properties of the cell wall. The level of sensing is modulated by the properties of all of …,True,E8Km0U4AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,9,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00757/full,8007658203576492388,/scholar?cites=8007658203576492388,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2019.00757/full,0,0,0

Here. we investigate whether tissue responses to mechanical signals contribute to resolve this apparent paradox. We built a model of growing tissues made of fiber-like material. corresponding to the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix of animals. or to the cell wall of plants. taking into account the synthesis and remodeling of this fiber-like material. as well as the modulation of synthesis by isotropic and anisotropic response to mechanical stress.

We show that mechanical responses buffer localized perturbations. with two possible regimes - overdamped relaxation and underdamped relaxation. and the transition between the two corresponds to a minimum value of the relaxation time. Whereas robustness of shapes suggests that growth fluctuations are confined to small scales. our model yields growth fluctuations that have long-range correlations. This indicates that growth fluctuations are a source of heterogeneity in development. Nevertheless. we find that mechanical responses may dampen such fluctuations. with a magnitude of anisotropic response that minimizes heterogeneity of tissue contours.

We demonstrate the ability to robustly estimate historical fish community composition and assess the current status of the urbanized Barton Creek watershed in central Texas. U.S.A. Fish species were surveyed in 2008 and the resulting data compared to three sources of fish occurrence information: (i) historical records from a museum specimen database and literature searches; (ii) a nearly identical survey conducted 15 years earlier; and (iii) a modeled historical community constructed with species distribution models (SDMs). This holistic approach. and especially the application of SDMs. allowed us to discover that the fish community in Barton Creek was more diverse than the historical data and survey methods alone indicated. Sixteen native species with high modeled probability of occurrence within the watershed were not found in the 2008 survey. seven of these were not found in either survey or in any of the historical collection records. Our approach allowed us to more rigorously establish the true baseline for the pre-development fish fauna and then to more accurately assess trends and develop hypotheses regarding factors driving current fish community composition to better inform management decisions and future restoration efforts. Smaller. urbanized freshwater systems. like Barton Creek. typically have a relatively poor historical biodiversity inventory coupled with long histories of alteration. and thus there is a propensity for land managers and researchers to apply inaccurate baseline standards.

It was demonstrated that PKM2 interacts with tyrosine phosphopeptide. and the interaction with the tyrosine phosphopeptide affects the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2. Our experiments suggest that PKM2 is also an active protein kinase (Gao. X.. Wang. H.. Yang. J. J.. Liu. X.. and Liu. Z. R. (2012) Mol. Cell 45. 598–609). We report here that growth signals reciprocally regulate the pyruvate kinase and protein kinase activities of PKM2 by different mechanisms. On the one hand. growth signals induce protein tyrosine phosphorylations.

However. it is not known how PKM2 is released in the blood. and whether the circulating PKM2 has any physiological function(s) in tumor progression. In this report. we demonstrate that PKM2 in the blood facilitates tumor growth by promoting tumor angiogenesis.

This gene plays important roles in controlling fetal growth rates and nurturing behaviors. In the current study. a new mutant mouse model has been generated to further characterize the functions of this DNA-binding protein. Besides known phenotypes. this new mutant model also revealed potential roles of Peg3 in mammalian reproduction. Female heterozygotes produce a much smaller number of mature oocytes than the wild-type littermates. resulting in reduced litter sizes. According to genome-wide expression analyses. several placenta-specific gene families are de-repressed in the brain of Peg3 heterozygous embryos. including prolactin. cathepsin and carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (Ceacam) families. The observed de-repression is more pronounced in females than in males. The de-repression of several members of these gene families is observed even in the adult brain. suggesting potential defects in epigenetic setting of the placenta-specific gene families in the Peg3 mutants. Overall. these results indicate that Peg3 likely controls the transcription of several placenta-specific gene families. and further suggest that this predicted transcriptional control by Peg3 might be mediated through unknown epigenetic mechanisms.,True,dytQ-iEAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,58,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083359,5906684258264823733,/scholar?cites=5906684258264823733,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083359,0,0,0

In the current study. this prediction was tested using a mutant mouse line lacking this potential imprinting control region (ICR). At the organismal level. paternal and maternal transmission of this knockout (KO) allele caused either reduced or increased growth rates in the mouse. respectively. In terms of the imprinting control. the paternal transmission of the KO allele resulted in bi-allelic expression of the normally maternally expressed Zim2. whereas the maternal transmission switched the transcriptionally dominant allele for Zfp264 (paternal to maternal).

As such. many imprinted genes are highly expressed in sex-specific reproductive organs. In the current study. we sought to test whether imprinted genes are differentially expressed between the two sexes. According to the results. the expression levels of the following genes differ between the two sexes of mice: Peg3. Zim1. Igf2. H19 and Zac1.

At the time of introduction foreign genes do not fit well into the translation system of the recipient host bacterium as they tend to retain the characteristics of the donor bacterium from which they have been transferred. Consequently foreign genes are poorly transcribed at the early phase of their evolution within the host bacterium. This is largely due to the difference in the codon usage pattern between the horizontally transferred genes and the host bacterium.

Results TGF-β induced the expression of miRNA-181a. which in turn down-regulated ALR thereby induced the fibrosis markers. such as COLL1A1. α-SMA and rac1 in hepatic stellate cells. Over-expression of miRNA-181a down-regulated expression of ALR and up-regulated expression of fibrosis markers. On the other hand.

Mn and Fe in the soft tissue of bivalves Paphia undulata and Gafrarium pectinatum from Lake Timsah. Suez Canal. were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer technique. P. undulata showed apparent seasonal variations of metals accumulation with maximum concentrations during spring-summer months. Estimation of concentrations factor (CF) for the studied metals recorded high accumulation rates of Mn and Fe. Two-way ANOVA was conducted to evaluate the effect of inter-species and inter-size on the variability of bivalve heavy metal concentrations. ANOVA data demonstrated significant variations for the most studied metals. Correlation coefficient were calculated to study the length-metal and interelemental relationships. Length-metal relationships stated that Co. Cr and Mn in P. undulata and Cu. Zn. Ni and Co in G. pectinatum were independent of size. while the other metals gave significant negative correlation (at p< 0.05) with shell-length.

Because hyperactivated DDC signalling can lead to a persistent and detrimental cell-cycle arrest 2. 3. cells must tightly regulate the activity of the kinases involved in this pathway. Despite their importance. the mechanisms for monitoring and modulating DDC signalling are not fully understood.

In yeast and mammals. the scaffold protein TOPBP1Dpb11 has been implicated in HR. although its precise function and mechanism of action remain elusive. In this study. we show that yeast Dpb11 plays an antagonistic role in recombination control through regulated protein interactions. Dpb11 mediates opposing roles in DNA end resection by coordinating both the stabilization and exclusion of Rad9 from DNA lesions. The Mec1 kinase promotes the pro-resection function of Dpb11 by mediating its interaction with the Slx4 scaffold. Human TOPBP1Dpb11 engages in interactions with the anti-resection factor 53BP1 and the pro-resection factor BRCA1. suggesting that TOPBP1 also mediates opposing functions in HR control.

Here. we find that long-term chronic inhibition of ATR signaling severely impairs the ability of cells to utilize homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair. Proteomic analysis shows that chronic ATR inhibition depletes the abundance of key HR factors. suggesting that spontaneous ATR signaling enhances the capacity of cells to use HR-mediated repair by controlling the abundance of the HR machinery. Notably. ATR controls the abundance of HR factors largely via CHK1-dependent transcription. and can also promote stabilization of specific HR proteins.

1064471,Studies on some mite species infesting some fruit trees,2001,AS El-Halawany,,,,,,In Egypt. Productivity of fig and pear. fruit trees was disserved to be decreased both in quality and yield. during last few years. in spite of that fig trees area was greatly increased from 43285 to 55280 feddan in 1995 and 1999 years. respectively. However. area occupied by pear tree was gradually decreased from 13521 to 9925 feddan in 1995 and 1999. respectively. The total yield of both fig and pear fruit trees was 236915 and 54272 tons (5.47 and 4.01 ton per feddan) in 1995. while the analogous yield was 203005 and 38336 tons (3.67 and 3.85 ton/feddan) in 1999. respectively. The final goal of the agriculture policy is. generally aiming to increase production. the deciduous fruit trees by either horizontal or vertical extension. The vertical policy is generally concerned with the production and acclaiming some varieties of high yield (Quality and Quantity) and rather to extent the tolerance to the phytophagous pests. Large assemblages of mite species are generally seen inhabiting fig and pear trees. Among phytophagous mites. some species were usually seen causing moderate to sever damages to plants that may attract. result in low yield together with low quality of fruits. In some cases. mites may cause complete deterioration to the fruit trees.

1064484,Evaluating the necessity of PCR duplicate removal from next-generation sequencing data and a comparison of approaches,2016,Mark TW Ebbert and Mark E Wadsworth and Lyndsay A Staley and Kaitlyn L Hoyt and Brandon Pickett and Justin Miller and John Duce and John SK Kauwe and Perry G Ridge,17,BMC bioinformatics,7,491-500,BioMed Central,Analyzing next-generation sequencing data is difficult because datasets are large. second generation sequencing platforms have high error rates. and because each position in the target genome (exome. transcriptome. etc.) is sequenced multiple times. Given these challenges. numerous bioinformatic algorithms have been developed to analyze these data. These algorithms aim to find an appropriate balance between data loss. errors. analysis time. and memory footprint. Typical analysis pipelines require multiple steps. If one or more of these steps is unnecessary. it would significantly decrease compute time and data manipulation to remove the step. One step in many pipelines is PCR duplicate removal. where PCR duplicates arise from multiple PCR products from the same template molecule binding on the flowcell. These are often removed because there is concern they can lead to false positive variant calls. Picard (MarkDuplicates) and SAMTools (rmdup) are the two main softwares used for PCR duplicate removal. Approximately 92 % of the 17+ million variants called were called whether we removed duplicates with Picard or SAMTools. or left the PCR duplicates in the dataset. There were no significant differences between the unique variant sets when comparing the transition/transversion ratios (p = 1.0). percentage of novel variants (p = 0.99). average population frequencies (p = 0.99). and the percentage of protein-changing variants (p = 1.0).

The PhoR histidine kinase is responsible for phosphorylating/dephosphorylating the response regulator. PhoB. which controls the expression of genes that aid growth in low phosphate conditions. The mechanism by which PhoR receives a signal of environmental phosphate levels has remained elusive. A transporter complex composed of the PstS. PstC. PstA. and PstB proteins as well as a negative regulator. PhoU. have been implicated in signaling environmental phosphate to PhoR. This work confirms that PhoU and the PstSCAB complex are necessary for proper signaling of high environmental phosphate. Also. we identify residues important in PhoU/PhoR interaction with genetic analysis. Using protein modeling and docking methods. we show an interaction model that points to a potential mechanism for PhoU mediated signaling to PhoR to modify its activity. This model is tested with direct coupling analysis. These bioinformatics tools. in combination with genetic and biochemical analysis. help to identify and test a model for phosphate signaling and may be applicable to several other systems.,True,6qbqlj0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,17,https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2156-16-S2-S2,6173340535547618512,/scholar?cites=6173340535547618512,,https://bmcgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2156-16-S2-S2,0,0,0

These proteins are purposely built for replication in the organelle environment and are distinct from those involved in replication of the nuclear genome. These organelle-localized proteins have ancestral roots in bacterial and bacteriophage genes. supporting the endosymbiotic theory of their origin. We examined the interactions between three of these proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana: a DNA helicase-primase similar to bacteriophage T7 gp4 protein and animal mitochondrial Twinkle. and two DNA polymerases. Pol1A and Pol1B. We used a three-pronged approach to analyze the interactions. including Yeast-two-hybrid analysis. Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA). and thermophoresis. Yeast-two-hybrid analysis reveals residues 120–295 of Twinkle as the minimal region that can still interact with Pol1A or Pol1B. This region is a part of the primase domain of the protein and slightly overlaps the zinc-finger and RNA polymerase subdomains located within. Additionally. we observed that Arabidopsis Twinkle interacts much more strongly with Pol1A versus Pol1B. Thermophoresis also confirms that the primase domain of Twinkle has higher binding affinity than any other region of the protein. Direct-Coupling-Analysis identified specific residues in Twinkle and the DNA polymerases critical to positive interaction between the two proteins.

In contrast. alignment-free phylogenomic approaches typically use structure and oligomer frequencies to calculate pairwise distances between species. We have developed an approach to quickly calculate distances between species based on codon aversion.Utilizing a novel alignment-free character state. we present CAM. an alignment-free approach to recover phylogenies by comparing differences in codon aversion motifs (i.e.. the set of unused codons within each gene) across all genes within a species. Synonymous codon usage is non-random and differs between organisms. between genes. and even within a single gene. and many genes do not use all possible codons. We report a comprehensive analysis of codon aversion within 229.742.339 genes from 23.428 species across all kingdoms of life. and we provide an alignment-free framework for its use in a phylogenetic construct.

Ltd.,Human ESCs (HESCs) are self‐renewing pluripotent cell lines that are derived from the inner cell mass of blastocyst‐stage embryos. These cells can produce terminally differentiated cells representing the three embryonic germ layers. We thus hypothesized that during the course of in vitro differentiation of HESCs. progenitor‐like cells are transiently formed. We demonstrated that LEFTY proteins. which are known to play a major role during mouse gastrulation. are transiently expressed during HESC differentiation. Moreover. LEFTY proteins seemed to be exclusively expressed by a certain population of cells in the early human embryoid bodies that does not overlap with the population expressing the ESC marker OCT4.

1064507,Mesodermal Differentiation,2007,Nadav Sharon and Nissim Benvenisty,,,,129-148,Springer. Dordrecht,Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are self-renewing cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of human embryos (Thomson et al. 1998). Since the ICM gives rise to all the cells designated to proliferate and evolve into the complete embryo. it is believed that hESCs are pluripotent. capable of differentiating to all the human tissues (Schuldiner et al. 2000). During in vitro differentiation of hESCs. the cells may recapitulate in utero embryogenesis to some extent (Dvash et al. 2004). One of the first and foremost stages of this natural process is the formation of the three embryonic germ layers during gastrulation. Cells migrating through the primitive streak form the intra-embryonal layers of mesoderm and endoderm. whereas the remainder outside layer becomes ectoderm. This division dictates the formation of the major body axes. and the first acquirement of specificity by the cells forming the embryo.

It is not clear whether intratumoral Treg cells represent Treg cells pre-existing in healthy mice. or arise from tumor-specific effector CD4+ T cells and thus representing adaptive Treg cells. The generation of Treg population in tumors could be further complicated by recent evidence showing that both in humans and mice the peripheral population of Treg cells is heterogenous and consists of subsets which may differentially respond to tumor-derived antigens. We have studied Treg cells in cancer in experimental mice that express naturally selected. polyclonal repertoire of CD4+ T cells and which preserve the heterogeneity of the Treg population. The majority of Treg cells present in healthy mice maintained a stable suppressor phenotype. expressed high level of Foxp3 and an exclusive set of TCRs not used by naive CD4+ T cells. A small Treg subset. utilized TCRs shared with effector T cells and expressed a lower level of Foxp3. We show that response to tumor-derived antigens induced efficient clonal recruitment and expansion of antigen-specific effector and Treg cells. However. the population of Treg cells in tumors was dominated by cells expressing TCRs shared with effector CD4+ T cells. In contrast. Treg cells expressing an exclusive set of TCRs. that dominate in healthy mice. accounted for only a small fraction of all Treg cells in tumor lesions. Our results suggest that the Treg repertoire in tumors is generated by conversion of effector CD4+ T cells or expansion of a minor subset of Treg cells.

1064528,Selecting alternatives in place of naturally grown timber species-Local timbers for future?,2012,Hiran S Amarasekera,,,,,,Traditionally construction and wooden products sector select naturally grown timber for most of their timber requirements.  These include high rated rare hardwood timber species such as mee. satin. wewarana. milla. palu. halmilla. hulanhik. etathimbiri. dun. alubo. liyan and suriyamara.  These species are mostly grown in natural forests and their supplies have now become very limited.  Hence timber industry has to rely on alternative timber species that originate from sources other than natural forests. Properties that are essential for the introduction of plantation and home gardens species to the market are discussed in this paper.   Based on density and strength properties. Eucalyptus grandis. E. microcorys. ginisapu. teak. mahogany and jak are potential construction timbers for the future. Teak is an excellent durable timber however it is very expensive.  Mahogany is a good timber for door and window frames and sashes but sapwood of this species is susceptible for powder-post beetle and termite attack.  Jak is a durable traditional species but felling and usage of this species has been controlled.  Eucalyptus is also a durable timber that can be used in construction. Out of two Eucalyptus species E. microcorys is a better timber in terms of its higher density and resistance to splitting compared with E. grandis.   Wooden products sector includes furniture and export oriented wooden products such as toys and wooden components. Albizia. alstonia. lunumidella. pine. rubber and mahogany are some of the potential timbers that can be used in manufacturing these products.

Sri Lanka,2015,HTS Caldera and HS Amarasekera,5,Journal of Tropical Forestry and Environment,1,2015,University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Department of Forestry and Environmental Science,The demand for sawn timber and wood-based products is rising steadily with new developments and the growing domestic consumption in Sri Lanka. Therefore. it is important to strike a balance between the increasing demand and consumption of forest resources. Thus. the key objective of this study was to investigate the effects of sawmill management and technological parameters on loss in conversion from logs to sawn timber and to compare the sawmill efficiency in private sawmills with the state timber corporation sawmill.Sawmill management and technological parameters were studied in 21 private sawmills and State Timber Corporation sawmill in Kaldemulla to evaluate the effects on loss in conversion. The selected sawmills represent all types available in Sri Lanka. ie. frame saw. circular saw and band saw mills. Based on the results. mean percentage loss in conversion of teak and mahogany timber for all sawmills (private and State Timber Corporation) in Moratuwa found to be 53.10%. Significant differences were observed in loss in conversion values between the three categories of private sawmills as well as within sawmills of the same category. It was shown that loss in conversion values also varied with sawmill management and technological parameters such as type of machinery employed. sharpening frequency and sawyer’s experience. saw setting. availability of log alignment equipment and saw guards. oversizing and sawn timber sizes.,True,_Jm6E2MAAAAJ:fPk4N6BV_jEC,2,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228530607.pdf,11295216288308066157,/scholar?cites=11295216288308066157,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228530607.pdf,0,0,0

In this study. a yeast two-hybrid screening of human mammary cDNA library identified human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (hUbc9) that interacted with SOX4. This interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down in vitro and co-immunoprecipitation assays in vivo. Deletion mapping demonstrated that HMG-box domain of SOX4 is required to mediate the interaction with Ubc9 in yeast. Furthermore. confocal microscopy showed that Ubc9 co-localized with SOX4 in the nucleus. Luciferase assays found that Ubc9 specifically repressed SOX4 transcriptional activity in 293T cells. We further demonstrated that Ubc9 could functionally repress the transcriptional activity of endogenous SOX4 induced by progesterone in T47D cells.

1064535,Evolution of the skin-core structure of PAN-based carbon fibers with high temperature treatment,2012,CJ Su and AJ Gao and Sha Luo and LH Xu,27,New Carbon Materials,4,288-293,New Carbon Materials,PAN-based carbon fibers were subjected to high temperature heat treatment (HTT) at 1 500-2 500℃ and the evolution of the skin-core structure of the carbon fibers was investigated by elemental analysis. XRD. TEM and Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that nitrogen content and d002 decreased. and carbon content and La increased with HTT temperature. La increased sharply with temperature above 1 900℃. The Raman spectra taken at four points in radial directions indicated that the intensity of the G band at the skin was stronger than at the core with no change in peak position at 1 700℃. However. the G peak position decreased from 1 588.2 to 1 582.2 cm-1. the width of the G band at half maximum intensity decreased from 46.3 to 28.9 and that of D band from 46.9 to 36.7 cm-1 from core to skin after HTT at 2 500℃. The differences of microstructure in the core and skin at different temperatures are related closely to the differences in nitrogen removal efficiency and temperature. At temperatures below 1 900℃. nitrogen near the skin is more easily removed due to a shorter diffusion path and a higher temperature on the skin. leading to a slower increase of La with temperature on the skin than in the core. At temperatures above 1 900℃. nitrogen is removed completely and graphitization on the skin is more rapid than in the core. leading to a large skin-core difference with the skin portion having a high modulus and the core portion a high strength.,True,RQ12t_oAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,14,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-XTCL201204009.htm,17916000501020845047,/scholar?cites=17916000501020845047,,,0,0,0

Xanthi (nn. Smith)) leaf disks. We compared the effect of temperatures ranging from 15 C. 18 C. 20 C. 22 C to 25 C on the stable expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity of 14 days old hygromycin-selected leaf disks. and on the increase in the fresh weight yield of 28 days old kanamycin-selected calli. The highest average of GUS activity was obtained at 20 C among the five temperatures tested although the difference between the 18 C and 20 C treatment was not statistically significant. The GUS activity at 15 C was statistically lower than those at 18 C and 20 C. The GUS activity in 22 C treatment was an intermediate between the highest (18/20 C) and second highest averages (15 C). and was not statistically significantly different. The lowest average of GUS activity was observed at 25 C. The highest increase in the plate average of fresh weight yield was obtained at 20 C among the five temperature tested. The 20 C treatment was statistically significantly better than the 15 C and 18 C treatments. The 20 C co-cultivation treatment resulted in the higher FW yield than 22 C and 25 C even though the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion. low co-cultivation temperature at 20 C resulted in the reproducible maximum increase in both the fresh weight yield and stable expression of GUS activity after transformation of tobacco leaf disks.,True,RQ12t_oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,14,https://www.scirp.org/pdf/ajps20120400014_56766738.pdf,10316645338599616840,/scholar?cites=10316645338599616840,,https://www.scirp.org/pdf/ajps20120400014_56766738.pdf,0,0,0

The Gateway Technology vectors are kanamycin-based. thus tetracycline-based destination and expression vectors are easily selected for the antibiotic resistance in the Escherichia coli media. We reduced the size of the tetracycline resistance gene TetC from pBR322 to 1468 bp containing 1191 bp of the coding region. 93 bp of 5’-upstream. and 184 bp 3’-downstream region. The final size of binary Ti vector skeleton pLSU11 is 5034 bp. pLSU12 and 13 have the kanamycin resistance NPTII gene as a plant-selectable marker. pLSU13 and 15 contain the hygromycin resistance HPH gene as a selection marker. pLSU13 and 15 also have the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in addition to the plant selection marker. We also constructed a mobilizable version of tetracycline-based binary Ti vector pLSU16 in which the mob function of ColE1 replicon was maintained for mobilization of the binary vector from E. coli to A. tumefaciens by tri-parental mating. The final size of binary Ti vector skeleton pLSU16 is 5580 bp.

Further. the textual evidence traditionally cited in support of a pre-Columbian Old World presence of Datura species is suggested to be due to the misreading of classical Greek and Arabic sources.

Here. we computationally model the effects of intrinsic noise on the Hes1/miR-9 oscillator as a consequence of low molecular numbers of interacting species. determined experimentally. We report that increased stochasticity spreads the timing of differentiation in a population. such that initially equivalent cells differentiate over a period of time.

Using iterative experimental and computational analyses. we show physical and functional interactions between NF-κB and the E2 Factor 1 (E2F-1) and E2 Factor 4 (E2F-4) cell cycle regulators. These interactions modulate the NF-κB response. In S-phase. the NF-κB response was delayed or repressed. while cell cycle progression was unimpeded. By contrast. activation of NF-κB at the G1/S boundary resulted in a longer cell cycle and more synchronous initial NF-κB responses between cells. These data identify new mechanisms by which the cellular response to stress is differentially controlled at different stages of the cell cycle.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10473.001,True,NXYfgpAAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C,22,https://elifesciences.org/articles/10473,9720293923805637225,/scholar?cites=9720293923805637225,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/10473.pdf,0,0,0

Serum NS1 antigen levels significantly (p < 0.0001) and inversely correlated with the total white cell counts and lymphocyte counts. The bedside NS1 test showed comparable sensitivity (97.4%) and specificity (93.7%) to the laboratory NS1 test in our setting and cohort.

We compare 12 pipelines available in nine R packages for detecting differential expressions (DE) from multi-group RNA-seq count data. focusing on three-group data with or without replicates. We evaluate those pipelines on the basis of both simulation data and real count data. As a result. the pipelines in the TCC package performed comparably to or better than other pipelines under various simulation scenarios. TCC implements a multi-step normalization strategy (called DEGES) that internally uses functions provided by other representative packages (edgeR. DESeq2. and so on). We found considerably different numbers of identified DEGs (18.5 ~ 45.7 % of all genes) among the pipelines for the same real dataset but similar distributions of the classified expression patterns. We also found that DE results can roughly be estimated by the hierarchical dendrogram of sample clustering for the raw count data. We confirmed the DEGES-based pipelines implemented in TCC performed well in a three-group comparison as well as a two-group comparison. We recommend using the DEGES-based pipeline that internally uses edgeR (here called the EEE-E pipeline) for count data with replicates (especially for small sample …,True,uXILKTUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,40,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0794-7,3018484783530512287,/scholar?cites=3018484783530512287,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-015-0794-7,0,0,0

However. the roles of ceRNAs in thyroid carcinoma remains elusive. In this study. we have developed a novel pipeline called Molecular Network-based Identification of ceRNA (MNIceRNA) to identify ceRNAs in thyroid carcinoma. MNIceRNA first constructs micro RNA (miRNA)–messenger RNA (mRNA) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) networks from miRcode database and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). based on which to identify key drivers of differentially expressed RNAs between normal and tumor samples. It then infers ceRNAs of the identified key drivers using the long non-coding competing endogenous database (lnCeDB). We applied the pipeline into The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) thyroid carcinoma data. As a result. 598 lncRNAs. 1025 mRNAs. and 90 microRNA (miRNAs) were inferred to be differentially expressed between normal and thyroid cancer samples. We then obtained eight key driver miRNAs. among which hsa-mir-221 and hsa-mir-222 were key driver RNAs identified by both miRNA–mRNA–lncRNA and WGCNA network. In addition. hsa-mir-375 was inferred to be significant for patients’ survival with 34 associated ceRNAs. among which RUNX2. DUSP6 and SEMA3D are known oncogenes regulating cellular proliferation and differentiation in thyroid cancer. These ceRNAs are critical in revealing the secrets behind thyroid cancer progression and may serve as future therapeutic biomarkers.

High-throughput techniques based on ‘-omics’ have driven the discovery of biomarkers in diseases and therapeutic targets of drugs. A transcriptome is the complete set of all RNAs transcribed by certain tissues or cells at a specific stage of development or physiological condition. Transcriptome research can demonstrate gene functions and structures from the whole level and reveal the molecular mechanism of specific biological processes in diseases. Currently. gene expression microarray and high-throughput RNA-sequencing have been widely used in biological. medical. clinical and drug research. The former has been applied in drug screening and biomarker detection of drugs due to its high throughput. fast detection speed. simple analysis and relatively low price. With the further development of detection technology and the improvement of analytical methods. the detection flux of RNA-seq is much higher but the price is lower. hence it has powerful advantages in detecting biomarkers and drug discovery. Compared with the traditional RNA-seq. scRNA-seq has higher accuracy and efficiency. especially the single-cell level of gene expression pattern analysis can provide more information for drug and biomarker discovery. Therefore. (sc)RNA-seq has broader application prospects. especially in the field of drug discovery. In this overview. we will review the application of these technologies in drug. especially in natural drug and biomarker discovery and development.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome. characterized by a rapid onset of generalized inflammation. is the leading cause of mortality of patients with COVID-19. Thus. we aimed to explore the effect of risk factors on the severity of the disease. focusing on immune-inflammatory parameters which represent the immune status of patients. Methods A comprehensive systematic search for relevant studies published up to April 2020 was performed by using PubMed. Web of Science. EMBASE. China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI) databases. After extracting all available data of immune-inflammatory indicators. we statistically analyzed the risk factors of severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients with meta-analysis. Results A total number of 4911 patients from 29 studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that severe patients tend to present higher level of white blood cell (WBC). neutrophil. neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). procalcitonin (PCT). C-reaction protein (CRP). erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and decreased number of total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subtypes such as CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte compared to the nonsevere patients.

The mechanisms regulating FLC gene expression and protein function have been studied extensively; however. post-translational regulation of FLC remains unclear. Here. we identified Arabidopsis HIGH PLOIDY2 (HPY2) as an E3 SUMO ligase for FLC. In vitro and vivo pull-down assays showed that FLC physically interacts with HPY2. In vitro assays showed that the stimulation of FLC sumoylation by HPY2 was dependent on SUMO-activating enzyme E1 and -conjugating enzyme E2. indicating that HPY2 was an E3 SUMO ligase for FLC. In transgenic plants. inducible HPY2 overexpression increased the concentration of FLC. indicating that HPY2 stabilized FLC through direct sumoylation. Flowering time in hpy2-2 mutants was shorter than in wild-type plants under long- and short-day conditions. with a greater effect under short-day conditions. and FLC was downregulated in hpy2-2 mutants.

Here. we demonstrate that the DNA methylation activity of Arabidopsis CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) is positively regulated by the E3 SUMO ligase AtSIZ1. The methylation level of the Arabidopsis genome. including transposons. was significantly lower in the siz1-2 mutant than in wild-type plants.

Here. we show that Xoo-induced rice leaf blight is effectively controlled by niclosamide. an oral antihelminthic drug and molluscicide. which also functions as an anti-tumor agent. Niclosamide directly inhibited the growth of the three Xoo strains PXO99. 10208 and K3a. Niclosamide moved long distances from the site of local application to distant rice tissues. Niclosamide also increased the levels of salicylate and induced the expression of defense-related genes such as OsPR1 and OsWRKY45. which suppressed Xoo-induced leaf wilting. Niclosamide had no detrimental effects on vegetative/reproductive growth and yield. These combined results indicate that niclosamide can be used to block bacterial leaf blight in rice with no negative side effects.,True,AZ1U-nsAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,15,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21209,3908855560967698211,/scholar?cites=3908855560967698211,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21209,0,0,0

Here. we show that the E3 SUMO ligase AtSIZ1 regulates seed dormancy and germination. The germination rates of the siz1 mutants were less than 50%. even after a short period of ripening. However. their germination rates increased to wild‐type levels after cold stratification or long periods of ripening. In addition. exogenous gibberellin (GA) application improved the germination rates of the siz1 mutants to the wild‐type level. In transgenic plants. suppression of AtSIZ1 caused rapid post‐translational decay of SLEEPY1 (SLY1). a positive regulator of GA signaling. during germination. and inducible AtSIZ1 overexpression led to increased SLY1 levels.

Here. E3 SUMO ligase was shown to regulate alternative respiratory pathways and to participate in the maintenance of carbon and nitrogen balance in Arabidopsis. The transcript abundance of the type II NAD (P) H dehydrogenases NDA2 and NDB2 and alternative oxidases AOX1a and AOX1d genes was low in siz1-2 mutants compared to that in wild-type. The addition of nitrate or ammonium resulted in a decrease or an increase in the expression of the same gene families. respectively. in both wild-type and siz1-2 mutants. The amount of free sugar (glucose. fructose and sucrose) was lower in siz1-2 mutants than that in wild-type. These results indicate that low nitrate reductase activity due to the AtSIZ1 mutation is correlated with an overall decrease in alternative respiration and with a low carbohydrate content to maintain the carbon to nitrogen ratio in siz1-2 mutants.,True,AZ1U-nsAAAAJ:NJ774b8OgUMC,9,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201220962914621.page,16099884841691325039,/scholar?cites=16099884841691325039,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201220962914621.pdf,0,0,0

Our previous work showed that methylation of the nitrate reductase (NR) gene NIA2 was dependent on chromomethylase 3 (CMT3). Here. we show that CMT3-mediated NIA2 methylation is regulated by ammonium in Arabidopsis thaliana. CHG sequences (where H can be A. T. or C) were methylated in NIA2 but not in NIA1. and ammonium [(NH4)2SO4] treatment completely blocked CHG methylation in NIA2. By contrast. ammonium had no effect on CMT3 methylation. indicating that ammonium negatively regulates CMT3-mediated NIA2 methylation without affecting CMT3 methylation. Ammonium upregulated NIA2 mRNA expression. which was consistent with the repression of NIA2 methylation by ammonium. Ammonium treatment also reduced the overall genome methylation level of wild-type Arabidopsis. Moreover. CMT3 bound to specific promoter and intragenic regions of NIA2. These combined results indicate that ammonium inhibits CMT3-mediated methylation of NIA2 and that of other target genes. and CMT3 selectively binds to target DNA sequences for methylation.,True,AZ1U-nsAAAAJ:0KyAp5RtaNEC,8,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.01161/full,13679459178433964618,/scholar?cites=13679459178433964618,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2015.01161/full,0,0,0

Thus. various methods have been applied to protect rice from this disease. Here. we show systemic translocation of the human drug niclosamide (5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide) in rice and its long-term effect on prevention of rice leaf blight. The development of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae-induced rice leaf blight was effectively inhibited in untreated systemic leaves as in niclosamide-treated leaves. although its effect gradually decreased in a time-dependent manner. Time-course examination after niclosamide treatment showed that the niclosamide level was highest after 3 h in non-treated distal leaves. suggesting fast systemic movement of niclosamide from the treated local site to untreated distal regions.

They are distributed as isoenzymes in distinct cellular compartments. such as the cytosol. mitochondria and peroxisomes. where they play essential roles in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting cells against the toxic effects of these species in higher plants. algae. euglena and other organisms. APXs also respond to environmental stresses. such as salinity and drought. and rice ascorbate peroxidase 1 (OsAPx1) participates in salinity tolerance. However. it is still unclear how OsAPx1 is involved in growth and development before and after flowering. Here. we show that OsAPx1 plays an important function in seed development. including fertilization. Proteomic analysis and quantitative RT-PCR showed that protein and mRNA levels of OsAPx1 were much higher in immature seeds than in mature seeds. Plant height and grain size in an Osapx1 mutant were almost the same as those in wild-type plants. However. about 58% of the seeds were aborted in the Osapx1 mutant. although the mutant was capable of normal flowering.

We examined the ability to capture light in the Cryptophyta. a phylum of single-celled eukaryotic algae with diverse photosynthetic pigments. to better understand how acquisition of an abiotic resource may be associated with diversification. Cryptophytes originated through secondary endosymbiosis between an unknown eukaryotic host and a red algal symbiont.

They are potent inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A) and cause a variety of adverse symptoms in humans and animals if ingested. More than 250 chemically diverse congeners of MCs have been identified. but certified reference materials are only available for a few. A diagnostic test that does not require each reference material for detection is necessary to identify human exposures. To address this need. our lab has developed a method that uses an antibody to specifically isolate MCs and NOD from urine prior to detection via a commercially available PP2A kit. This assay quantitates the summed inhibitory activity of nearly all MCs and NOD on PP2A relative to a common MC congener. microcystin-LR (MC-LR). The quantitation range for MC-LR using this method is from 0.050–0.500 ng/mL. No background responses were detected in a convenience set of 50 individual urines. Interday and intraday% accuracies ranged from 94%–118% and relative standard deviations were 15% or less. meeting FDA guidelines for receptor binding assays.

In order to replicate. viruses must first infect a host and then use the host’s cellular machinery to produce new viral particles. Some of the most abundant viral hosts in the subtropical open ocean are picophytoplankton. However. picophytoplankton growth is typically constrained by nutrient availability. In many regions of the ocean. iron (Fe) is only available in very low concentrations causing growth-limitation of picophytoplankton. Interestingly. the interactions between Fe-limitation and viral infection of picophytoplankton have not been extensively studied.

As climate is an important mechanism for the establishment of crop success or failure. climate pattern mapping and climate mapping of a region are important in terms of risk assessment of pest as well as for bio-control introduction. In long term. climate change will lead to shifts in the geographic range of species. gradually destroying existing combination of species and creating new ones. Local community richness will tend to decline with these changes and invasive alien species may compensate for the loss of native species. Synergistic effects of climate change with habitat destruction have been predicted to be the major cause of extinction. The loss of key species such as pollinators and parasitoids may have critical effects on the whole birth community. A vast range of permutation of climate variables has to be taken in consideration to predict the distribution. and geographical abundance of a number of crop pests.Eco-climatic assessment can provide valuable insight in species distribution. in relation to relevant climate data. particularly relating to the assessment of the potential establishment of a particular bio-control species. In present scenario. detailed climate data has to be associated with GIS system that provides information on land use and topography. and would help to indicate microclimates of species.

Eight rats of each gender were assigned to each of the following groups: control groups were intact female or male (F and M. resp.). Experimental groups were ovariectomized F (OvxF). castrated M (CasM). OvxF plus testosterone (OvxF + T). and CasM plus estradiol (CasM + E2) groups. After sacrifice. retroperitoneal fat was dissected and processed for histology. Adipocytes were isolated and the following enzymatic activities were determined: Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD). catalase (CAT). glutathione peroxidase (GPx). glutathione-S-transferase (GST). and glutathione reductase (GR). Also. glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured. In OvxF. retroperitoneal fat increased and adipocytes were enlarged. while in CasM rats a decrease in retroperitoneal fat and small adipocytes are observed. The cross-sex hormonal replacement in F rats was associated with larger adipocytes and a further decreased activity of Cu-Zn SOD. CAT. GPx. GST. GR. and GSH. in addition to an increase in LPO. CasM + E2 exhibited the opposite effects showing further activation antioxidant enzymes and decreases in LPO. In conclusion.

However. there is little consensus on the optimal data input for generating PRS. and existing approaches largely preclude the use of imputed posterior probabilities and strand-ambiguous SNPs i.e.. A/T or C/G polymorphisms. Our ability to predict complex traits that arise from the additive effects of a large number of SNPs would likely benefit from a more inclusive approach. We developed PRS-on-Spark (PRSoS). a software implemented in Apache Spark and Python that accommodates different data inputs and strand-ambiguous SNPs to calculate PRS. We compared performance between PRSoS and an existing software (PRSice v1.25) for generating PRS for major depressive disorder using a community cohort (N = 264).

HBM-MSCs were obtained from three insulin-dependent type 2 diabetic volunteers. Following expansion. cells were differentiated according to a trichostatin-A/GLP protocol. One million cells were transplanted under the renal capsule of 29 diabetic nude mice. Blood glucose. serum human insulin and c-peptide levels. and glucose tolerance curves were determined. Mice were euthanized 1. 2. 4. or 12 weeks after transplantation. IPC-bearing kidneys were immunolabeled. number of IPCs was counted. and expression of relevant genes was determined. At the end of in vitro differentiation. all pancreatic endocrine genes were expressed. albeit at very low values. The percentage of IPCs among transplanted cells was small (≤3%). Diabetic animals became euglycemic  days after transplantation. Thereafter. the percentage of IPCs reached a mean of ~18% at 4 weeks. Relative gene expression of insulin. glucagon. and somatostatin showed a parallel increase. The ability of the transplanted cells to induce euglycemia was due to their further maturation in the favorable in vivo microenvironment.

The use of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a source for Insulin-Producing Cells (IIPCs) provides a chance for an autologous application. Hence. the use of encapsulation for immune isolation may not be necessary. Differentiated Bone Marrow-Derived (BM-MSCs) from Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used to treat chemically-induced diabetes in an in bred group. IPCs were loaded onto a PLG scaffold and transplanted subcutaneously. Out of 9 surviving rats. only 4 became euglycemic. It was postulated that this modest outcome may be due to lack of sufficient immediate oxygenation. An intense foreign body tissue reaction induced by the scaffold material could be an additional detrimental factor to the transplanted cells. For a successful transplant. the scaffold material should not only be biodegradable and biocompatible. but should also induce a minimal foreign body tissue reaction. Furthermore. the blood supply to the transplanted cell should be adequate. This could be achieved in a 2-staged procedure. by preparing a vascularized bed before transplantation. A one-stage procedure is also possible provided that a drug delivery component is incorporated to allow immediate oxygenation. promote early vascularization and provide suitable growth factors.,True,Th6JHyUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayman_Refaie/publication/339602243_From_Mesenchymal_Stromal_Stem_Cells_to_Insulin-Producing_Cells_Challenges_in_Translation_for_a_Clinical_Application/links/5e5ba9eb92851cefa1d26864/From-Mesenchymal-Stromal-Stem-Cells-to-Insulin-Producing-Cells-Challenges-in-Translation-for-a-Clinical-Application.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayman_Refaie/publication/339602243_From_Mesenchymal_Stromal_Stem_Cells_to_Insulin-Producing_Cells_Challenges_in_Translation_for_a_Clinical_Application/links/5e5ba9eb92851cefa1d26864/From-Mesenchymal-Stromal-Stem-Cells-to-Insulin-Producing-Cells-Challenges-in-Translation-for-a-Clinical-Application.pdf,0,0,0

1064871,Assessment of the role of an Ω loop of cholesterol oxidase: a truncated loop mutant has altered substrate specificity,1998,Nicole S Sampson and Ignatius J Kass and Kajal Bose Ghoshroy,37,Biochemistry,16,5770-5778,American Chemical Society,The function of an active site loop (70−90) of cholesterol oxidase has been ascertained by deleting five contiguous residues (79−83) from the tip of the loop. From the crystal structure of the wild-type enzyme. it appears that this truncation will not significantly perturb the structure of the rest of the enzyme. The UV/vis and CD spectra of the mutant confirm that the enzyme is properly folded with FAD bound. The mutant enzyme still transfers 2H from the 4β-carbon of the intermediate. cholest-5-en-3-one. to the 6β-carbon of the product. cholest-4-en-3-one. during isomerization.

In the present study we have examined the possibility that both of these two Na+ transporters might be present in endosome-enriched microsomes isolated from rabbit renal cortex. After the establishment of a stable pH gradient by ATP in this preparation. addition of Na+ induced a decrease in the pH gradient. Expression of this effect of Na+ did not require the presence of ATP or K+. Choline and K+ had no effect on the ATP-dependent pH gradient. but addition of Li+ caused a small reduction in the pH gradient.

Confocal laser scanning. light. transmission and scanning electron microscopy and immunolabeling techniques were used to study the pattern of the viral movement in reproductive parts of the systemically infected plant. The virus was located in all parts of the flower except ovules and pollen grains. The viral movement was thus confined to the junction of ovule and ovule stalk in the siliques and outside the pollen grains in anther tissue. Subcellular localization of (1> 3)-β-glucan (callose) indicated selective deposition of this substance in plasmodesmata at the junction of ovule and ovule stalk as well as exine layer of pollen grains. The callose deposition was not observed in uninoculated and mock inoculated control plants. We propose that the observed (1> 3)-β-glucan may be involved in blockage of viral movement into ovules and pollen grains and result possibly in non-seed transmission of TVCV in A. thaliana.,True,D_EI86MAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,2,https://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=DJ2012054314,529159683973126779,/scholar?cites=529159683973126779,,,0,0,0

The basidiomycete. Laetisaria arvalis has been reported to have biological control activity over some plant pathogens. In a preliminary experiment. L. arvalis inhibited growth of P. teres on agar plates. The observation however. did not elucidate the mechanisms of the P. teres inhibition by L. arvalis. This research was initiated to utilize electron microscopy techniques to examine the interaction between L. arvalis and P. teres to study the basis for previously observed inhibition. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the interaction of the two fungi. To date. our microscopy data indicated structural changes of the hyphae in both P. teres and L. arvalis as the fungi interact. Additional examination of interacting colonies of the two fungi growing on agar shows loss of structural integrity in P. teres hyphae. whereas the L. arvalis hyphae remain intact. This includes the formation of large perforations in P. teres hyphae over time indicating possible degradation of P. teres hyphae resulting in its growth inhibition. This observation strongly confirms the likely inhibition of P. teres by L. arvalis. Additional experiments are in progress to better understand this interaction at the subcellular level to serve as basis for the development a biological control system of P. teres with L. arvalis.,True,D_EI86MAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=265798,,,,,0,0,0

Sepsis is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in newborn dairy calves. The main challenges with the use of biomarkers of sepsis in domestic animals are their availability. cost. and time required to obtain a result. Metabolomics may offer the potential to identify biomarkers that define calf sepsis in terms of combined clinical. physiological. and pathobiological abnormalities. To our knowledge. this is the first study presenting an NMR- (nuclear magnetic resonance-) based plasma metabolomics at set intervals in neonatal septic calves. Twenty neonatal dairy calves with severe sepsis and ten healthy calves were used. Hematological and biochemical health profiles were gathered in plasma samples at set intervals. Similarly. NMR spectra were acquired. All diseased animals (except one) died after 72 hours. Clinical and laboratory results were in accordance with those of severe septic animals. Multivariate analysis on NMR plasma spectra proved to be an excellent tool for faster identification of calves with severe sepsis from healthy animals.

It is well known that invasive species like L. gibbosus adapt to introduced habitats relatively well. In order to evaluate morphological variation within this invasive species. sampling was carried out in June 2012 and May 2013 in the Aegean and Thrace regions. respectively. Body-form variability in sampled populations of L. gibbosus was investigated using landmark-based geometric morphometrics. L. gibbosus showed significant geographic-and habitat-based differences with and without allometric standardization. However. outcomes of these results differed significantly. Differences between locality-based Procrustes distances were found to support habitat-based differentiation. These results suggest that. depending on the hypothesis of the morphometric study. it might be important to implement allometric regression and standardization.

Their residency and movement patterns were monitored using 27 moored acoustic receivers spanning both riverine and estuarine habitats between January and November 2013. Small-scale movements ranging from 50 to 400 m occurred between pools in the headwater region. where tagged fish remained resident (did not leave their tagging pool) during the warmer (summer) months. The onset of autumn and winter correlated with declining water temperatures and half of the tagged largemouth bass made downstream excursions into the slightly warmer upper reaches of the estuary.

Three different morphological forms of T. tuerki are distinguished based on the wings and prothorax lengths: brachypterous. mesopterous and macropterous forms. Only two forms of adults (mesopterous and brachypterous) and the larvae of middle and the last instars hibernate. Adults of macropterous individuals of T. tuerki appear in June. developing from the hibernated larvae. Some larvae of T. tuerki are emerged from eggs and become the adults at the same year. transforming mesopterous and brachypterous forms. In spring T. tuerki (brachypterous and mesopterous individuals) lives on sandy-pebble alluvion of mountain river coasts. but in summer it (macropterous individuals) prefers alluvions near the middle part of the river far from its coasts. All three morphological forms of T. tuerki inhabit the middle flows of mountain rivers and the foothills outside a mountain system; brachypterous and mesopterous individuals are widespread in the upper reaches and in the lower flows of mountain rivers where alluvions are rare.

Adaptation and regulation of the sterile caste. to a certain extent. drives the evolution of eusociality. Depending on adaptive functions of the first evolved sterile caste. eusocial societies can be categorized into the worker-first and soldier-first lineages. respectively. The former is marked by a worker caste as the first evolved altruistic caste. whose primary function is housekeeping. and the latter is highlighted by a sterile soldier caste as the first evolved altruistic caste. whose task is predominantly colony defense. The apparent functional differences between these two fundamentally important castes suggest worker-first and soldier-first eusociality are potentially driven by a suite of distinctively different factors.

1064968,morphological characterization and staging of bumble bee pupae,2018,Li Tian and Heather Hines,6,PeerJ,,e6089,,Bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae. Bombus) are important pollinators and models for studying mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity. such as factors influencing size. immunity. and social behaviors. Research on such processes. as well as expanding use of gene-manipulation and gene expression technologies. requires a detailed understanding of how these bees develop. Developmental research often uses time-staging of pupae. however dramatic size differences in these bees can generate variation in developmental timing. To study developmental mechanisms in bumble bees. appropriate staging of developing bees using morphology is necessary. In this study. we describe morphological changes across development in several bumble bee species and use this to establish morphology-based staging criteria. establishing 20 distinct illustrated stages. These criteria. defined largely by eye and cuticle pigmentation patterns. are generalizable across members of the subgenus Pyrobombus. and can be used as a framework for study of other bumble bee subgenera. We examine the effects of temperature. caste. size. and species on pupal development. revealing that pupal duration shifts with each of these factors. confirming the importance of staging pupae based on morphology rather than age and the need for standardizing sampling.,True,A0at6uEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,9,https://peerj.com/articles/6089/,11207223357212215918,/scholar?cites=11207223357212215918,,https://peerj.com/articles/6089/,0,0,0

Cues from aggressive competitors should be particularly likely to evoke behavioral and/or physiological responses. since they may be indicative of both direct (interference) and indirect (exploitative) threats. The danger posed by such competitors. and the “fear” they evoke. should be reduced at lower competitor densities and by the presence of individual conspecifics specialized for defense. We assessed how Reticulitermes flavipes termite workers and soldiers were affected by cues from conspecific nestmates. conspecific non‐nestmates. and the heterospecific competitor R. virginicus. Competitor cues altered flavipes worker and soldier behavior. decreasing worker growth and increasing their mortality. The presence of flavipes soldiers largely ameliorated these …,True,A0at6uEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,5,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.1746,10753394459814721480,/scholar?cites=10753394459814721480,,https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1158&context=bio_facpubs,0,0,0
