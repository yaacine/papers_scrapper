Quantum cryptography is now headed towards solving the practical problem of constructing scalable and secure quantum networks. A significant step in this direction has been the introduction of measurement-device independence. where the secret key between two parties is established by the measurement of an untrusted relay.

Several quantum key distribution schemes based on coherent states and continuous variable measurements are resilient to high loss in the channel. but are strongly affected by small amounts of channel excess noise.

Finally. we use those states to generalize a previously known error correction protocol by making it able to correct noise coming from thermal loss channels. and we also show how finite-energy resource states are able to provide tight upper bounds to the secret-key capacity of Gaussian channels.,True,ZFTpPmcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019APS..MARS27012T/abstract,,,,,0,0,0
1176398,Advances in the theory of channel simulation: from quantum communication to quantum sensing,2018,Riccardo Laurenza,,,,,,In this thesis we investigate the fundamental limitations that the laws of the quantum nature impose on the performance of quantum communications. quantum metrology and quantum channel discrimination. In a quantum communication scenario. the typical tasks are represented by the simple transmission of quantum bits. the distribution of entangle- ment and the sharing of quantum secret keys. The ultimate rates for each of these protocols are given by the two-way quantum capacities of the quantum channel which are in turn defined by considering the most general adaptive strategies that can be implemented over the channel. To assess these quantum capacities. we combine the simulation of quantum channels. suitably generalized to systems of arbitrary dimension. with quantum telepor- tation and the relative entropy of entanglement. This procedure is called teleportation stretching. Relying on this. we are able to reduce any adaptive protocols into simpler block ones and to determine the tightest upper bound on the two-way quantum capacities. Re- markably. we also prove the existence of a particular class of quantum channel for which the lower and the upper bounds coincide. By employing a slight modification of the tele- portation scheme. allowing the two parties to share a multi-copy resource state. we apply our technique to simplify adaptive protocols for quantum metrology and quantum channel discrimination. In the first case we show that the modified teleportation stretching implies a quantum Cram ́er-Rao bound that follows asymptotically the Heisenberg scaling. In the second scenario we are able to derive the only known so far …,True,ZFTpPmcAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/23277,,,,,0,0,0

Hence it can be characterized from the point of view of communication theory. ie. in terms of its ability to transfer information. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the proper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of codes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them from the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error correction. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the channel not as acting on a single system. but on sequences of systems. which. when properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by the physical process under consideration.

First. we show that the problem of estimating the separation between two pointlike sources is equivalent to the estimation of the loss parameters of two lossy bosonic channels. ie. the transmissivities of two beam splitters. Using this representation. we establish the ultimate precision bound for resolving two pointlike sources in an arbitrary quantum state. with a simple formula for the specific case of two thermal sources. We find that the precision bound scales with the number of collected photons according to the standard quantum limit.

1176419,Exponentially enhanced quantum communication rate by multiplexing continuous-variable teleportation,2012,Andreas Christ and Cosmo Lupo and Christine Silberhorn,14,New Journal of Physics,8,083007,IOP Publishing,A major challenge of today’s quantum communication systems lies in the transmission of quantum information with high rates over long distances in the presence of unavoidable losses. Thereby the achievable quantum communication rate is fundamentally limited by the amount of energy that can be transmitted per use of the channel. It is hence vital to develop quantum communication protocols that encode quantum information as energy efficiently as possible. To this aim we investigate continuous-variable quantum teleportation as a method of distributing quantum information. We explore the possibility to encode information on multiple optical modes and derive upper and lower bounds on the achievable quantum channel capacities. This analysis enables us to benchmark single-mode versus multi-mode entanglement resources. Our research reveals that multiplexing does not only feature an enhanced energy …,True,ldF-djEAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,22,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/14/8/083007/meta,3210184550865284127,/scholar?cites=3210184550865284127,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/14/8/083007/pdf,0,0,0

1176421,Robust quantum data locking from phase modulation,2014,Cosmo Lupo and Mark M Wilde and Seth Lloyd,90,Physical Review A,2,022326,American Physical Society,Quantum data locking is a uniquely quantum phenomenon that allows a relatively short key of constant size to (un) lock an arbitrarily long message encoded in a quantum state. in such a way that an eavesdropper who measures the state but does not know the key has essentially no information about the message. The application of quantum data locking in cryptography would allow one to overcome the limitations of the one-time pad encryption. which requires the key to have the same length as the message. However. it is known that the strength of quantum data locking is also its Achilles heel. as the leakage of a few bits of the key or the message may in principle allow the eavesdropper to unlock a disproportionate amount of information.

1176433,The Binary-Outcome Detection Loophole,2020,Thomas Cope,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.03344,,,,The detection loophole problem arises when quantum devices fail to provide an output for some of the experimental runs. These failures allow for the possibility of a local hidden-variable description of the resulting statistics; even if the correlations obtained from successful runs appear non-local. This is of particular significance in device-independent quantum cryptography. where verifiable non-locality is a necessary requirement for the security proof. For every scenario characterised by the amount of devices. along with the number of inputs and outputs available to them. there is a detection threshold-if the efficiency of the device falls below this no verification is possible. In this work I present an intuitive local hidden-variable construction for all no-signalling distributions with two parties and binary outcomes. This provides a lower bound on the detection threshold for quantum measurements in the same scenario tighter than known previously. When both parties have the same number of inputs into their device. this construction is shown optimal for small input numbers.

Different solutions have been proposed to accomplish such a challenging task. which. however. require either an ad hoc engineering of the internal interactions of the physical system acting as the channel or specific initialization procedures. Here we show that optimal dynamics for efficient quantum-state and entanglement transfer can be attained in generic quantum systems with homogeneous interactions by tuning the coupling between the system and the two attached qubits. We devise a general procedure to determine the optimal coupling. and we explicitly implement it in the case of a channel consisting of a spin-1 2 XY chain.

We show that j opt 0 (N) scales as N− 1/6 for large N and that it ensures a high-quality entanglement transfer even in the limit of arbitrarily long channels. almost independently of the channel initialization. For instance. for any chain length the average quantum-state transmission fidelity exceeds 90% and decreases very little in a broad neighbourhood of j opt 0 (N).

This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states. Gaussian operations. and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly. such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits. since on the theoretical side. simple analytical tools are available and. on the experimental side. optical components effecting Gaussian processes …,True,OXlD-EQAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C,2143,https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.84.621,12014221578888835752,/scholar?cites=12014221578888835752,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.3234,0,0,0

We apply this time-dependent Hamiltonian approach to Grover’s problem. ie. searching a marked item in an unstructured database. We find that by adjusting the evolution rate of the Hamiltonian so as to keep the evolution adiabatic on each infinitesimal time interval. the total running time is of order N. where N is the number of items in the database. We thus recover the advantage of Grover’s standard algorithm as compared to a classical search. scaling as N.

The quantum world allows for completely new architectures and protocols. While originally formulated in continuous quantum variables. the field worked almost exclusively with discrete variables. such as single photons and photon pairs. The renaissance of continuous variables came with European research consortia such as ACQUIRE (Advanced Coherent Quantum Information Research) in the late 1990s. and QUICOV (Quantum Information with Continuous Variables) from 2000-2003. The encouraging research results of QUICOV and the new conference series CVQIP (Continuous Variable Quantum Information Processing) triggered the idea for this book. This book presents the state of the art of quantum information with continuous quantum variables. The individual chapters discuss results achieved in QUICOV and presented at the first five CVQIP conferences from 2002-2006.

We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent to the quantum transmission. that is. using Bob's instead of Alice's data to build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the resistance to noise. they are not required for the protocols to remain secure with high losses. Therefore. these protocols can be implemented very simply by transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here. we show that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol. even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in the absence of squeezing. for coherent state protocols. This``virtual''entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.,True,OXlD-EQAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,256,https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306141,12492162532189713598,/scholar?cites=12492162532189713598,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0306141,0,0,0

Any separable state is mapped by the tensor product of Γ and the identity into a non-negative operator. which provides a simple necessary condition for separability. This condition is generally not sufficient because it is vulnerable to the dilution of entanglement. In the special case where one subsystem is a quantum bit. Γ reduces to time reversal. so that this separability condition is equivalent to partial transposition. It is therefore also sufficient for 2× 2 and 2× 3 systems.

A misread codon often codes for the same amino acid or one with similar biochemical properties. so the structure and function of the coded protein remain relatively unaltered. Previous studies have attempted to address this question quantitatively. by estimating the fraction of randomly generated codes that do better than the genetic code in respect of overall robustness. We extended these results by investigating the role of amino-acid frequencies in the optimality of the genetic code. We found that taking the amino-acid frequency into account decreases the fraction of random codes that beat the natural code. This effect is particularly pronounced when more refined measures of the amino-acid substitution cost are used than hydrophobicity.

Hence it can be characterized from the point of view of communication theory. ie. in terms of its ability to transfer information. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the proper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of codes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them from the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error correction. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the channel not as acting on a single system. but on sequences of systems. which. when properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by the physical process under consideration.

We describe a sensing scheme that uses continuous-variable multipartite entanglement to enhance distributed sensing of field-quadrature displacement. By dividing a squeezed-vacuum state between multiple homodyne-sensor nodes using a lossless beam-splitter array. we obtain a root-mean-square (rms) estimation error that scales inversely with the number of nodes (Heisenberg scaling). whereas the rms error of a distributed sensor that does not exploit entanglement is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of nodes (standard quantum limit scaling).

Rev. A 94. 012322 (2016)]. Security proofs for two-way protocols. however. are underdeveloped at present. In this paper. we establish a security proof framework for the general coherent attack on two-way Gaussian protocols in the asymptotic regime. We first prove that coherent-attack security can be reduced to collective-attack security for all two-way QKD protocols. Next. we identify two different constraints that each provide intrusion parameters which bound an eavesdropper's coherent-attack information gain for any two-way Gaussian QKD protocol.

Entanglement assistance can often simplify this task. as the entanglement-assisted classical capacity for any channel is additive. making entanglement across channel uses unnecessary. If the entanglement assistance is limited. the picture is much more unclear. Suppose the classical capacity is superadditive. then the classical capacity with limited entanglement assistance could retain superadditivity by continuity arguments. If the classical capacity is additive. it is unknown if superadditivity can still be developed with limited entanglement assistance. We show this is possible. by providing an example.

Understanding its ultimate limits will give insight into a wide range of quantum protocols and applications. from sensing to communication. Although the limits of hypothesis testing between quantum states have been completely clarified by the pioneering works of Helstrom in the 1970s. the more difficult problem of hypothesis testing with quantum channels. ie. channel discrimination. is less understood. This is mainly due to the complications coming from the use of input entanglement and the possibility of employing adaptive strategies. In this Letter. we establish a lower limit for the ultimate error probability affecting the discrimination of an arbitrary number of quantum channels. We also show that this lower bound is achievable when the channels have certain symmetries.

Cham,In the two decades since Shor’s celebrated quantum algorithm for integer factorisation. manual design has failed to produce the anticipated growth in the number of quantum algorithms. Hence. there is a great deal of interest in the automatic synthesis of quantum circuits and algorithms. Here we present a set of experiments which use Ant Programming to automatically synthesise quantum circuits. In the proposed approach. ants choosing paths in high-dimensional Cartesian space are analogous to transformation of qubits in Hilbert space. In addition to the proposed algorithm. we introduce new evaluation criteria for searching the space of quantum circuits. both for classical simulation and simulation on a quantum computer.

Where target ranging is a concern. signal and idler recombination forms a crucial barrier to the protocol's success. This could potentially be mitigated if performing a measurement on the idler mode could still yield a quantum advantage. In this article. we investigate the QI protocol for a generically correlated Gaussian source and study the phase-conjugating (PC) receiver. deriving the associated SNR in terms of the signal and idler energies. and their cross-correlations. which may be readily adapted to incorporate added noise due to Gaussian measurements.

With its capabilities hinging on a joint-measurement between a returning signal and its retained idler. an unknown return time makes a QI-based protocol difficult to realise. This paper outlines a potential QI-based approach to quantum target ranging based on recent developments in multiple quantum hypothesis testing and quantum-enhanced channel position finding (CPF). Applying CPF to time bins. one finds an upper-bound on the error probability for quantum target ranging.

In this study wheat aphid had fed on wheat (main host) and oleander (compulsory host) for twenty days. For the experiments we used 3rd and 4th instars of aphids and 2nd instar larvae of green lacewing. The results were compared by each other and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii). Significant effects of host plant and aphid species on feeding rate and longevity of green lacewing were observed. The average feeding rate of 2nd instar larvae of C. carnea on wheat aphid fed on wheat. oleander aphid and wheat aphid fed on oleander were 40.3. 19.5. 30.6 aphids respectively. Also the longevity of 2nd instar larvae of green lacewing which fed on different aphids was recorded as 3.7. 7.8 and 6 days respectively.

1176678,Choosing among multiple equally parsimonious cladograms,1988,James M Carpenter,4,Cladistics,3,291-296,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,With the realization that multiple equally parsimonious cladograms might exist for a given data set (Mickevich. 1978). construction of classifications in such instances became a problem. Consensus trees (Adams. 1972; Nelson. 1979). originally developed for producing a “compromise classification”(Adams. 1972) between cladograms produced from dzferenl data sets. is one possible solution. The consensus tree. representing the information on grouping shared by all the competing cladograms. might be viewed as a “conservative” classification. Such a viewpoint has been advocated by proponents ofdistance techniques in the case ofmultiple trees ofnear-optimal fit (eg Prager and Wilson. 1978). In this case. such a procedure is a misapplication. The consensus tree. being less resolved than any of the cladograms from which it is calculated. has less explanatory power (Farris. 1983) than any of them. and so any of the competing cladograms would br a better choice as a phylogenetic hypothesis/classification. Mickevich and Farris (1981) and Miyamoto (1985) make similar points. The question is then how to choose among the cladograms. if this can be done. Recently. Brooks et al.(1986) have addressed the issue of choice among multiple equally parsimonious cladograms. However. their discussion is deficient. They considered three statistics: the consistency index (Kluge and Farris. 1959). F-ratio (a simple function of Farris’(1972) f statistic) and the D measure. an application of the Shannon entropy statistic from Gatlin (1972).

The finding that. in large molecular data sets. removal of third positions (with more homoplasy) decreases the number of well supported groups has been interpreted by some authors as indicating that weighting methods are unjustified. Two arguments against that interpretation are advanced. Characters that collectively determine few well‐supported groups may be highly reliable when taken individually (as shown by specific examples). so that inferring greater reliability for sets of characters that lead to an increase in jackknife frequencies may not always be warranted. But even if changes in jackknife frequencies can be used to infer reliability. we demonstrate that jackknife frequencies in large molecular data sets are actually improved when downweighting characters according to their homoplasy but using properly rescaled functions (instead of …,True,_gBx6QMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,408,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x,9943145373666626906,/scholar?cites=9943145373666626906,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1096-0031.2008.00209.x,0,0,0

Cladograms constructed for all of the genera of social Vespidae are optimized for characters associated with social behavior. The character state assignments to the interior nodes are compared with the stages envisioned in the “polygynous family” hypothesis for the evolution of wasp social behavior (West‐Eberhard. 1978). Several of the transitions proposed in the model are consistent with the results: caste formation preceding long‐term monogyny. and long‐term polygyny developing from monogyny. Some transitions do not accord with these results: long‐term polygyny evidently did not evolve directly from a “rudimentary‐caste‐containing” stage. and a stage of tasteless nest sharing may not have occurred.,True,_gBx6QMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,202,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1096-0031.1989.tb00560.x,16081212555990012270,/scholar?cites=16081212555990012270,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1096-0031.1989.tb00560.x,0,0,0

We present the first comprehensive molecular study spanning the entire order Hymenoptera. It is based on approximately 7 kb of DNA sequence from 4 gene regions (18S. 28S. COI and EF-1α) for 116 species representing all superfamilies and 23 outgroup taxa from eight orders of Holometabola. Results are drawn from both parsimony and statistical (Bayesian and likelihood) analyses. and from both by-eye and secondary-structure alignments. Our analyses provide the first firm molecular evidence for monophyly of the Vespina (Orussoidea + Apocrita).

In their paper. as well as in Archie (1989) and Faith (I99 1)~ randomizations of character data are used to specify a decision criterion. It is my purpose here to argue that such applications are ill-conceived. In Faith and Cranston (199 11 and Archie [1989). c aracter states from a given data h matrix are reassigned to taxa under an equiprobable random model. the number and frequency of states being maintained. Cladistic analysis is then performed on the contrived data set. The procedure is repeated a specified number of times (99 or 100. respectively). The frequency of cladograms having a length at least as short as that tbr the real data is treated as the critical value for determining whether the data arc phylogenetically informative. that is. as the level ofsignificance for a Type I error (in this case. incorrect rejection of random congruence). If the conclusion is no difference between lengths for real and contrived data. the cladogram for the real data is regarded as poorly supported.

Consensus trees. which summarize the agreement in grouping among a set of cladograms. are distinguished from compromise trees. which may contain groups that do not appear in all the cladograms being compared. Only a strict or Nelson tree is an actual consensus. This distinction has implications for the concept of support for cladograms: only those branches supported under all possible optimizations are unambiguously supported. We refer to such cladograms as strictly supported. in contrast to the semistrictly (ambiguously) supported cladograms output by various current microcomputer programs for cladistic analysis. Such semistrictly supported cladograms may be collapsed. however. by a variety of options in various programs. Consideration of collapsibility and optimization on multifurcations leads to some conclusions on the use of consensus.

Coalescent-based Poisson-tree-process (PTP) models applied to fast-evolving genes promise one quantitative criterion for recognising species. complete with the estimates of uncertainty that are required of a scientific method. Such methods face challenges especially in discerning between widespread polytypic species and complexes of closely related. restricted-range species. In particular.‘over-sampling’of many closely related individuals within one species could risk causing groups of less closely-related individuals within other species appearing relatively more distinct and consequently could risk them being interpreted falsely as separate species. Some of the most persistent taxonomic problems among bumblebees (genus Bombus Latreille. 1802) are within the subgenus Melanobombus von Dalla Torre. 1880. For a global revision of Melanobombus species. we use COI barcodes and seek to reduce the risk from localised over-sampling by filtering the data to include only unique haplotypes. Unique haplotypes give more conservative results than unfiltered data. but still increase the number of species in comparison with recent morphological treatments. After integrative assessment of COI coalescents in comparison with morphological groups. the number of accepted species shows a non-linear increase with sample size that plateaus to an increase of 47%(to 25 species) compared with a previous estimate (of 17) based on morphology alone.

Analyses of wing shape by the use of principal component analysis (PCA). and canonical variate analysis (CVA) led to a clear differentiation among species. We found a close phenotypic similarity in wing shape between M. albisecta (belonging to the subgenus Creightonella) and M. picicornis (belonging to the subgenus Eutricharaea). According to the results of UPGMA. a higher degree of divergence between M. farinosa (belonging to the subgenus Pseudomegachile) and species belonging to other subgenera. was detected. The results of a cross-validation test indicated that geometric morphometrics is an effective technique to use for distinguishing between Megachile species. The reliability rate of this technique was between 85.71-100%. Using only two submarginal cell landmarks for generating shape variables. the cross-validation test correctly assigned individuals to their respective species. with a 92.85-100% reliability rate.

In addition to genetical characteristics. environmental conditions affect the behavioural traits of honeybee colonies. The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of temperature and humidity on the ability of honeybee workers to remove varroa mites from their body. One hundred worker bees from resistant and susceptible colonies were placed in cages and infested with 40 varroa mites per cage. Cages from each group of workers were randomly assigned to a combination of temperature and humidity treatments. Individual cages were held in incubators at 10. 25 and 34 C under low (20%). medium (50%) and high (80%) humidity. The entire experiment was replicated three times (18 cages per replicate).

At the end of experiment the proportion of mites on the live bees. dead bees and in the equipment was also determined. The results showed significant differences in the ability of the two groups to groom mites off their bodies and that the relative effectiveness of the grooming in the two groups of bees was dependent upon the combination of temperature and humidity to which they were exposed. Total mite mortality of the two groups of bees was also different; however. it was not influenced by temperature.

Import of foreign queens has ceased during the last 10 years.  The objective here was to investigate the present degree of hybridization of the autochthone race Apis mellifera meda.  A total of 12 samples were collected 1995 in the mountainous region of northern Iran (provinces Gilan and Mazandaran).  Other samples (n = 10) came from a breeder (central Iranian province Isfahan) and from a beekeeper with aggressive bees (n = 5).  Twenty bees per sample were measured and analyzed using the method of Kauhausen-Keller und Keller (Apidologie 1994. 25. 133-143).  Samples for comparison (A m meda. A m carnica. A m ligustica. andA m anatolica ) were taken from the data bank in Oberursel.With this method no influence of foreign races on the Iranian population of A m meda could be detected.  There were differences among the central Iranian beekeepers (aggressive and gentle populations). but they could not be linked to an influence ofA m carnica or A m ligustica.  As a result. selection within a race can be a useful alternative to import of foreign races.  Further. the results show a good consistency of the autochthone race. especially under extreme climatic conditions. either by heavy losses during introduction of queens and/or natural selection favouring the adapted genotypes.Bis zu den politischen Veranderungen im Jahre 1979 wurde von der iranischen Imkerschaft eine Vielzahl von Bienenkoniginnen (Midnight und Starline Hybrid-Koniginnen) importiert.

To investigate the genetic make-up of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) in Iran. some research attempts were made during the years 1992-1996 in which the bee's relationship with some exotic races were determined through the application of morphological methods. For this purpose 13000 samples of worker bees from 1320 colonies of 212 apiaries in 104 cities at 25 provinces were taken and twelve morphological characters were measured by using the international method (Ruttner. 1978). Furthermore. seven morphological characters of 900 drone samples taken from 403 colonies of 111 apiaries in 42 cities at 10 provinces were studied through the same method. The principle component analysis (PCA) was used for statistical analysis of the data obtained. The results indicated that the existing populations of honeybees under study were of the Iranian honeybee race (Apis mellifera meda) which were completely distinguishable from those of imported races such as Am carnica. Am ligustica. Am caucasica and exotic races such as Am anatoliaca. Am syriaca; Am yemenitica and Am lamarkii. The imported races had not had great genetic impact on the Iranian race. as the Iranian honeybees have had good consistency and stability.

In most cases. virus contents of individual roots or leaves were not statistically different for barley and wheat. For both plant species. ELISA values peaked sooner in roots than in leaves and in most harvesting dates were higher in roots. The old leaf had a significantly lower virus titre than other leaves. Upper leaves exhibited the highest ELISA values. These results indicate that the upper part of infected plants is the most suitable for virus acquisition by aphids.

Here. we argue that multiple anthropogenic pressures – including land‐use intensification. climate change. and the spread of alien species and diseases – are primarily responsible for insect‐pollinator declines. We show that a complex interplay between pressures (eg lack of food sources. diseases. and pesticides) and biological processes (eg species dispersal and interactions) at a range of scales (from genes to ecosystems) underpins the general decline in insect‐pollinator populations.

It is fundamentally important that the full range of benefits of insect pollination to crop production are understood. if the costs of interventions aiming to enhance pollination are to be compared against the costs of the interventions themselves. Most previous studies have simply assessed the benefits of pollination to crop yield and ignored quality benefits and how these translate through to economic values. In the present study we examine the influence of insect pollination services on farmgate output of two important UK apple varieties; Gala and Cox. Using field experiments. we quantify the influence of insect pollination on yield and importantly quality and whether either may be limited by sub-optimal insect pollination.

Simultaneously. EU agricultural and biofuel policies have encouraged substantial growth in the cultivated area of insect pollinated crops across the continent. Using data from 41 European countries. this study demonstrates that the recommended number of honeybees required to provide crop pollination across Europe has risen 4.9 times as fast as honeybee stocks between 2005 and 2010. Consequently. honeybee stocks were insufficient to supply >90% of demands in 22 countries studied.

While Species Distribution Models (SDM) are the main tool used for these purposes. choosing the best SDM algorithm is not straightforward as these are plentiful and can be applied in many different ways. SDM are used mainly to gain insight in 1) overall species distributions. 2) their past-present-future probability of occurrence and/or 3) to understand their ecological niche limits (also referred to as ecological niche modelling). The fact that these three aims may require different models and outputs is. however. rarely considered and has not been evaluated consistently. Here we use data from a systematically sampled set of species occurrences to specifically test the performance of Species Distribution Models across several commonly used algorithms. Species range in distribution patterns from rare to common and from local to widespread. We compare overall model fit (representing species distribution). the accuracy of the predictions at multiple spatial scales. and the consistency in selection of environmental correlations all across multiple modelling runs. As expected. the choice of modelling algorithm determines model outcome. However. model quality depends not only on the algorithm. but also on the measure of model fit used and the scale at which it is used.

Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees. but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators. or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees. five species of bumblebee. three species of wasp. four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the UK for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses. Ascosphaera fungi. Microsporidia. and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites. encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi. while Microsporidia were rarer. being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia. most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont. and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly. we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris). as well as all honey bees. were positive for deformed wing virus. but that this virus was not present in other pollinators.

Since its introduction. its predation on honeybee colonies has rapidly become an economic problem in invaded countries. Using mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase and 22 nuclear microsatellite loci. we showed that native hornet populations were well differentiated and highly diverse. In contrast. introduced populations from France and Korea suffered a genetic bottleneck. which did not prevent their rapid geographic expansion. Analysis of the genetic data indicates that French and Korean populations likely arose from two independent introduction events. The most probable source population is from an area between the Chinese provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. This invasion route is in agreement with knowledge on trade and historical records.

1176863,Can species distribution models really predict the expansion of invasive species?,2018,Morgane Barbet-Massin and Quentin Rome and Claire Villemant and Franck Courchamp,13,PloS one,3,e0193085,Public Library of Science,Predictive studies are of paramount importance for biological invasions. one of the biggest threats for biodiversity. To help and better prioritize management strategies. species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential invasive range of introduced species. Yet. SDMs have been regularly criticized. due to several strong limitations. such as violating the equilibrium assumption during the invasion process. Unfortunately. validation studies–with independent data–are too scarce to assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in invasion biology. Yet. biological invasions allow to test SDMs usefulness. by retrospectively assessing whether they would have accurately predicted the latest ranges of invasion. Here. we assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in predicting the expansion of invasive species. We used temporal occurrence data for the Asian hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax. a species native to China that is invading Europe with a very fast rate. Specifically. we compared occurrence data from the last stage of invasion (independent validation points) to the climate suitability distribution predicted from models calibrated with data from the early stage of invasion. Despite the invasive species not being at equilibrium yet. the predicted climate suitability of validation points was high. SDMs can thus adequately predict the spread of V. v. nigrithorax. which appears to be—at least partially–climatically driven. In the case of V. v. nigrithorax. SDMs predictive accuracy was slightly but significantly better when models were calibrated with invasive data only. excluding native data.

Our study revealed that nearly 300 species of Hymenoptera belonging to 30 families have been introduced to Europe. In terms of alien species diversity within invertebrate orders. this result ranks Hymenoptera third following Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Two third of alien Hymenoptera are parasitoids or hyperparasitoids that were mostly introduced for biological control purposes. Only 35 phytophagous species. 47 predator species and 3 species of pollinators have been introduced. Six families of wasps (Aphelinidae. Encyrtidae. Eulophidae. Braconidae. Torymidae. Pteromalidae) represent together with ants (Formicidae) about 80% of the alien Hymenoptera introduced to Europe. The three most diverse families are Aphelinidae (60 species representing 32% of the Aphelinid European fauna). Encyrtidae (55) and Formicidae (42) while the Chalcidoidea together represents 2/3 of the total Hymenoptera species introduced to Europe. The first two families are associated with mealybugs. a group that also included numerous aliens to Europe. In addition. they are numerous cases of Hymenoptera introduced from one part of Europe to another. especially from continental Europe to British Islands. These introductions mostly concerned phytophagous or gall-maker species (76 %). less frequently parasitoids.

Vespa velutina nigrithorax. was accidentally introduced from south-east Asia into France before 2004. Being a stinging insect as well as a predator to bees. this species was rapidly noticed by French people and considered a dangerous insect and major threat to beekeeping. However. the number of people that were stung did not increase in the invaded area. Monitoring the invasion through public warnings showed that the alien hornet spread very rapidly over a large part of the country and has now reached northern Spain. Climatic suitability models suggest that this species could spread over a large part of Europe. as well as in other areas of the world. since the scenario of introduction through international trade could well be repeated. The study of the prey spectrum of the hornet. as well as the huge size of its colonies. have led to the fear of potential threats to the native insect biodiversity. notably pollinators. Honeybees are one of the hornets main preys. so it is expected to have an economic impact on beekeeping activities that are already threatened by a wide panel of adversary factors. Nonetheless. the uncontrolled mass trappings and colony destruction performed every year in France. inside and outside the invaded area. might be more deleterious to entomofauna than the pest problem itself.

1176878,Differences in caste dimorphism among three hornet species (Hymenoptera: Vespidae): forewing size. shape and allometry,2012,A Perrard and C Villemant and JM Carpenter and M Baylac,25,Journal of evolutionary biology,7,1389-1398,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Caste shape dimorphism (CShD) has previously been studied in wasps through comparison of different body parts. originating from different imaginal discs. Using geometric morphometrics with a new protocol for measuring wings of pinned specimens from natural history collections. we tested CShD of three hornet species in an organ developed from a single imaginal disc: the forewing. Gaussian mixture models retrieved most castes and species levels. confirming that caste is an important component of wing variations in females of these hornets. Size and allometry – the influence of size on shape – contribution to wing dimorphism between castes was major. but failed to explain the entire shape dimorphism. This deviation from simple allometric scaling was not similar in the three species: in Vespa tropica. allometric directions in the shape space differed between castes. whereas in V. crabro and V. velutina. they …,True,shPmrcUAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,33,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02527.x,4069443116083099499,/scholar?cites=4069443116083099499,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02527.x,0,0,0
1176879,Geographic variation of melanisation patterns in a hornet species: genetic differences. climatic pressures or aposematic constraints?,2014,Adrien Perrard and Mariangela Arca and Quentin Rome and Franck Muller and Jiangli Tan and Sanjaya Bista and Hari Nugroho and Raymond Baudoin and Michel Baylac and Jean-Francois Silvain and James M Carpenter and Claire Villemant,9,PloS one,4,e94162,Public Library of Science,Coloration of stinging insects is often based on contrasted patterns of light and black pigmentations as a warning signal to predators. However. in many social wasp species. geographic variation drastically modifies this signal through melanic polymorphism potentially driven by different selective pressures. To date. surprisingly little is known about the geographic variation of coloration of social wasps in relation to aposematism and melanism and to genetic and developmental constraints. The main objectives of this study are to improve the description of the colour variation within a social wasp species and to determine which factors are driving this variation. Therefore. we explored the evolutionary history of a polymorphic hornet. Vespa velutina Lepeletier. 1836. using mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. and we analysed its melanic variation using a colour space based on a description of body parts coloration. We found two main lineages within the species and confirmed the previous synonymy of V. auraria Smith. 1852. under V. velutina. differing only by the coloration. We also found that the melanic variation of most body parts was positively correlated. with some segments forming potential colour modules. Finally. we showed that the variation of coloration between populations was not related to their molecular. geographic or climatic differences. Our observations suggest that the coloration patterns of hornets and their geographic variations are determined by genes with an influence of developmental constraints. Our results also highlight that Vespa velutina populations have experienced several convergent evolutions of the coloration …,True,shPmrcUAAAAJ:tkaPQYYpVKoC,32,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094162,17649109168538460330,/scholar?cites=17649109168538460330,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094162,0,0,0

This axis of symmetry is created by a developmental organizer that establishes symmetrical patterns of gene expression that in turn pattern the AP axis of the wing. Butterflies possess more typical insect wings and butterfly wing colour patterns provide many landmarks for studies of wing structure and development. Using eyespot colour pattern variation in Vanessa butterflies. here we show an additional AP axis of symmetry running between wing sectors 3 and 4. Boundaries of Drosophila mitotic clones suggest the existence of a previously undetected Far-Posterior (FP) compartment boundary that coincides with this additional AP axis.

While RNA transport proteins such as SID-1 and its orthologues can facilitate dsRNA uptake in some invertebrate species. dsRNA uptake in many insects examined to date appears to be facilitated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). In this study. we used pharmacological inhibitors and RNAi-mediated knockdown of endocytic genes to provide evidence that CME is the primary means of dsRNA uptake in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis was sufficient to supress uptake of short (21 nt) interfering RNAs (siRNAs). short (23 nt) hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). and long (>200 nt) dsRNA molecules in Aedes aegypti …,True,jCdR-6MAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965174820301818,6945900168823408763,/scholar?cites=6945900168823408763,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965174820301818,0,0,0

Although visual analysis of the relative warp analysis plots of the two sexes and also CVA analysis plot indicated correlations between sexes of the same species. differences in the position of the clusters (or species) on the plots suggests that sexual dimorphism in wings is present.

1176922,Colour pattern evolution and development in Vanessa butterflies,2015,Roohollah Abbasi,,,,,John Wiley & Sons Publishers,The evolution and development of eyespot and non-eyespot colour pattern elements was studied in Vanessa butterflies using a phylogenetic approach. A Bayesian phylogeny of the genus Vanessa was reconstructed from 7750 DNA base pairs from 10 genes. Twenty-four non-eyespot and forty-four eyespot color pattern elements from the Nymphalid ground plan were defined and studied and their evolutionary history was traced on the Vanessa phylogeny. Ancestral character states were predicted and the direction of evolutionary changes was inferred for all characters. Five serially arranged eyespots were predicted for the ancestral Vanessa on all wing surfaces. Homologous eyespot and non-eyespot characters on the surfaces of the forewing were more similar than those on the surfaces of the hindwing. Homologous eyespot characters on the dorsal surfaces of fore and hindwings show more similarities than the ventral surfaces. in contrast to what was found for non-eyespot characters. Independent Contrast analysis was also used to study correlations between eyespot characters. Independent Contrast analysis revealed significant correlations between eyespots 2 and 5 and eyespots 3 and 4 on all wing surfaces. This consistency among highly variable eyespot characters suggested a structural hypothesis: the existence of a Far-Posterior (F-P) compartment boundary and organizer could be responsible for the observed correlations. This hypothesis was tested in several ways.  First. examination of wing patterns across species from all families of butterflies revealed correspondence between wing cells 1 and 4 and between cells 2 and 3.

Overgan and Shahr-E-Kord region in Chahar Mahal Va Bakhtiari province in 2000-2002. Pheromone traps were placed in each orchard and male moth trap was recorded weekly. In order to detection pest damage in each orchard 5 tree were selected and with begin fruitlet drop. number of infected and uninfected fruits were counted until harvest time. At harvest time total fruits of each tree were evaluated individually for infection. Studies showed that codling moth overwinters as a mature larva within a cocoon under bark scale and crevices. Pest emergence in walnut orchards usually was simultaneous in apple orchards and sometimes was delayed. The female moths laid their eggs directly on the fruits or sometimes on leaves. Young larvae bore into nutlets through the blossom end and start to feeding. after maturation inside fruits. under bark tree or in soil were pupated. Most nuts with codling moth damage from the overwintered generation drop to the ground. Newly hatched second generation larvae bore into walnuts anywhere on their surfaces but prefer the spot where two nuts touch and feed upon from nut. The larvae leave the nuts when they are fully grown and move to tree trunks or debris to spin cocoons. enter their diapause until next spring. Nuts attacked by larvae from the last part of the first generation and from the second generation remain on the tree but are unmarketable because of the feeding damage to the kernel.

In the present report we present evidence that isolated rodent whiskers have inherent electromagnetic energy which creates electromagnetic fields (EMFs) surrounding the follicle as well as projecting electromagnetic radiations (ER) as rays of light from the follicle which also can be triggered by induced air puffs. mimicking whisking.,True,IOl-4sMAAAAJ:4X0JR2_MtJMC,12,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12416844552641043901&hl=en&oi=scholarr,12416844552641043901,/scholar?cites=12416844552641043901,,,0,0,0

Therefore. data on the ecological factors affecting mosquito density and abundance especially the physicochemical properties of water of their breeding sites. can possibly be helpful in implementing larval management programs. Mosquito larvae were collected using a standard 350 ml dipper from fixed habitats including: artificial pool. river edge. creek and etc. in 30 villages of 16 counties from May-December 2014. Water samples were collected during larval collection and temperature (°C). acidity (pH). turbidity (NTU). electrical conductivity (μS/cm). alkalinity (mg/l CaCO3). total hardness (mg/l). nitrate (mg/l). chloride (mg/l). phosphate (mg/l) and sulphate (mg/l) were measured using standard methods. Spearman correlation coefficient. Kruskal-Wallis test of nonparametric analysis. Chi-square (χ2) analysis. regression analysis and C8 interspecific correlation coefficient were used for data analysis. A total of 7.566 mosquito larvae belonging to 15 species representing three genera were collected from fixed larval breeding places. Culex pipiens was the dominant species except in four villages where An. maculipennis s.l. and Cx. torrentium were predominant.

Although an association of adult flies with decomposing human and animal bodies is documented for about 200 taxa worldwide. cadavers and carrion represents a breeding habitat for considerably fewer species. Species that do colonize dead human bodies can do so under diverse environmental conditions and. under certain circumstances. Muscidae may be the only colonizers of a body. Because of difficulties in identification. many studies have identified immature and/or adult muscids only to the genus or family level.

These estimates are usually based on the age of larval or pupal specimens. However. the age defines only the minimum PMI. In order to move forensic entomology further. a method useful for the estimation of an interval preceding insect appearance on a corpse called the pre-appearance interval (PAI) is needed. Recently. it was demonstrated that the PAI of several carrion beetles is closely related to the temperature prevailing throughout this interval. Hence. it was postulated to estimate PAI from temperature. In order to check premises for using this approach with flies. a test of the relationship between adult or oviposition PAI and temperature was made for nine species of European flies. Data on PAI originated from pig carcasses decomposing under various temperatures. Adult PAI of Hydrotaea dentipes. Hydrotaea ignava.

The larvae of species of this genus feed on highly decomposed organic matter of various origins. and may reveal predatory behaviour as they mature. These feeding habits. combined with the widespread distribution and close association with human dwellings of some species. give the genus commercial and medico‐legal importance. However. the systematic position of Ophyra has been a matter of debate for many years. Ophyra has been considered by muscid workers to be either a valid genus or a junior synonym of Hydrotaea Robineau‐Desvoidy.

Neohydrotaea lundbecki (Michelsen) is a muscid species considered rare as known only from four specimens reported so far from Denmark and Great Britain. Five females of the species were collected during a surveillance study of necrophagous insects active in flight in June 2009 and June 2010 in Germany. It is the first record of N. lundbecki from Germany and the first report since the last documented finding of the species in 1968.

Infestations are often highly pathogenic. leading to host mortality or reductions in growth (Skidmore 1985; Poiani 1993). Associations between this generalist obligate parasite and several avian hosts have been documented (Pont 1974). but we report the first case from a captive-bred introduced species. the common pigeon. Columba livia domestica Gmelin. Incomplete larval taxonomy make the identification of Passeromyia Rodhain and Villeneuve challenging as current morphological descriptions (Skidmore 1985) do not allow for unequivocal species discrimination. The use of DNA barcoding provides an alternative diagnostic tool in the absence of a morphological-based approach and when rearing larvae is not feasible. In mid spring 2015. myiasis in a two-day old. captivebred pigeon squab was reported from a property in the dry tropics region of Bluewater. Queensland (19 09’37.7” S 146 33’57.7” E).

However.Drosophila homozygous for null mutations of anNF1 homolog showed no obvious signs of perturbed Ras1-mediated signaling. Loss of NF1 resulted in a reduction in size of larvae. pupae. and adults. This size defect was not modified by manipulating Ras1 signaling but was restored by expression of activated adenosine 3′.5′-monophosphate–dependent protein kinase (PKA). Thus.

Ltd,The rap genes. which encode low-molecular-weight GTPases are highly conserved among different organisms and have been characterized in a number of diverse species including Dictyostelium (Robbins et al.. 1991). Drosophila (Neuman-Silberberg et al.. 1984; Hariharan et al.. 1991) and humans (Pizon et al.. 1988; Kitayama et al.. 1989). Rap proteins exhibit~ 50% sequence similarity to Ras proteins at the amino acid level. More significantly. the domain in Ras proteins that interacts with effectors is highly conserved in the Rap proteins. This suggests that Rap proteins could potentially interact with Ras effectors and may thus modulate Ras-mediated signaling pathways that have been shown to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.

In mammals. the regenerative capacity of most of the adult nervous system is extremely limited. possibly because of the absence of neural stem cells. Here we show that the absence of adult neurogenesis in Drosophila results from the elimination of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) during development. Prior to their elimination. their growth and proliferation slows because of decreased insulin/PI3 kinase signaling. resulting in nuclear localization of Foxo. These small neuroblasts are typically eliminated by caspase-dependent cell death. and not exclusively by terminal differentiation as has been proposed [4].

The vast majority of cells express activation antigens. whereas the plasma cell antigen PC1 is present on only a few cells. Staining for this antigen doubles with staining for EB viral capsid antigen. Thus it marks cells in the virus replicative cycle. and these cells are negative for the EB virus nuclear antigen EBNA. We suggest that within EB virus genome-carrying B-cell lines the maturation of a few cells to the stage of expression of plasma-cell markers leads to the loss of EBNA expression and consequent loss of the immortalized state of the cell.

In Drosophila melanogaster larvae. immune-inducible lamellocytes participate in recognizing and killing parasitoid wasp eggs. However. the sequence of events required for lamellocyte generation remains controversial. To study the cellular immune system. we developed a flow cytometry approach using in vivo reporters for lamellocytes as well as for plasmatocytes. the main hemocyte type in healthy larvae. We found that two different blood cell lineages. the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte lineages. contribute to the generation of lamellocytes in a demand-adapted hematopoietic process. Plasmatocytes transdifferentiate into lamellocyte-like cells in situ directly on the wasp egg. In parallel. a novel population of infection-induced cells. which we named lamelloblasts. appears in the circulation. Lamelloblasts proliferate vigorously and develop into the major class of circulating lamellocytes. Our data indicate that lamellocyte differentiation upon wasp parasitism is a plastic and dynamic process.

In Drosophila. the two known Frizzled proteins are associated with distinct developmental processes. Genesis of epithelial planar polarity requires Frizzled. whereas Dfz2 affects morphogenesis by wingless-mediated signaling. Dishevelled is required in both signaling pathways. Here. we use genetic and overexpression assays to show that Dishevelled activates JNK cascades. Rescue analysis reveals different protein domain requirements in Dishevelled for the two pathways; the C-terminal DEP domain is essential to rescue planar polarity defects and induce JNK signaling. Furthermore. the planar polarity–specific dsh1 allele is mutated in the DEP domain.

Overexpression of Xstbm. which is expressed broadly in early development and subsequently in the nervous system. causes severely shortened trunk structures; a similar phenotype results from inhibiting Xstbm translation using a morpholino antisense oligo. Experiments with Keller explants further demonstrate that Xstbm can regulate convergent extension in both dorsal mesoderm and neural tissue. The specification of dorsal tissues is not affected.

Total phenolic compound levels exhibited specific responses to a particular abiotic stress factor that responded rapidly to drought exposure. light intensity. and with a slight change in response to salt stress and heat stress. A parallel change was found in an elevation in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents. Change in anthocyanin and carotenoid contents in response to drought. different light intensities. salinity and temperature stress was encountered with a change in H2O2. A change in the malondialdehyde level was also exhibited. depending on the levels of oxidant and antioxidant availability during particular abiotic stress factors. This risk was accomplished by the regulation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase activity. Prolonged exposure showed a reduction in chlorophyll content. Higher anthocyanin. carotenoid. H2O2 and total phenolic compound levels were expressed in the plasticity of plant acclimation at different levels. The tolerance of abiotic stress factors is apparently closely associated with the non-enzymatic antioxidant system via metabolome readjustment.

Therefore. the present research was carried out to investigate the effects of exogenous application of PGRson seed germination. protein content and?-galactosidase activity of L. sativum. Germination of L. sativum seeds was monitored for a short interval after the start of incubation until growth became 100%. While cytokinin treatment showed a positive effect on seed germination more than Gibberellic acid (GA). salicylic acid (SA) produced a higher negative effect than auxins. Quantifying changes in total protein content during seed germination as influenced by PGRs revealed that all PGRs have to exert a positive effect arranged in the following order: SA? auxin? cytokinin? GA. Parallel to changes in germination percentage and total protein content of seed. a negative effect was attainedon?-galactosidase specific activity in response to PGRs with the following arrangement: SA? auxin? cytokinin?

Eruca sativa is known as a garden plant used in folk medicine to enhance the sexual desire in males. Nevertheless. the interaction of Sildenafil and Eruca sativa was not studied. In the current study. we aimed to examine the influence of Eruca sativa on Sildenafil pharmacokinetics in rats. STUDY DESIGN: A crossover experiment with washout period of two weeks was conducted. To one group of animals. Eruca sativa was given as food and a drinking solution to rats for 12 hours before the day of the experiment. On the day of the experiment. the same group received 5 ml (50 mg/ml) orally and a half an hour later animals received 1 ml Sildenafil citrate (2.85 mg/kg) oral administrated to the study group. The other group of rats only received Sildenafil. Two-weeks later a cross-over design on the same animals was conducted. Blood samples were collected from optical vein on different time intervals. samples were analyzed using validated (HPLC-UV) method.RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Pre-administration of Eruca sativa has increased Sildenafil Cmax from 226.72 to 345.25 ng/ml.(p< 0.05). In addition. the AUC of Sildenafil has significantly increased when it was pre-administered with Eruca sativa (550.59 vs. 916.48 ng/ml* hr).

In order to identify the common mutations among CF Jordanian patients a total of 386 Jordanian CF patients (323 families) were followed up over a period of fifteen years from diagnosis and were screened for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutations. Furthermore. to characterize the spectrum of the CFTR mutations. DNA samples were obtained from sixty-eight patients and sixty-six parents and were subjected to complete CFTR gene screening by multiplex heteroduplex (mHET) analysis followed by direct sequencing. The screening included promoter. all exons with flanking intron sequence (including T-tract in intron 8) and resulted in the identification of twentysix different mutations. The most prevalent mutation. p. Phe508del was found to account only for 7.4% of the identified CFTR mutations. This low frequency of the p. Phe508del mutation among Jordanian patients is comparable with native Asians. In this study. seven CFTR mutations. which have not been previously reported. were identified (c.

Therefore. irregularity in magnesium status-mainly hypomagnesaemia as it is seen more often than hypomagnesaemia—might result in unwanted neuromuscular. cardiac or nervous disorders. Measuring total serum magnesium is a practical and affordable way to monitor changes in magnesium status. although it does not necessarily reflect total body magnesium content. To date. no group has evaluated magnesium as a cardiovascular risk factor in Jordanian population. Thus. a simple colometric method (Xylidyl blue method). was used to determine the magnesium serum levels in a population of healthy and patients from Jordan Hospital. 151 subjects were enrolled in this study (101 healthy and 50 patients). There was a decrease but non-significant (p> 0.05) in Mg levels in patients samples compared to that of healthy (2.01±0.28 vs. 2.04±0.18. respectively).

We found a putative p53-binding site. which specifically responded to p53. in the second intron of the E2FBP1/DRIL1 gene. E2FBP1/DRIL1was induced by p53 and up-regulated following DNA damage caused by UV radiation or doxorubicin treatment in a manner dependent on endogenous p53. The ectopic expression of E2FBP1/DRIL1 induced growth arrest in U2OS cells expressing normal p53. but not Saos-2 cells lacking p53.

Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46 (p53Ser46) is considered to be a crucial modification regulating p53-mediated apoptosis. Because the activity of p53 is impaired in most human cancers. restoration of wild-type p53 (wt-p53) function by its gene transfer or by p53-reactivating small molecules has been extensively investigated. The p53-reactivating compounds Nutlin-3 and RITA activate p53 in the absence of genotoxic stress by antagonizing the action of its negative regulator Mdm2. Although controversial.

Vitamin B12 deficiency has been linked to hematological. neuropsychiatric and metabolic disturbances. The role of vitamin B12 deficiency on lipid per oxidation has not been thoroughly explored. Therefore. the aim of this study was to assess the impact of vitamin B12 deficiency on the levels of lipid per oxidation marker Malondialdehyde and serum total antioxidant capacity in patients with symptoms and signs of B12 deficiency.Methods: Serum levels of vitamin B12. malondialdehyde as a marker for lipid per oxidation and total antioxidant capacity were determined in blood samples taken from twenty five patients admitted to outpatient clinics. All patients had vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms and serologically confirmed to have low≤ 200 Pg./ml or borderline 201-300 Pg./ml levels. None of the patients was diabetic or vegetarian.Results: Serum levels of vitamin B12 for the studied patients were ranged between 57 and 291 pg./ml. A significant inverse correlation was observed between lipid per oxidation profile measured as malondialdehyde and serum B12 levels. The relationship between serum total antioxidant capacity levels and vitamin B12 levels was significantly positive linear in both males and females subjects.Conclusion: Serum total antioxidant capacity was significantly decreased with lowering serum B12 level.

A short-term solution for this problem is captive breeding and artificial rearing. This experiment aimed at looking for a source of good sperm donors for in-vitro fertilization and captive breeding. Tachypleus gigas were collected from Balok Beach. Kuantan. Pahang. Malaysia. Crabs were divided to wild and captive groups. Wild T. gigas sperm was collected on the same day. while sperm of captive T. gigas was collected after 5 months of captivity to assess captivity effect on sperm traits. Sperm density and sperm viability were studied and correlated to morphometric measurements. The results indicated that T. gigas from Balok is a good sperm donor. Captivity was found to affect sperm traits where sperm density dropped significantly and sperm viability increased slightly. Intraocular width to carapace width ratio (IO-Car) of the HSC body correlated to sperm density. hence can be used as an indicator for donor selection during sampling. In conclusion.

Marine organisms are known to produce metabolites to protect themselves against pathogens and therefore can be considered as a potential source of antimicrobial substances. This study designed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of three hard coral species namely Favites sp Link (Faviidae). Galaxea fascicularis Linnaeus (Oculinidae). and Galaxea astreata Lamarck (Oculinidae) against six pathogenic microbes. The coral species were extracted with water and a combination of dichloromethane and methanol. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was evaluated using disc diffusion method and microdilution method. From the disc diffusion method. the organic extracts showed antimicrobial activity while the aqueous extracts showed no activity. The organic extract from G. fascicularis was the most effective against Staphylococcus aureus (11 mm) and Bacillus cereus (10.5 mm). From the microdilution method. the organic extracts of G. fascicularis and G. astreata showed inhibitory effect against S. aureus and B. cereus at low concentrations (0.003-0.1 mg/mL). However. complete growth inhibitions of S. aureus and B. cereus were observed for the organic extract of G. fascicularis at concentrations of 0.34 and 1.1 mg/mL. respectively.

1177616,Effect of prolonged captivity on the hemolymph profile of Tachypleus gigas,2020,Akbar John and Hassan Ibrahim Sheikh and Solachuddin JA Ichwan and Kamaruzzaaman Bin Yunus,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Horseshoe crabs amebocyte cells degranulate to form a gel clot when in contact with endotoxins. This phenomenon is the basis of both Horseshoe crab immune system and detection of endotoxin in biologicals. The present study investigates the amebocyte cells quality in Tachypleus gigas pre and post bleeding under captivity. Wild and captive horseshoe crabs (5 months captivity) were bled in 6 anticoagulant formulations (A. B. C. D. E and F). No profound difference in cell density between captive and wild groups with the mean value of 8.83 million cells/mL and 9.17 million cells/mL. respectively. while. the cell viability of the captive group was significantly lower than the wild crabs (F=808.075. p<0.001). Anticoagulant formulation significantly affected cell viability and cell morphology in both captive and wild groups (p<0.001). Amebocyte cells collected from the wild T. gigas using optimum anticoagulant (formula C) showed 6 million cells/mL cell density and 86.9% cell viability. while morphology analysis revealed the percentage of contracted. granular flattened and degranulated flattened cells were 14.62%. 71.39% and 14%. respectively. The anticoagulant formulations showed varying capabilities in maintaining cell viability due to its buffering and chelating capacity. We conclude that captivity has a negative effect on the amebocyte cell quality.,True,18_i5_gAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.059816v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/04/25/2020.04.24.059816.full.pdf,0,0,0
1177617,Ethical Issues on using Invertebrates in Environmental and Biomedical Practices–A Case Study on Living Fossil Horseshoe Crab,2018,Hassan I Sheikh and Ibrahim Shogar and AH Abdurrezak and BY Kamaruzzaman and KCA Jalal and Ailin Razali,17,IIUM Medical Journal Malaysia,2,,,Increasing utilization of living animals in ecological and biomedical research has drawn serious concerns in terms of animal welfare and ethical practices in animal handling. Significant attention has been given to animals of higher taxonomical hierarchy especially vertebrates such as fishes. rodents. reptiles and mammals. while ethical framework on invertebrate handling and welfare is less addressed (except for cephalopods). The definition of ‘Animal’itself by any international consortia or Animal Research Act (ARA) does not include invertebrates as an animal entity. This is due to the lack of standard ethical framework to understand the pain and other physiological stress experienced by the invertebrate test animal. One such example would be the living fossil ‘horseshoe crab’which is extensively bled to obtain its blue blood that is used for endotoxin quantification in biological samples. The biomedical bleeding itself leads to 15-30% post bleeding mortality of crabs. while pain and stress caused by the bleeding practice is not studied. Hence. this paper discusses the technicality of establishing standard framework for invertebrate handling. The paper also highlights the shari’ah (Islamic law) principles on scientific experimentations on animal subjects. particularly the norms related to the adoption of invertebrates in environmental and biomedical practice. Comprehensive review of ethical regulations in animal experiments. especially invertebrates. would be beneficial for revising and improving existing animal ethical practices.,True,18_i5_gAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,0,https://journals.iium.edu.my/kom/index.php/imjm/article/view/950,,,,https://journals.iium.edu.my/kom/index.php/imjm/article/download/950/646,0,0,0

1177619,Captive breeding and rearing of Tachypleus gigas for its biomedical utilization and conservation,2018,Hassan Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,,,,,Kuantan: International Islamic University Malaysia. 2018,Horseshoe crab (HSC) has been exploited by several industries such as agriculture (fertilizer) and as livestock feed. yet. the bigger threats come from fisheries. biomedical industries and habitat destruction. Hence. this present study aimed at investigating various biological parameters. artificial breeding and rearing conditions to be used for horseshoe crab’s conservation. The first stage of this study was aimed at studying the effect of captivity on hemolymph quality for the purpose of LAL production. and sperm traits of T. gigas for captive spawning and rearing studies. The second stage of this study focused on captive spawning and rearing of T. gigas for the restocking/repopulation purpose. The third stage aimed at identifying pathogens that caused mortality during captive breeding and rearing studies. Effect of captivity was assessed in wild and captive horseshoe crabs (5 month captivity) collected from Balok beach. Kuantan. Pahang. The blood was collected in 6 different anticoagulant formulations (A. B. C. D. E and F) and amoebocyte cells’ density. viability and morphology were investigated. While the sperm was collected from wild and captive horseshoe crabs by massaging the gonads and sperm density and viability were studied. Optimum captive spawning and rearing of T. gigas conditions were then investigated. Importance and type of sand substrates (no substrate. coarse sand and fine sand) as well as the addition of fish oil (CLO) to T. gigas’s feed were studied to improve captive spawning. While differential microalgae feeds (Isochrysis. Spirulina and Isochrysis +Spirulina) were studied to induce molting and improve survival of T. gigas …,True,18_i5_gAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,0,http://210.48.222.250/handle/123456789/6056,,,,http://210.48.222.250/bitstream/123456789/6056/1/t11100396719HassanIbrahim_SEC_24.pdf,0,0,0
