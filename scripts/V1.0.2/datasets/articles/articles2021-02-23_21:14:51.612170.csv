1093739,Caracterización de familias recompuestas canguro: reacción ante embarazo. apoyo social y estrés,,Cristina Restrepo Jimeno,,,,,Pontificia Universidad Javeriana,La presente investigación es una sistematización de la práctica Familia. vínculos y violencia. tuvo como objetivo principal caracterizar las percepciones maternas de mujeres que hacen parte de una familia recompuesta con un bebé prematuro. pertenecientes al Programa Madre Canguro Integral (PMCI). teniendo en cuenta la reacción ante la noticia del embarazo. la red de apoyo y el estrés. Se empleó una investigación mixta. a través de la cual se aplicaron 40 entrevistas semiestructuradas a las madres. y la escala de estrés parental (EEP) validada en español. Los datos se interpretaron por medio de la teoría fundamentada y la codificación abierta. Se encontró una tendencia de las madres de familias recompuestas con bebés prematuros a presentar menores niveles de estrés cuando tienen mayor apoyo social. pues. además. la aceptación del embarazo puede incidir en el aumento del estrés. Es por esto por lo que las madres separadas con hijos tienden a buscar una pareja que les otorgue seguridad. compañía. apoyo y sustento económico. Asimismo. el deseo de tener hijos en esta nueva unión está fuertemente determinado por el ideal que comparten de constituir un hogar de tipo nuclear o parecido al mismo y por el apoyo que las mujeres consideran que recibirán de su pareja cuando lo tengan. De igual forma. los padres de dichas familias tienden a estimular la negociación entre los excónyuges y sus nuevos conyugues promoviendo el coparentado y la cocrianza y fomentando el apoyo hacia las madres y. por ende. el adecuado desarrollo de sus hijos.,True,S1z6ur8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://repository.javeriana.edu.co/handle/10554/35110,,,,"https://repository.javeriana.edu.co/bitstream/handle/10554/35110/Caracterizaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Familias%20Recompuestas%20Canguro%20Reacci%C3%B3n%20ante%20Embarazo,%20Apoyo%20Social%20y%20Estr%C3%A9s.pdf?sequence=2",0,0,0

1093755,Research on Sleep Bruxism,,Joshua Kiprono Rotich,,,,,,Bruxism is an oral motor condition that occurs during sleep or when awake. The definition of bruxism in terms of its occurrence in sleep or when one is awake is attributed to the International Consensus on the Assessment of Bruxism (Lobbezoo et al.. 2018). Sleep bruxism can be defined as the activity of the masticatory muscles of someone sleeping; which is characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic) but not as asleep or movement disorder in otherwise healthy individuals (Klasser. Rei. and Lavigne. 2015). While sleep bruxism involves the involuntary movement of masticatory muscles resulting in teeth contact. awake bruxism is characterized by jaw clenching. Usually. it causes a grinding or tapping noise. The study of bruxism has intensified over the years due to the great interest it has elicited among neurological. dental and sleep researchers. It was not until 2018 that the disease was considered a disorder during the International Consensus on the Assessment of Bruxism (Lobbezoo et al.. 2018).,True,Wed1-MUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua-Rotich/publication/336409440_Research_on_Sleep_Bruxism/links/5d9f988ca6fdcc8fc346ce5c/Research-on-Sleep-Bruxism.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua-Rotich/publication/336409440_Research_on_Sleep_Bruxism/links/5d9f988ca6fdcc8fc346ce5c/Research-on-Sleep-Bruxism.pdf,0,0,0

Ametryn commonly used to control weeds in the paddy field. The effect of ametryn on fish especially Monopterus albus was unknown. This study aims to determine the acute toxicity of ametryn and its effects on the behaviour of the eels. The adult M. albus were exposed to 0. 0.75. 1.5 and 3.0 mg/L of ametryn for 96 hours under laboratory conditions. The eels showed symptoms of abnormal behaviour responses during the exposure which are agitated behaviour. respiratory distress. and abnormal nervous behaviour. Mortality was increased by increasing the concentration of ametryn. This present study showed the effect of ametryn on kidney tissue changes. Hemorrhage and distribution of hemosiderin. hydropic degeneration. granular degeneration. tubular necrosis. narrowing tubular lumen and necrosis were major histopathological effects that occurred during the exposure to ametryn. In conclusion. ametryn is very sensitive to Monopterus albus.

1093771,Effects of temperature on enzyme activity of aquatic litter-associated fungi,2019,Nicholas Bautz,,,,,,The decomposition of leaf litter in aquatic ecosystems is carried out mostly by microorganisms. including bacteria and fungi. Fungi. known as aquatic hyphomycetes. dominate microbial communities in the decomposition of leaf litter. These fungi produce extracellular enzymes that aid in the sequestration of carbon and nutrients and lead to the breakdown of complex plant polymers. We evaluated the effects of temperature on extracellular enzyme activity within the framework of the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE). The activity of β-1. 4-glucosidase and β-1. 4-xylosidase was estimated fluorometrically using artificial substrate analogs. Phenol oxidase activity was estimated spectrophotometrically from oxidation of L-DOPA (L-3. 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). We found greater temperature sensitivity of oxidative enzymes (phenol oxidase) involved in degradation of recalcitrant substrates compared to hydrolytic enzymes (β-glucosidase and β-xylosidase). In addition. we found that the activity of microbial enzymes involved in carbon sequestration does not follow simple monotonous response across experimental temperatures (4-20 C) predicted by the MTE. Instead. we observed greater temperature sensitivity (higher apparent activation energy) of hydrolytic enzymes at colder temperatures. These findings may have important implications for stream ecosystems under climate change scenarios since both peak leaf litter availability and microbial activity occur during the coldest seasons in autumn-winter.,True,c14z5TMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://digitalcommons.coastal.edu/honors-theses/360/,,,,https://digitalcommons.coastal.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1361&context=honors-theses,0,0,0

Amazingly. parasitic and non-parasitic nematodes have nearly identical pathways for developing the stress-resistant. dauer or infective. dispersal stages of their life cycles. One of the key divergent traits seen between infective and free-living is host specificity. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is promiscuous in it choice of transportation vector. Caenorhabditis species 34. a close relative of C. elegans. may represent a divergent phenotypic group of free-living worms with only one animal transportation vector. Using SDS to isolate dauers. C. elegans and C. briggsae were found to have higher dauer formation than C. sp. 34. When SDS was performed on 29 wild isolates of C. sp. 34. dauer frequency was again found to be lower than the other species. but variation in propensity to make dauers was seen in C. sp. 34. The C. sp. 34 dauer is significantly smaller than any other dauer measured and lacks the typical radial constriction found in dauers. However. it retains the classic dauer characteristic of pharyngeal constriction. Its unique dauer morphotype may be explained by the small size of its symbiotic partner. Ceratosolen. Additionally. conventional RNAi techniques using feeding to target dauer arrest genes failed to produce high amounts of dauers. but controls question the interoperability of the results.

Mexico to northern Peru. including several oceanic islands. The ETP is a natural laboratory. a model for understanding the development of coral biotopes in a changing environment. We evaluate conservation strategies in seven countries in the ETP region (Peru was not included for apparent lack of coral habitats). A survey of current Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) highlights great variation in the number. scale and management approaches. Generally. MPAs with no-take areas are relatively uncommon. with multi-purpose areas favored. The Cabo Pulmo MPA in Baja California. Mexico demonstrates that when a local community is involved in the creation and enforcement measures of an MPA. conservation success can be achieved. Despite such apparent successes. inadequate and confusing legal practices have generally forestalled effective protection of coral ecosystems in the ETP. However. in several instances nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have assisted with planning. negotiation and stakeholder engagement. Nonetheless these findings underscore how the establishment of an MPA does not guarantee that conservation goals will be achieved. This calls for a new approach that incorporates contributions from ecological studies along with a high investment in capacity development and training to ensure that the goals of MPAs better complement effective fisheries and ecosystem management within and outside their …,True,vufUBIYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,http://www.kerwa.ucr.ac.cr/handle/10669/78485,,,,,0,0,0

La trucha arcoíris (Oncorhynchus mykiss) pertenece al grupo de peces Salmónidos. esta especie se la ha introducido a nivel global. lo que los convierte en un taxón ideal para estudios de invasión. En este estudio se realizó un muestreo a lo largo de un gradiente glaciar en diez estaciones (secciones de 25 m del río) de la Reserva Ecológica Antisana. En cada estación se determinó las características físico químicas e hidromorfológicas de cada río. posteriormente se recolectaron muestras de macroinvertebrados (Muestreo Surber) para así determinar su influencia en la abundancia y distribución de truchas. y finalmente mediante pesca eléctrica se realizó el muestreo de truchas. Los resultados mostraron que los taxones más predominantes en la dieta (análisis de contenidos estomacales) de las truchas fueron Andesiops sp. (Baetidae). Hyallela sp.

In recent years. the walleye population has been in decline to the point of a walleye sport-fishery moratorium issued in 2016. There are likely multiple factors contributing to this decline. but given the major data gaps in our understanding of Lake Scugog’s health. this OTF Grow-Grant project focused on collecting water quality and habitat condition data at sites near current and past walleye spawning grounds. Although an array of water quality and biological data was collected. we were particularly interested in the role that nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen). water clarity. temperature. and oxygen conditions had on aquatic weed beds and macroinvertebrate communities.Over the course of the study. there was a notable shift from native macroinvertebrate and macrophyte species to invasive species. Specifically. there was an increase in the non-native mollusk Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and the non-native macrophyte Nitellopsis obtusa (Starry Stonewort). The historically dominant invasive aquatic plant Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian Watermilfoil) was replaced by the invasive macrophyte Starry Stonewort over the course of the study. Interestingly. Eurasian Watermilfoil was found to be associated with a more diverse macrophyte community. whereas Starry Stonewort had a negative relationship with macrophyte community richness (ie. number of species).

1093810,RETRACTION: Numerical simulation on pollutant dispersion from vehicle exhaust in street configurations,2009,Mohamed F Yassin and R Kellnerová and Z Jaňour,,,,,,The impact of the street configurations on pollutants dispersion from vehicles exhausts within urban canyons was numerically investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Three-dimensional flow and dispersion of gaseous pollutants were modeled using standard κ − ε turbulence model. which was numerically solved based on Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations by the commercial CFD code FLUENT. The concentration fields in the urban canyons were examined in three cases of street configurations: (1) a regular-shaped intersection. (2) a T-shaped intersection and (3) a Skew-shaped crossing intersection. Vehicle emissions were simulated as double line sources along the street. The numerical model was validated against wind tunnel results in order to optimize the turbulence model. Numerical predictions agreed reasonably well with wind tunnel results. The results obtained indicate that the mean horizontal velocity was very small in the center near the lower region of street canyon. The lowest turbulent kinetic energy was found at the separation and reattachment points associated with the corner of the down part of the upwind and downwind buildings in the street canyon. The pollutant concentration at the upwind side in the regular-shaped street intersection was higher than that in the T-shaped and Skew-shaped street intersections. Moreover. the results reveal that the street intersections are important factors to predict the flow patterns and pollutant dispersion in street canyon.,True,yCWsg4cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/560778,,,,,0,0,0
1093811,Igf2 Gene Expression Levels in Wild-Type and Mutant Mice,2017,Giang Van Tran and Dung Quoc Tran and Pham Thanh and Nguyen Ty and Pham Quang Chinh,2,Open Science Journal,4,,,Genomic imprinting occurs where only one allele of a gene is expressed depending on its parental origin. The imprinted Igf2 gene (Insulin-like growth factor 2) is encoding a growth factor. which play an important role in embryonic development and formation of the placenta. The regulation and expression of Igf2 is carried out by different promoters. Promoter expression is extremely complex in wild-type mice during development and is altered in several mutant mice bearing deletions at the Igf2/H19 locus. In this work. we analyzed the Igf2 RNA expression of the placenta-specific P0 promoter in placental tissue (embryonic day 17) of both wild-type and mutant mice. For all the other promoters. we used RNA extracted from liver tissues (postnatal day 7.5). All these RNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNA before quantifying expression levels of the promoters by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Our results show that transcriptions of Igf2 P2 and P3 promoters are the highest in all mice analyzed. except in ΔU2/Dom mutant mice where P0 and P1 promoters were highly expressed. while they display low expression in all the other mice strains analyzed. Furthermore. all promoters were stably expressed at high levels in wild-type and ΔU2/Dom mutation. but at a low level in Δ3/Dom,True,ubvkr54AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://osjournal.org/ojs/index.php/OSJ/article/view/1268,,,,https://osjournal.org/ojs/index.php/OSJ/article/download/1268/95,0,0,0

Their nocturnal behavior. quick movements. and small size make them difficult to study. Audio recording is among the most effective ways to study bat populations. as the echolocation they use to find and capture prey can be recorded using high-frequency recording devices without the need to capture individuals. This study analyzed the patterns of bat foraging populations around the SUNY Geneseo campus from early June until late September with high-frequency audio recording to estimate the number of bats in different areas around campus. These recordings were analyzed with respect to environmental conditions. namely temperature. humidity. as well as time of year. As identified in a previous study. the most prevalent species on campus are the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). and the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Our analysis suggests. seasonal variation had a much greater effect on foraging behavior than other environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.,True,pjKK51AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://knightscholar.geneseo.edu/great-day-symposium/great-day-2020/posters-2020/88/,,,,,0,0,0

The goal of this experiment was to analyze the effect of the Dpy mutation on osmoregulation by comparing the survivorship rates of N2 and Dpy strains of C. elegans when placed in a hypertonic environment. EMS mutagenesis was used to isolate populations of Dpy mutants. which were then exposed to .05 M. 0.1M. 0.25 M. 0.5 M. and 1.0 M NaCl for a 30 minute period. A survivorship assay was then conducted and results were compared to wild type survivorship within the different molarities. Dpy mutants were found to have consistently higher average rates of survival in higher molarity(>0.05M) solutions with a maximum difference of 4.2x in 0.5M. Further experimentation with this mutant can provide a molecular explanation of why the Dpy strain is able to resist more osmotic stress than N2 worms.,True,Zl1GiOkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://baylor-ir.tdl.org/handle/2104/10820,,,,https://baylor-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2104/10820/cuticle.ramani.pdf?sequence=4,0,0,0

1093870,BS BIOLOGY April 2019,,Beverly M Cagod and Lucien Guerra and Jet Almocera and Ralston Ende and James Ivan Baluran and Mara Louisa C Navarez,,,,,,Pregnant women often create their own way of imaginary representation of a baby. Generating an emotional bond between the mother and the child is a process that evolves during pregnancy and is continued after the delivery. Women who treat their babies as individuals attribute certain characteristics and qualities to them (Popławska. 2011). As the whole population. the perception is that the sex of the infant is a matter of chance depending on whether an X or a Y-chromosome bearing spermatozoon fertilizes the ovum. Sex is a biological categorization based primarily on reproductive potential. whereas gender is the social elaboration of biological sex. Not surprisingly. social norms for heterosexual coupling and care of any resulting children are closely intertwined with gender. But that is far from the full story. Gender builds on biological sex. but it exaggerates biological difference. and it carries biological difference into domains in which it is completely irrelevant (Eckert. 2011).Benoit et al.. 1997 while evaluating maternal representations of a baby in the third trimester of pregnancy. attempted to predict the quality of mother’s attachment to her baby in its twelfth month of life. Study results revealed that psychological life of the pregnant woman essentially affects baby’s attachment to its mother.

1093879,The alteration of PGC-1α expression in younger non-professional athletes with acute medium intensity exercise model,2020,Jerry Dwi Trijoyo Purnomo and Melati Putri Pertiwi and Elhah Nailul Khasna and I Kade Karisma Gita Ardana,,,,,,Metabolic syndrome and physical activity entail a significant correlation to the gradual augmentation of degenerative disease incidence in the global population. Currently. several approaches have been applied to prevent the progression of metabolic syndrome. including clinical drug therapy and physical training program. However. little attention has been addressed to investigate whether acute medium intensity exercise (AMIE) co-treated with middle rhythm musical exposure can affect to thermogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. To fill this void. this present study was designed by applying AMIE and music on 45 individuals. non-professional athletes to evaluate the potential inducer of thermogenic activity (PGC-1α) profile in the muscle and adipose tissue. The finding of this study showed that AMIE exposure was significantly induced by the increase of circulating PGC-1α as linear to the high-intensity exercise group. On the contrary. the expression of this transcription factor led to decreased post-AMIE-musical co-treatment. It is suggested that AMIE can induce thermogenesis in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue by modulating oxidative phosphorylation within mitochondria. In summary. the AMIE model may provide an alternative solution to combat metabolic syndrome linked obesity through enhancing the beta-oxidation process. Thus. the expanding investigation with a large sample and long-term monitoring program is required to establish this physical training program in the population.,True,i1a0t50AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hendra_Susanto3/publication/340854583_The_alteration_of_PGC-1a_expression_in_younger_non-professional_athletes_with_acute_medium_intensity_exercise_model/links/5ea3e99c92851c1a906d1bd2/The-alteration-of-PGC-1a-expression-in-younger-non-professional-athletes-with-acute-medium-intensity-exercise-model.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hendra_Susanto3/publication/340854583_The_alteration_of_PGC-1a_expression_in_younger_non-professional_athletes_with_acute_medium_intensity_exercise_model/links/5ea3e99c92851c1a906d1bd2/The-alteration-of-PGC-1a-expression-in-younger-non-professional-athletes-with-acute-medium-intensity-exercise-model.pdf,0,0,0

Analyze the data of foreign and domestic literature on viruses that infect gladioli. risks for domestic agriculture. present the results of the study of viral diseases on gladioli in Ukraine.Methods. Review of information in foreign and domestic literature on viruses that infect gladioli. Visual diagnostics. transmission electron microscopy. double sandwich enzyme immunoassay (DAS-ELISA).Results. Gladioli infect viruses: cucumber mosaic virus. bean yellow mosaic virus. tobacco rattle virus. tobacco ringspot virus. which belongs to regulated pests in Ukraine. These pathogens are common on all continents where plants are grown. have a wide range of host plants and pose a potential threat to crops. In the case of a systemic reaction of a plant to a viral infection. the symptoms lead to a loss of aesthetic value by the plant. economic losses in the floriculture industry. degeneration of varieties in the collections of botanical gardens and private farms. problems in further selective selection for creating new varieties. Possible means of protection and prevention of the spread of viruses to other types of cultivated plants are considered.Conclusions. Gladiolus plants can infect 9 types of viruses. among which the most common and harmful are cucumber mosaic. yellow bean mosaic and tobacco pogrimovka viruses. A yellow bean mosaic virus and a cucumber mosaic virus have been identified in Ukraine. It is especially dangerous that these viral infections can be asymptomatic and gladioli become reservoirs for the preservation and transmission of viruses to other plant crops sensitive to pathogens.,True,HLxk59gAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,0,http://kr.ipp.gov.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/62,,,,http://kr.ipp.gov.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/62,0,0,0

Biotechnical Faculty,Plant diseases caused by bacteria are a serious problem in the cultivation and storage of agricultural products. During the last years bacteriophages have attracted increased research interest as a realistic environmentally friendly means for controlling bacterial diseases. The main objective of the study was to characterize the bacteriophages that could be used in the search for and developing the antimicrobial agents based on bacterial viruses. Four isolates of bacteriophages specific to bacteria from Pseudomonas genus were isolated from potato samples with typical symptoms of bacterial disease. These phage isolates differed in terms of the morphology of their negative colonies. Slight variation in the morphology of studied phages was observed using electron microscopy. A group of phages was identified as Podoviridae family of Caudovirales order (icosahedral head without long tail. small size–head diameter 43±1 nm. tail length 1±0. 5 nm). To identify host range/specificity of isolated phages. we analyzed the spectrum of lytic activity against 15 strains of phytopathogenic bacteria. Our research revealed that among four phage samples three expressed lytic activity against different strains of phytopathogenic bacteria. The aforementioned data enable us to conclude that these three isolates with broad spectrum of lytic activity can be used as perspective biologic agents in control of bacteriosis. Thereby phages from our collection could be of therapeutic interest. they have the potential to be used in future prospects for phage therapy research.,True,HLxk59gAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,0,http://89.188.43.75/agricultforest/20171213-07%20Sovinska%20et%20al..pdf,,,,http://89.188.43.75/agricultforest/20171213-07%20Sovinska%20et%20al..pdf,0,0,0

Ambystomatidae). Darevskia lindholmi. Lacerta agilis exigua (Reptilia. Lacertidae). Erinaceus roumanicus (Mammalia. Erinaceidae). Macrobiotus sp. 1 and 2 (Eutardigrada. Macrobiotidae) and Cameraria ohridella (Insecta. Gracillariidae). The sequences were compared with available sequences from databases and positioned on phylogenetic trees when the taxa had not yet been sequenced. The presence of Mexican axolotls in herpetoculture in Ukraine was confirmed. The partial COI genes of the Crimean rock lizard and an eastern sub-species of the sand lizard were sequenced. We demonstrated the presence of two tardigrade mitochondrial lineages of the Macrobiotus hufelandi group in the same sample from the Zeya Natural Reserve in the Far East: one was nearly identical to the Italian M. macrocalix. and the other one is similar to M. persimilis and M. vladimiri.

Illegal Fishing and Enformance of Effort in Natuna Sea Region between Indonesia and China,2019,Gayuh Nugroho Dwi Putranto and Muhammad Zid and Mieke Miarsyah,9,Jurnal Perikanan dan Kelautan,2,185-193,,Indonesia tries to protect sea areas to avoid illegal fishing cases and maritime boundary disputes. Illegal fishing that occurred in Natuna resulted in decreased income from the fishery side due to the existence of illegal fishing practices. Various attempts have been made by the Indonesian government to deal with illegal fishing by foreign fishermen and local fishermen. The case of illegal fishing that occurred at the end of 2019 was carried out by the Chinese state in Natuna waters which had triggered tension between Indonesia and China. which was triggered by different perceptions related to maritime boundaries where China used the nine-dash line concept that was not by UNCLOS recognized by the UN. This study aims to explain the nine-dash line concept that underlies unilateral claims to China. and the concept of UNCLOS which underlies ownership of the Natuna waters by Indonesia and efforts to enforce illegal fishing in the Natuna Islands. The study was conducted descriptively based on secondary data based on Indonesia's sovereign rights over the Natuna Islands. The results show that China's claim to Natuna based on the nine-dash lines does not form the basis of applicable international law,True,Y12KPb8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,http://jurnal.untirta.ac.id/index.php/jpk/article/view/7243,2739524978735489777,/scholar?cites=2739524978735489777,,http://jurnal.untirta.ac.id/index.php/jpk/article/viewFile/7243/5759,0,0,0

Education is a conscious and planned effort to realize the atmosphere of learning and the learning process so that students are able to develop their potential. Education in Indonesia aims to educate the nation's life. Indonesia's education system in its development continues to make changes. The zoning policy in education is one form of positive response from the government. in order to equalize education in each region. The zoning policy requires each student to go to school the closest distance from their residence. Schools provide about 90% of the student capacity measured by distance. The zoning policy in its development still leaves various problems. A common problem is the unavailability of educational facilities in a sub-district area so that some students have the potential to not go to school. Bekasi City is a metropolitan city that serves as a buffer for the capital city. In its development. Bekasi City has the potential to experience problems of inequality in the number of students and absorption in schools.

The metabotropic (mGluR) and ionotropic (iGluR) receptors have been employed in treating a range of cancers and commonest ones like carcinoma of Lung. Breast. Prostrate. oral cancer in which mGluR 1-8 (group I. II. III) are accountable whereas (iGluR) ionotropic glutamate receptors which cover NMDA and NON NMDA receptors. have an affect a variety of cancers otherwise. NMDARs are further divided into subunits and influence mTOR signaling pathway significantly. Hence. anti-cancer agents specific to NMDARs are indicated in such scenarios like that of Memantine. Ifenprodil or Diclozipine. Some subunits; AMPARs and KARs. endure glutamine to Arginine (Q/R) site specific ribonucleic acid (RNA) editing inflicting changes in Ca permeability as well as its action that is seen to be altered in tumors. Therefore. their antagonists would prove functional. Since AMPAR. KARs have a giant role in neural development and processes. they have chiefly been detected in brain tumors not that their contribution in further cancers can be neglected. Delta or orphan receptors are primarily classified owing to sequence homology. In contrast to the rest of the iGluRs. these cannot be activated by any other receptors (AMPA. NMDA. KAR).

1093945,ORAL CANCER SHOWING EPITHELIAL MESENCHYMAL TRANSITIONS: NEED FOR A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH Category,,Shree Goyal,,,,,,Introduction: With the increasing mortality and drug resistance for cancer cases despite advances in anti-cancer treatment strategies. it is imperative to understand the changes occurring at the molecular level at the tumour invasive front. E-Cadherin is a molecular marker which is marker for cell adhesion and vimentin is marker for mesenchymal properties within a cell. Recent development of drug resistant variants of oral squamous cell carcinoma has urged a need for evaluation of epithelial mesenchymal transitions taking place at the tumor invasive front in order to understand pathophysiological reasoning behind this aberrant behavior with therapeutic insights.Aim: To evaluate and characterize epithelial and mesenchymal properties of tumour cells at the invasive front in Oral squamous cell carcinoma and to formulate pathophysiological basis for development of newer treatment strategies in oral cancer cases.Materials And Method: Histopathologically confirmed tissue samples of Oral squamous cell carcinoma (n= 5) were selected based on WHO criteria (2005). Immunohistoichemical analysis of E cadherin and Vimentin (Biogenex Inc.) was done using standard streptavidin biotin and heat induced epitope retrieval method. All the slides were evaluated for immunoexpression at the tumour invasive front to assess the epithelial mesenchymal transition.Result: The cells which were proliferating at invasive front showed loss of E-cadherin and were positive for vimentin. These results were indicative of changes occurring at the molecular level in the tumour cells suggestive of attainment of mesenchymal properties in the proliferating epithelial cells …,True,fHdCZGQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/24Oct201910101229%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Shree%20Goyal%202%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2061-63.pdf,,,,https://www.krishisanskriti.org/vol_image/24Oct201910101229%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Shree%20Goyal%202%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2061-63.pdf,0,0,0

This work explored the causes of occurrence and recurrence of fish kill in the context of finding adaptive solution. Dataset for the study was generated through key informant interview. focused group discussion and secondary data analysis. Problem Tree was used to identify the root-cause and SWOT analysis was employed to craft best practice guideline for Local Government Unit in outlining the action plans for management of cage aquaculture. Findings reveal the fish kill occurrence can be traced from the natural and human-induced stresses and mismanagement of lake’s resources. Typhoons and prevailing trade winds play a major role as triggering factor while the uncontrolled number of cages and unsustainable farming practices are the major determinants of fish kill event. The interaction between water temperature. dissolved oxygen. wind mixing and by-products of decomposition (ie ammonia-nitrogen and H2S) as a result of overfeed and lake over-use are the key elements of fish kill in the lake. Monitoring critical levels of water temperature and dissolved oxygen is useful information in fish kill prediction.

Fish of the genus Danio display colour patterns ranging from horizontal stripes. to vertical bars or spots. Stripe formation in zebrafish. Danio rerio. is a self-organizing process based on cell− contact mediated interactions between three types of chromatophores with a leading role of iridophores. Here we investigate genes known to regulate chromatophore interactions in zebrafish that might have evolved to produce a pattern of vertical bars in its sibling species. Danio aesculapii. Mutant D. aesculapii indicate a lower complexity in chromatophore interactions and a minor role of iridophores in patterning. Reciprocal hemizygosity tests identify the potassium channel gene obelix/Kcnj13 as evolved between the two species. Complementation tests suggest evolutionary change through divergence in Kcnj13 function …,True,_84vilwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20021-6,,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20021-6,0,0,0

Phosphatidyl 3-kinases (PI3K) are a family of lipid kinases involved in many cellular processes. including cell growth. proliferation. differentiation. motility. and survival. that can inhibit therapy profoundly. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers and is further subtyped into adenocarcinoma. squamous cell carcinoma. and large cell carcinoma. Somatic oncogenic alterations can further molecularly subdivide these NSCLC subtypes. The general objective of the current work was to study the prevalence of PIK3CA expression and mutations in tumor microenvironment of human NSCLC. Materials and Methods. Thirty-three paraffin blocks were utilized from NSCLC archival cases for further investigations by using immunohistochemical staining and PCR/sequencing techniques for examination of PI3KCA cellular expression and detection of mutation in exons 9 and / or 20 of PI3KCA …,True,sdlsfo8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1294/6/062112/meta,,,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1294/6/062112/pdf,0,0,0

1093969,BENTHIC FEATURES OF CORAL PATCH REEFS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ABUNDANCE OF THE TRICOLOR PARROTFISH (SCARUS TRICOLOR) IN SOLONG-ON LAGOON. SIQUIJOR ISLAND. PHILIPPINES,2020,Karl Roy C Mamhot,7,Journal of Critical Reviews,11,241-247,Innovare Academics Sciences,Reef patches are typically small. sheltered coral aggregations that often host high abundance and diversity of reef fish. many of which spend only part of their life-cycle (often during their juvenile stages) before returning to the coral reef as adults. and one good example is Parrotfish (eg Scarus tricolor). This species has been aimed at local artisanal fishing. However. very little information is available in the literature on the ecology of this species (especially during its juvenile stage) and on the function of back-reef nursery habitat characteristics (benthic features). Between March and May 2019. benthic surveys quantified 11 benthic features of the reef patches in the Solong-on Lagoon. The relationship between benthic features has been visualized using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multicollinearity with a threshold of 10 was avoided by the use of the variance-inflation factor (vif) test. The predictor variables were selected using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) against the abundance of S. Tricolor as the variable of response. Reef scale requires a mean diameter and a surface area of between 3.65-19.25 m and 96.08-1484.21 m2. Reef difficulty varies from medium-very high vertical relief. 1.5-3.5 slope and 1.07-1.70 roughness. PCA has shown that the reef surface area. dead corals and live hard corals are the most influential variables between reef patches. The mean fish abundance ranged from 0.33 to 13.33 individuals/m2 and did not differ significantly between months and sampling sites. Of the eight independent variables (benthic characteristics) modeled using GLM. two variables (reef patch size and dead coral cover) were …,True,BKkO0c8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://www.jcreview.com/fulltext/197-1590731581.pdf,,,,http://www.jcreview.com/fulltext/197-1590731581.pdf,0,0,0

What drives a newly fertilized egg to keep dividing and growing until it becomes 40 trillion cells. a greater number than stars in the galaxy? How do these cells know how to make a human. from lips to heart to toes? How does your body build itself? Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz was pregnant at 42 when a routine genetic test came back with that dreaded word: abnormal. A quarter of sampled cells contained abnormalities and she was warned her baby had an increased risk of being miscarried or born with birth defects. Six months later she gave birth to a healthy baby boy and her research on mice embryos went on to prove that–as she had suspected–the embryo has an amazing and previously unknown ability to correct abnormal cells at an early stage of its development. The Dance of Life will take you inside the incredible world of life just as it begins and reveal the wonder of the earliest and most profound moments in how we become human. Through Magda’s trailblazing research as a professor at Cambridge–where she has doubled the survival time of human embryos in the laboratory. and made the first artificial embryo-like structures from stem cells–you’ll discover how early life is programmed to repair and organise itself. what this means for the future of pregnancy. and how we might one day solve IVF disorders. prevent miscarriages and learn more about the dance of life as it starts to take shape.

The main advantages of tertiary treatments that use biological systems are the low cost investment and the minimal dependence on environmental variables. In this work we demonstrate that filamentous algae reduces the nutrient load of nitrate (circa 75%) and phosphate (circa 86%) from the organic waste effluents coming from dairy farms after nine days of culture. with the added advantage being that after the treatment period. algae removal can be achieved by simple procedures. Currently. the organic wastewater is discarded into fields and local streams. However. the algae can acquire value as a by-product since it has various uses as compost. cellulose. and biogas. A disadvantage of this system is that clean water must be used to achieve enough water transparency to allow algae growth. Even so. the nutrient reduction system of the organic effluents proposed is friendly to the ecosystem. compared to tertiary treatments that use chemicals to precipitate and collect nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates.,True,IJwW_SUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1519-69842020005021202&script=sci_arttext,,,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1519-69842020005021202&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

The main aim of the study was to evaluate rice diseases in selected G.N.divisions of Sithandi. Karadiyanaaru and Eravur. 75 random paddy farmers were interviewed with structured questionnaire. Followed by a quadrate (1’×1’) was used to assess the type of diseases prevailed in the field. Disease prevalence was calculated as the proportion of fields showing the disease. out of the total number of fields assessed. Disease incidences were determined as the proportion of plants showing symptoms. expressed as a percentage of the total number of plants assessed. From the survey findings it was noted that 10 rice varieties such as BW 361. BG 360. BG 356. BG 300. AT 308. AT 362. LD 365. BG 357. BG 358 and BG 352 were cultivated all over the study area. Further. results of the field assessment revealed that blast and sheath blight were found to be more prevailed diseases with 88% and 86.7% respectively. Further blast and sheath blight showed highest incidence with respective percentages of 35.3% and 41.7%. Out of 10 varieties cultivated across the selected paddy fields. variety AT308 and BG360 were found to be more susceptible for blast and sheath blight respectively while the variety BG 358 was resistant for blast and blight.

1094016,Analysis of novel photosynthetic traits in a rice deletion mutant population,2013,Mohamed Mubarak Ahamadeen Nagoor,,,,,,The 'C4 rice project' aims to introduce the C4 photosynthetic mechanism into C3 rice plant in order to boost biomass and grain yield to cope with the predicted food demand and adverse environmental conditions in the future. As a first step. identification of rice mutants with novel photosynthetic traits conferring increased photosynthetic capacities is an utmost requirement in order to improve biomass production. One approach is to screen large numbers of rice mutants to achieve this goal. This would confirm whether the rice genome possesses the required 'plasticity' to introduce C4-like traits. Two traits are ubiquitous in the C4 syndrome and can be introduced into high throughput screens: anatomically they have higher leaf vein densities and physiologically they have lower CO2 compensation points (r). As a first step. a systematic screening experiment was conducted to identify C4 properties in a gamma-induced. EMS-induced mutant populations of IR64. The major objectives are to develop reliable rapid screening techniques and to identify C4-like photosynthetic traits in rice. A mass-screening chamber with low-C02 treatment (1000 seedlings per week) was used. Rice seedlings at 5th leaf stage were exposed to 60 ppm CO2 for the first day and 30 ppm for the remaining three days. Following this. putative candidates were identified by measuring chlorophyll using SPAD method by a SPAD depletion % (SPD%) calculation . Phenotypic responses of the mutants were compared with wild type IR64 and with the Cr C4 intermediate Panicum milioides. Initial SPD% results showed a distinct gap between parental wild type IR64 and P. milioides. means …,True,R0JWxhoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.606807,,,,,0,0,0

In this article. we formalize this microbiological goal as a new pattern-matching problem in the domain of gene tree and species tree reconciliation. denoted “Reconciliation-Scenario Altering Mutation (RSAM) Discovery.” We propose an  time algorithm to solve this new problem. where m and n are the number of vertices of the input gene tree and species tree. respectively. and k is a user-specified parameter that bounds from above the number of optimal solutions of interest.

Nowadays. in vitro tests are widely employed to study the mechanotransduction induced by substrate deformation. The aim of in vitro systems is to properly reproduce the mechanical stimuli sensed by the tissue in the cellular microenvironment. Accurate strain measurement and control is therefore necessary to ensure the cell senses the proper strain for the entire treatment. Different types of in vitro systems are commercially available or can be custom-designed; however. none of these devices performs a real-time measurement of the induced strains.

1094072,Studies on the effects of xenobiotic on radial growth and dry weight biomass of the soil fungus Trichoderma sp.,2018,MC Freddy Vanlalmuana and R Lalfakzuala,,,,8-12,Atlantis Press,Plant growth and development are greatly influenced by soil edaphic factor and microbial community present in the rhizosphere. Although some microorganisms are important. some can cause disease in plants and lead to the death of the plant. Trichoderma sp. is an important soil fungus which has the potential to control other soil-borne plant pathogens. To measure the bio-efficacy of Trichoderma sp. in integrated pest management. its compatibility along with other pesticides has to be assessed. GLV-71 (nitrosoglyphosate) and Elpida (emamectin benzoate) are the two commonly used herbicides and insecticides worldwide. We investigated the application of these two pesticides with their effect on the growth of Trichoderma sp. Different concentrations (half dose. field recommended dose and double dose) of the two pesticides were tested on the growth of the selected fungal species in vitro. The result shows that nitrosoglyphosate and emamectin benzoate have concentration dependent effect on the growth of Trichoderma sp. Between the two pesticides. GLV-71 shows greater effect on the growth of the microorganism. This experiment shows that Elpida exhibit more compatibility along with Trichoderma sp. as a potential bio-control agent rather than GLV-71.,True,qXaIN8oAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/msc-18/55909723,,,,https://download.atlantis-press.com/article/55909723.pdf,0,0,0

1094087,Foraging fidelity and individual specialisation in a temperate bat Myotis Nattereri,2019,Simone Mordue and Aileen Mill and Mark Shirley and James Aegerter,,BioRxiv,,713750,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Bat populations have declined globally over the last century largely due to anthropogenic change. Many temperate forest species of bat appear loyal to their foraging sites however. conservation of these sites rather than just habitat types is rarely considered and is essential to protect bat populations. It is not clear whether site fidelity in bats is species-specific or a more general trait or why it is exhibited but behaviour patterns could be important for conservation and management objectives. Foraging variation may occur due to ‘individual specialisation’. such that individuals differ significantly in their prey or habitat utilisation. independent of class-effects. If bats do exhibit individuality in their habitat choice. then protection of a mosaic of habitats rather than single preferred habitat per species may be critical to their conservation.The goal here was to determine whether Natterer’s bats show fidelity in their foraging choices and whether they show individual specialisation in their foraging habits.Thirty-four individual bats were tracked for at least one full night. from two different sites.Site fidelity in Natterer’s was consistent across a range of intervals (months and years) despite contrasting seasonal contexts. Individuals repeatedly exploited specific foraging locations and showed individual specialisation in their habitat use which is consistent with the behaviour of a territorial species.Studies designed to inform conservation and management of temperate bats should attempt to maximize the number of individuals from which movement data is sought. whilst ensuring that data represent a coherent and meaningful measure of behaviour such as a single full …,True,7GoRlbYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/713750v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/07/25/713750.full.pdf,0,0,0
1094088,How does the spatial and social dynamics of the Natterer's bat Myotis nattereri affect disease transmission and conservation?,2019,Simone Michelle Mordue,,,,,,Natterer’s bats (Myotis nattereri) are typical of many Bat species in that they  participate in a variety of distinct seasonal communities and behaviours. In summer  adult females are thought to be largely philopatric to their natal community/landscape  where they rear their young and form largely matrilineal communities. Bat foraging  behaviour and social participation is largely unquantified. as is our understanding of  how age/maturity and sex may mediate their social behaviour. Crucially. the rate of  female dispersal between communities is completely unquantified. A much better  understanding of bat spatial and social dynamics is necessary to inform statutory  functions. effective conservation and epidemiological modelling. We have mapped and  quantified the spatial and social dynamics of three communities of Natterer’s bats.  Uniquely our roost switching data comes from a community roosting entirely in  natural roosts.  Radio-tracking. ringing and DNA evidence can be combined at one site.  whilst ringing and DNA can be combined at two others.  In addition. DNA samples from  a further two sites could be included to complete the comparison of 183 Natterer’s  bats from 5 sites. Microsatellite data (based on 15 markers) was used to describe  relatedness at two functional scales (between roosts within a community and between  communities). Relatedness and population structure was also compared to home  range analysis and roost use to determine if related individuals forage close to each  other or share a roosts more frequently than unrelated individuals.

Increasing anthropogenic pressure on bats has led to an increase in zoonotic disease outbreaks. There is a need for a broad understanding of bat ecology and behaviour to inform conservation and disease management. We used microsatellite markers to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure present in Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri colonies to determine whether summer roosting bat colonies were spatially distinct or part of a meta-population. Structure analysis along with relatedness values. suggest spatially distinct populations of bats exhibit long term site fidelity to summer roosting sites. whilst high genetic diversity at sites indicates gene exchange occurs via swarming sites. Natterer’s bats travel greater distances to swarming sites than has been previously documented. Although this maintains genetic diversity. it raises concerns for disease transmission. Disease monitoring of bats should take place at the summer roosts which may then be more easily isolated before transmission occurs across further bat communities during autumn swarming. Local adaptation. as implied by mitochondrial analysis. has taken place in Natterer’s bats colonies. which suggests long term viability of the species. However. it highlights the importance of swarming sites as gene exchange locations to prevent these genetically different sites from becoming isolated.,True,7GoRlbYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simone_Mordue/publication/331650901_Population_structure_gene_flow_and_disease_management_of_Natterer's_bats_in_Northern_England/links/5c866e51299bf16918f73308/Population-structure-gene-flow-and-disease-management-of-Natterers-bats-in-Northern-England,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simone_Mordue/publication/331650901_Population_structure_gene_flow_and_disease_management_of_Natterer's_bats_in_Northern_England/links/5c866e51299bf16918f73308/Population-structure-gene-flow-and-disease-management-of-Natterers-bats-in-Northern-England,0,0,0
1094091,How do Natterer’s Bats Myotis nattereri choose where to roost?,,Simone Mordue and James Aegerter and Steven Rushton and Aileen Mill,,,,,,Bats have been described as exhibiting central place foraging (CP) behaviour. Indeed Rainho and Palmeirim 2011. concluded that distances to resources from the roost are determinant in the way bats forage across a landscape [1]. Conversely other studies have concluded that bats are faithful to their foraging patches returning to the same patch each night but roost selection is variable based on social decision making [2] and bats switch roost often whilst returning to the same patch to forage. Alternatively bats might respond to other drivers of behaviour to explain the spatial relationships between foraging patches and roost choices (eg thermal/energetic or epidemiological).Previous work with Natterer’s bats has suggested that they continually re-sort themselves across a restricted network of roosts and individuals within the community constantly move across this network [3]. Mortimer 2006. found that every individual bat he radio tracked used the same core foraging areas regardless of where they roosted [4]. Here we attempt to address the CP foraging debate to determine whether distance to roost. social cohesion or another driver is key in roost selection for Natterer’s bats.,True,7GoRlbYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simone_Mordue/publication/266266729_How_do_Natterer's_bats_Myotis_nattereri_decide_where_to_roost/links/542bee5d0cf29bbc126ac155/How-do-Natterers-bats-Myotis-nattereri-decide-where-to-roost,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Simone_Mordue/publication/266266729_How_do_Natterer's_bats_Myotis_nattereri_decide_where_to_roost/links/542bee5d0cf29bbc126ac155/How-do-Natterers-bats-Myotis-nattereri-decide-where-to-roost,0,0,0
1094092,MOLECULAR SIMULATION: THE POTENCY OF CONSERVED REGION ON E6 HPV-16 AS A BINDING TARGET OF BLACK TEA COMPOUNDS AGAINST CERVICAL CANCER,2017,Viol Dhea Kharisma and Arif Nur Muhammad Ansori and Muhammad Hermawan Widyananda and Santika Lusia Utami and Alexander PateraNugraha,6,molecules,p53,,,Cervical cancer ranks fourth as the deadliest cancer in women in this part of the world. around 0.5 million women and close to 0.25 million people infected with cervical cancer. some of which is caused by infection with infectious agents such as human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV consists of 2 types of genes late (L) for structural protein and early (E) for functional. E protein. which plays a crucial role in normal cell transformation called E6. E6 affects p53 activity in cells by forming the E6-p53 complex. thus directing the complex to the mechanism of degradation through the proteasome pathway. E6 has a specific binding on the conserved region. it interacts with p53. therefore the potency of E6 HPV-16 conserved region is the focus of this study. Previous research explained. the black tea compounds were identified as inhibitor effects on various types of viral infections in vitro. but the molecular mechanism was still unknown. Therefore. this study aims to identify the functional conserved region in E6 HPV-16 from all strains and chemical compounds of black tea that have the potential to become inhibitors through in silico studies. to obtain drug candidates that prevent cervical cancer. The analytical method used in this research is in silico consisting of identification of conserved region E6 HPV-16. protein modeling. docking. and molecular interaction. The results showed that all chemical compounds contained in black tea were able to act as E6 HPV-16 inhibitors by binding directly to the conserved functional region used to interact with p53. The binding of these complex compounds can affect in a biological activity of E6. so it is predicted that p53 will not be …,True,NYjxuW8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Viol_Kharisma/publication/343415589_Molecular_Simulation_The_Potency_of_Conserved_Region_on_E6_HPV-16_as_a_Binding_Target_of_Black_Tea_Compounds_Against_Cervical_Cancer/links/5f28f474a6fdcccc43a89e06/Molecular-Simulation-The-Potency-of-Conserved-Region-on-E6-HPV-16-as-a-Binding-Target-of-Black-Tea-Compounds-Against-Cervical-Cancer.pdf,11907655234644332568,/scholar?cites=11907655234644332568,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Viol_Kharisma/publication/343415589_Molecular_Simulation_The_Potency_of_Conserved_Region_on_E6_HPV-16_as_a_Binding_Target_of_Black_Tea_Compounds_Against_Cervical_Cancer/links/5f28f474a6fdcccc43a89e06/Molecular-Simulation-The-Potency-of-Conserved-Region-on-E6-HPV-16-as-a-Binding-Target-of-Black-Tea-Compounds-Against-Cervical-Cancer.pdf,0,0,0

In developing countries. the infection is more severe than in developed countries. Initial infection is likely to arise at an early age and rise in incidence with age. The incidence of the infection is influenced by ethnic and racial influences. social background. and living environments. Geographical location. sex. ethnicity. educational level. health. and socio-economic status are among the factors affecting Helicobacter pylori infection. The infection is associated with some diseases such as iron deficiency anemia. B12 deficiency. There is proof of a link in children between Helicobacter pylori infection and antral gastritis. and duodenal ulcer disease. Invasive and non-invasive procedures may be used for treatment. while the gold standard is a GI tract biopsy specimen. The most frequent diagnosis in infanthood Helicobacter pylori infection is nodular gastritis.
