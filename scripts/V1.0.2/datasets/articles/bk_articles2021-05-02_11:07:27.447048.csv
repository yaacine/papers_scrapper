1281436,SAVI: Synthetic apertures for long-range. subdiffraction-limited visible imaging using Fourier ptychography,2017,Jason Holloway and Yicheng Wu and Manoj K Sharma and Oliver Cossairt and Ashok Veeraraghavan,3,Science advances,4,e1602564,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Synthetic aperture radar is a well-known technique for improving resolution in radio imaging. Extending these synthetic aperture techniques to the visible light domain is not straightforward because optical receivers cannot measure phase information. We propose to use macroscopic Fourier ptychography (FP) as a practical means of creating a synthetic aperture for visible imaging to achieve subdiffraction-limited resolution. We demonstrate the first working prototype for macroscopic FP in a reflection imaging geometry that is capable of imaging optically rough objects. In addition. a novel image space denoising regularization is introduced during phase retrieval to reduce the effects of speckle and improve perceptual quality of the recovered high-resolution image. Our approach is validated experimentally where the resolution of various diffuse objects is improved sixfold.,True,SloyGEkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,57,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602564.short,6524510858500521858,/scholar?cites=6524510858500521858,,,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/3/4/e1602564.full.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we present an approach for single frame. single viewpoint. passive 3D imaging using a phase mask at the aperture plane of a camera. Our approach relies on an end-to-end optimization framework to jointly learn the optimal phase mask and the reconstruction algorithm that allows an accurate estimation of range image from captured data. Using our optimization framework. we design a new phase mask that performs significantly better than existing approaches.

1281438,WISH: wavefront imaging sensor with high resolution,2019,Yicheng Wu and Manoj Kumar Sharma and Ashok Veeraraghavan,8,Light: Science & Applications,1,1-10,Nature Publishing Group,Wavefront sensing is the simultaneous measurement of the amplitude and phase of an incoming optical field. Traditional wavefront sensors such as Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) suffer from a fundamental tradeoff between spatial resolution and phase estimation and consequently can only achieve a resolution of a few thousand pixels. To break this tradeoff. we present a novel computational-imaging-based technique. namely. the Wavefront Imaging Sensor with High resolution (WISH). We replace the microlens array in SHWFS with a spatial light modulator (SLM) and use a computational phase-retrieval algorithm to recover the incident wavefront. This wavefront sensor can measure highly varying optical fields at more than 10-megapixel resolution with the fine phase estimation. To the best of our knowledge. this resolution is an order of magnitude higher than the current noninterferometric wavefront …,True,SloyGEkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,25,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-019-0154-x,18111841762235987744,/scholar?cites=18111841762235987744,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-019-0154-x,0,0,0

Although the reconstructed complex field encodes the depth information of the object. it is impractical to be used as a depth sensor for macroscopic objects. since the unambiguous depth imaging range is limited by the optical wavelength. To improve the depth range of imaging and handle depth discontinuities. we propose a novel three-dimensional sensor by leveraging wavelength diversity and wavefront sensing. Complex fields at two optical wavelengths are recorded. and a synthetic wavelength can be generated by correlating those wavefronts. The proposed system achieves high lateral and depth resolutions.

Inspired by the extended depth of field cameras. we propose a novel end-to-end learning-based technique to overcome this limitation. by introducing a phase mask at the aperture plane of the cameras in a stereo imaging system. The phase mask creates a depth-dependent point spread function. allowing us to recover sharp image texture and stereo correspondence over a significantly extended depth of field (EDOF) than conventional stereo. The phase mask pattern. the EDOF image reconstruction. and the stereo disparity estimation are all trained together using an end-to-end learned deep neural network. We perform theoretical analysis and characterization of the proposed approach and show a 6x increase in volume that can be imaged in simulation.

It is caused by either multiple reflections within the lens or scattering due to scratches or dust on the lens. and may appear in a wide variety of patterns: halos. streaks. color bleeding. haze. etc. The diversity in its appearance makes flare removal extremely challenging. Existing software methods make strong assumptions about the artifacts' geometry or brightness. and thus only handle a small subset of flares. We take a principled approach to explicitly model the optical causes of flare. which leads to a novel semi-synthetic pipeline for generating flare-corrupted images from both empirical and wave-optics-simulated lens flares. Using the semi-synthetic data generated by this pipeline. we build a neural network to remove lens flare.

The need for treatment is determined by the presence or change of disease-specific OCTbased biomarkers. Therefore. the monitoring frequency has a significant influence on the success of AMD therapy. However. the monitoring frequency of current treatment schemes is not individually adapted to the patient and therefore often insufficient. While a higher monitoring frequency would have a positive effect on the success of treatment. in practice it can only be achieved with a home monitoring solution. One of the key requirements of a home monitoring OCT system is a computer-aided diagnosis to automatically detect and quantify pathological changes using specific OCT-based biomarkers.

In order to improve their pronunciation. this can be done by a human being such as teacher or parents. However. it is difficult to discover the error in the pronunciation without talking with each student individually. With a large number of students in classes nowadays. it is difficult for teachers to communicate with students separately. Therefore. this study proposes an automatic speech recognition system which has the capacity to detect the incorrect phoneme pronunciation. This system can automatically support children to improve their pronunciation by directly asking children to pronounce a phoneme and the system can tell them if it is correct or not. In the future. the system can give them the correct pronunciation and let them practise until they get the correct pronunciation. In order to construct this system. an experiment was done to collect the speech database. In this experiment 89. elementary school children were asked to produce 28 Arabic phonemes 10 times. The collected database contains 890 utterances for each phoneme.

This obliges the controller to overcome complex problems such as uncertainty and nonlinearity involved in the dynamics of the system. robot and patients.

We also assess tumor segmentation performance using the reconstructed permittivity as a feature. The contrast source inversion (CSI) technique is used to create the complex-permittivity images of the breast with ultrasound-derived tissue regions utilized as prior information. However. imaging artifacts make the detection of tumors difficult. To overcome this issue we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes in. as input. the dual-modal CSI reconstruction and attempts to produce the true image of the complex tissue permittivity. The neural network consists of successive convolutional and downsampling layers. followed by successive deconvolutional and upsampling layers based on the U-Net architecture. To train the neural network. the input-output pairs consist of CSI’s dual-modal reconstructions. along with the true numerical phantom images from which the microwave scattered field was synthetically generated. The reconstructed permittivity images produced by the CNN show that the network is not only able to remove the artifacts that are typical of CSI reconstructions. but can also improve the detectability of tumors. The performance of the CNN is assessed using a four-fold cross-validation on our dataset that shows improvement over CSI both in terms of reconstruction error and tumor segmentation performance.

The developed technique is an extension of one created to enhance 2D images. We employ a 3D Convolutional Neural Network. based on the U-Net architecture. that takes in 3D images obtained using the Contrast-Source Inversion (CSI) method and attempts to produce the true 3D image of the permittivity. The training set consists of 3D CSI images. along with the true numerical phantom images from which the microwave scattered field utilized to create the CSI reconstructions was synthetically generated. Each numerical phantom varies with respect to the size. number. and location of tumors within the fibroglandular region. The reconstructed permittivity images produced by the proposed 3D U-Net show that the network is not only able to remove the artifacts that are typical of CSI reconstructions. but it also enhances the detectability of the tumors. We test the trained U-Net with 3D images obtained from experimentally collected microwave data as well as with images obtained synthetically. Significantly. the results illustrate that although the network was trained using only images obtained from synthetic data. it performed well with images obtained from both synthetic and experimental data.

The majority of existing control approaches are based on control torque strategy. which require the knowledge of robot dynamics as well as dynamic of patients. This requires the controller to overcome complex problems such as uncertainties and nonlinearities involved in the dynamic of the system. robot and patients. On the other hand. how impedance parameters must be selected is a serious question in control system design for rehabilitation robots. To resolve these problems this paper. presents a variable impedance control based on the voltage control strategy. In contrast to the usual current-based (torque mode) the use of motor dynamics lees to a computationally faster and more realistic voltage-base controller. The most important advantage of the proposed control strategy is that the nonlinear dynamic of rehabilitation robot is handled as an external load. hence the control law is free from robot dynamic and the impedance controller is computationally simpler. faster and more robust with negligible tracking error. Moreover. variable impedance parameters based on Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic (IT2Fl) is proposed to evaluate impedance parameters. The proposed control is verified by a stability analysis.

Registration of multiple scans typically follows a two-stage pipeline: the initial pairwise alignment and the globally consistent refinement. The former is often ambiguous due to the low overlap of neighboring point clouds. symmetries and repetitive scene parts. Therefore. the latter global refinement aims at establishing the cyclic consistency across multiple scans and helps in resolving the ambiguous cases. In this paper we propose. to the best of our knowledge. the first end-to-end algorithm for joint learning of both parts of this two-stage problem. Experimental evaluation on well accepted benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a significant margin. while being end-to-end trainable and computationally less costly.

Different from previous work. our model is specifically designed to handle (also) point-cloud pairs with low overlap.

In this way the subsequent decoding of the latent representations into per-point features is conditioned on the respective other point cloud. and thus can predict which points are not only salient. but also lie in the overlap region between the two point clouds. The ability to focus on points that are relevant for matching greatly improves performance: PREDATOR raises the rate of successful registrations by more than 20% in the low-overlap scenario. and also sets a new state of the art for the 3DMatch benchmark with 89% registration recall.

By contrast to most speech enhancement algorithms that overlook the speech variability mainly caused by phoneme structure. our framework comprises a set of deep neural networks (DNNs). each one of which is an'expert'in enhancing a given speech type corresponding to a phoneme. A gating DNN determines which expert is assigned to a given speech segment. A speech presence probability (SPP) is then obtained as a weighted average of the expert SPP decisions. with the weights determined by the gating DNN. A soft spectral attenuation. based on the SPP. is then applied to enhance the noisy speech signal. The experts and the gating components of the DMoE network are trained jointly. As part of the training. speech clustering into different subsets is performed in an unsupervised manner. Therefore. unlike previous methods. a phoneme-labeled database is not required for the training procedure. A series of experiments with different noise types verified the applicability of the new algorithm to the task of speech enhancement.

1281520,Multi-microphone speaker separation based on deep DOA estimation,2019,Shlomo E Chazan and Hodaya Hammer and Gershon Hazan and Jacob Goldberger and Sharon Gannot,,,,1-5,IEEE,In this paper. we present a multi-microphone speech separation algorithm based on masking inferred from the speakers direction of arrival (DOA). According to the W-disjoint orthogonality property of speech signals. each time-frequency (TF) bin is dominated by a single speaker. This TF bin can therefore be associated with a single DOA. In our procedure. we apply a deep neural network (DNN) with a U-net architecture to infer the DOA of each TF bin from a concatenated set of the spectra of the microphone signals. Separation is obtained by multiplying the reference microphone by the masks associated with the different DOAs. Our proposed deep direction estimation for speech separation (DDESS) method is inspired by the recent advances in deep clustering methods.

The existing methods for moving object detection (MOD) only computes class-agnostic pixel-wise binary segmentation of video frames. On the other hand. the object detection techniques do not differentiate between static and moving objects. To the best of our knowledge. this is a first attempt for simultaneous localization and classification of moving objects in a video. ie MOR in a single-stage deep learning framework. We achieve this by labelling axis-aligned bounding boxes for moving objects which requires less computational resources than producing pixel-level estimates. In the proposed MotionRec. both temporal and spatial features are learned using past history and current frames respectively. First. the background is estimated with a temporal depth reductionist (TDR) block. Then the estimated background. current frame and temporal median of recent observations are assimilated to encode spatiotemporal motion saliency. Moreover. feature pyramids are generated from these motion saliency maps to perform regression and classification at multiple levels of feature abstractions. MotionRec works online at inference as it requires only few past frames for MOR. Moreover. it doesn't require predefined target initialization from user.

The synthetic noises adopted in most previous work are pixel-independent. but real noises are mostly spatially/channel-correlated and spatially/channel-variant. This domain gap yields unsatisfied performance on images with real noises if the model is only trained with AWGN. In this paper. we propose a novel approach to boost the performance of a real image denoiser which is trained only with synthetic pixel-independent noise data dominated by AWGN. First. we train a deep model that consists of a noise estimator and a denoiser with mixed AWGN and Random Value Impulse Noise (RVIN). We then investigate Pixel-shuffle Down-sampling (PD) strategy to adapt the trained model to real noises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed approach.

Human action recognition. however. is tremendously challenging for computers due to the complexity of video data and the subtlety of human actions. Most current recognition systems flounder on the inability to separate human actions from co-occurring factors that usually dominate subtle human actions. In this paper. we propose a novel approach for training a human action recognizer. one that can:(1) explicitly factorize human actions from the co-occurring factors;(2) deliberately build a model for human actions and a separate model for all correlated contextual elements; and (3) effectively combine the models for human action recognition. Our approach exploits the benefits of conjugate samples of human actions. which are video clips that are contextually similar to human action samples. but do not contain the action.

However. there is a missing focus on the visualization of deep model training process. To bridge the gap. in this paper. we firstly define a discriminability metric to evaluate neuron evolution and a density metric to investigate output feature maps. Based on these metrics. a level-ofdetail visual analytics framework is proposed to locally and globally inspect the evolution of deep neural networks.

Hand-CNN extends MaskRCNN with a novel attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues in the detection process. This attention mechanism can be implemented as an efficient network module that captures non-local dependencies between features. This network module can be inserted at different stages of an object detection network. and the entire detector can be trained end-to-end. We also introduce large-scale annotated hand datasets containing hands in unconstrained images for training and evaluation. We show that Hand-CNN outperforms existing methods on the newly collected datasets and the publicly available PASCAL VOC human layout dataset.

1281542,Attentive Action and Context Factorization,2020,Yang Wang and Vinh Tran and Gedas Bertasius and Lorenzo Torresani and Minh Hoai,,,,,,We propose a method for human action recognition. one that can localize the spatiotemporal regions thatdefine'the actions. This is a challenging task due to the subtlety of human actions in video and the co-occurrence of contextual elements. To address this challenge. we utilize conjugate samples of human actions. which are video clips that are contextually similar to human action samples but do not contain the action. We introduce a novel attentional mechanism that can spatially and temporally separate human actions from the co-occurring contextual factors. The separation of the action and context factors is weakly supervised. eliminating the need for laboriously detailed annotation of these two factors in training samples. Our method can be used to build human action classifiers with higher accuracy and better interpretability. Experiments on several human action recognition datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative benefits of our approach.,True,OT3Xk68AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05410,10656691692529314192,/scholar?cites=10656691692529314192,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05410,0,0,0
1281543,Back to the future: Knowledge distillation for human action anticipation,2019,Vinh Tran and Yang Wang and Minh Hoai,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.04868,,,,We consider the task of training a neural network to anticipate human actions in video. This task is challenging given the complexity of video data. the stochastic nature of the future. and the limited amount of annotated training data. In this paper. we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that uses an action recognition network to supervise the training of an action anticipation network. guiding the latter to attend to the relevant information needed for correctly anticipating the future actions. This framework is possible thanks to a novel loss function to account for positional shifts of semantic concepts in a dynamic video. The knowledge distillation framework is a form of self-supervised learning. and it takes advantage of unlabeled data.

1281544,Supervoxel Attention Graphs for Long-Range Video Modeling,2021,Yang Wang and Gedas Bertasius and Tae-Hyun Oh and Abhinav Gupta and Minh Hoai and Lorenzo Torresani,,,,,,A significant challenge in video understanding is posed by the high dimensionality of the input. which induces large computational cost and high memory footprints. Deep convolutional models operating on video apply pooling and striding to reduce feature dimensionality and to increase the receptive field. However. despite these strategies. modern approaches cannot effectively leverage spatiotemporal structure over long temporal extents. In this paper we introduce an approach that reduces a video of 10 seconds to a sparse graph of only 160 feature nodes such that efficient inference in this graph produces state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging action recognition datasets. The nodes of our graph are semantic supervoxels that capture the spatiotemporal structure of objects and motion cues in the video. while edges between nodes encode spatiotemporal relations and feature similarity. We demonstrate that a shallow network that interleaves graph convolution and graph pooling on this compact representation implements an effective mechanism of relational reasoning yielding strong recognition results on both Charades and Something-Something.,True,OT3Xk68AAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,1,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Wang_Supervoxel_Attention_Graphs_for_Long-Range_Video_Modeling_WACV_2021_paper.html,6636565008237580161,/scholar?cites=6636565008237580161,,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Wang_Supervoxel_Attention_Graphs_for_Long-Range_Video_Modeling_WACV_2021_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Identifying miRNA targets is one of the core challenges in studying miRNA function. Previous miRNA target prediction algorithms are mainly based on physical interaction mechanism such as sequence match and free energy. In our paper. we proposed SVM ensemble classifier based method to integrate functional information from Gene Ontology with sequence information. To supplement our method. we constructed comprehensive positive data and high quality negative data from micro-array data. Performance evaluation shows significant improvement of the proposed method in both prediction performance and the coverage of miRNA-mRNA pairs.

While if we talk about interoperability today. we will certainly mention Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). Still. it does not mean that OAI-PMH could “replace“ Z39.50. because each of those has its own area of application which only partially overlap. Z39.50 is very sophisticated (and demanding) standard which enables distributed or “broadcasting“ searching. It means that information query is simultaneously sent from one place to multiple databases. On the other hand. interoperability concept which is enabled by OAI-PMH is based on metadata harvesting mechanism. OAI-PMH divides the world on “data providers“ and “service providers “. Data providers expose metadata about materials they contain. while service providers harvest those metadata. organize them and build new services on top of them. Metadata schema that OAI-PMH requires as obligatory is Dublin Core Metadata Element Set (coded in XML). but other metadata schemas employment is also possible (and suggested). The protocol itself is easily implemented and “low-barrier “. Originally. it is born in the context of reforming scholarly communication. Interoperability in the network of eprint archives needed to be established.

We present an image inpainting method that is based on the celebrated generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. The proposed PGGAN method includes a discriminator network that combines a global GAN (G-GAN) architecture with a patchGAN approach. PGGAN first shares network layers between G-GAN and patchGAN. then splits paths to produce two adversarial losses that feed the generator network in order to capture both local continuity of image texture and pervasive global features in images.

However. most of the existing inpainting networks introduce undesired artifacts and noise to the repaired regions. To solve this problem. we present a novel framework which consists of two stacked convolutional neural networks that inpaint the image and remove the artifacts. respectively. The first network considers the global structure of the damaged image and coarsely fills the blank area. Then the second network modifies the repaired image to cancel the noise introduced by the first network. The proposed framework splits the problem into two distinct partitions that can be optimized separately. therefore it can be applied to any inpainting algorithm by changing the first network. Second stage in our framework which aims at polishing the inpainted images can be treated as a denoising problem where a wide range of algorithms can be employed.

The requirement of processing the surveillance videos in real-time makes this more challenging. In this work. we propose a real-time online system to perform activity detection on untrimmed surveillance videos. The proposed system consists of three stages: first we detect tubelets with activities. then classify them. and finally merge them to generate spatio-temporal activity detections. We propose a localization network which takes a video clip as input and makes use of feature pyramid. multi-layer loss. and atrous convolutions to address the issue of multiple scales and detect small activities in terms of tubelets. The online processing of videos at a clip level drastically reduces the computation time in detecting activities. The detected tubelets are assigned activity class scores and merged together using our proposed Tubelet-Merge Action-Split (TMAS) algorithm to form action tubes. The TMAS algorithm efficiently connects the tubelets in an online fashion to generate spatio-temporal detections which are robust against varying length activities. We perform our experiments on the DIVA (Deep Intermodal Video Analytics) dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of speed (⇠ 100 fps) and performance with state-of-the-art results.

1281586,TinyVIRAT: low-resolution video action recognition,2020,Ugur Demir and Yogesh S Rawat and Mubarak Shah,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.07355,,,,The existing research in action recognition is mostly focused on high-quality videos where the action is distinctly visible. In real-world surveillance environments. the actions in videos are captured at a wide range of resolutions. Most activities occur at a distance with a small resolution and recognizing such activities is a challenging problem. In this work. we focus on recognizing tiny actions in videos. We introduce a benchmark dataset. TinyVIRAT. which contains natural low-resolution activities. The actions in TinyVIRAT videos have multiple labels and they are extracted from surveillance videos which makes them realistic and more challenging. We propose a novel method for recognizing tiny actions in videos which utilizes a progressive generative approach to improve the quality of low-resolution actions. The proposed method also consists of a weakly trained attention mechanism which helps in focusing on the activity regions in the video. We perform extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed TinyVIRAT dataset and observe that the proposed method significantly improves the action recognition performance over baselines. We also evaluate the proposed approach on synthetically resized action recognition datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results when compared with existing methods.

There have been several attempts to use gradient-based attribution methods to localize pathology from medical scans without using segmentation labels. This research direction has been impeded by the lack of robustness and reliability. These methods are highly sensitive to the network parameters. In this study. we introduce a robust visual explanation method to address this problem for medical applications. We provide a highly innovative algorithm to quantifying lesions in the lungs caused by the Covid-19 with high accuracy and robustness without using dense segmentation labels. Inspired by the information bottleneck concept. we mask the neural network representation with noise to find out important regions. This approach overcomes the drawbacks of commonly used Grad-Cam and its derived algorithms. The premise behind our proposed strategy is that the information flow is minimized while ensuring the classifier prediction stays similar.

1281598,Leveraging distant supervision for improved named entity recognition,2020,Abbas Ghaddar,,,,,,Recent years have seen a leap in deep learning techniques that greatly changed the way Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks are tackled. In a couple of years. neural networks and word embeddings quickly became central components to be adopted in the domain.   Distant supervision (DS) is a well-used technique in NLP to produce labeled data from partially annotated examples. Traditionally. it was mainly used as training data in the absence of manual annotations. or as additional training data to improve generalization performances.   In this thesis. we study how distant supervision can be employed within a modern deep learning based NLP framework. As deep learning algorithms gets better when massive amount of data is provided (especially for representation learning). we revisit the task of generating distant supervision data from Wikipedia. We apply post-processing treatments on the original dump to further increase the quantity of labeled examples. while introducing a reasonable amount of noise.    Then. we explore different methods for using distant supervision data for representation learning. mainly to learn classic and contextualized word representations. Due to its importance as a basic component in many NLP applications. we choose Named-Entity Recognition (NER) as our main task. We experiment on standard NER benchmarks showing state-of-the-art performances.

Given no available measurement training samples. we creatively utilize the motion capture database as an auxiliary and adapt its interior knowledge to the measurement data set. To achieve domain-invariant features. three types of features are extracted and fused including low-level deep features from the convolutional neural network. empirical features. and …,True,mwnoybEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8497048/,7683476829982957163,/scholar?cites=7683476829982957163,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Qing_Wang124/publication/328372622_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_for_Micro-Doppler_Human_Motion_Classification_via_Feature_Fusion/links/5f35159792851cd302f1607a/Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-for-Micro-Doppler-Human-Motion-Classification-via-Feature-Fusion.pdf,0,0,0
1281628,Micro-Doppler spectrogram denoising based on generative adversarial network,2018,Danyang Huang and Chunping Hou and Yang Yang and Yue Lang and Qing Wang,,,,909-912,IEEE,In applications based on radar sensors. target movement can be analyzed using micro-Doppler spectrogram. which is a time-frequency representation of micro-Doppler signature. However. the noise in spectrogram brings difficulties for applications. Conventional denoising algorithms are not specific to micro- Doppler data. they could only deal with a fixed level of noise and fail to effectively denoise under low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) circumstances. To overcome the drawbacks. we propose a method based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to remove the noise in micro-Doppler spectrograms. Our method is applicable to a wide range of noise intensity. for which can be called a blind denoiser. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on both simulated and measured data. experimental results compared with competing algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our method.,True,mwnoybEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,9,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8541507/,938970443298562599,/scholar?cites=938970443298562599,,,,0,0,0

However. since Doppler signatures are easily affected by the moving direction of the target. prior information of aspect angle is essential for spectral analysis. Thus. a micro-Doppler-based classifier is considered to be “angle-sensitive.” In this article. we propose an angle-insensitive classifier for the omnidirectional classification problem using the monostatic radar through a proposed new convolutional neural network. We further provide a sensible definition of “angle sensitivity.” and perform experiments on two data sets obtained through simulations and measurements.

Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations,1/2,123,,Due to the diversity of the image content. we propose in this study a new technique for content-based image retrieval to characterise the image. In this scenario. all images are characterised by their frequency content and their shape information. Indeed. using the high-resolution spectral analysis methods. especially the 2-D estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques. we extract from the image its content frequency and with the angular radial transform its shape information to construct a new vector descriptor. The experimental results applied to the Coil₁₀₀ database show the effectiveness and the robustness of our approach compared with the method based on the shame information only. and the precision average can be reached as 74.49.

1281651,Two new methods for image compression,2015,Khalid El Asnaoui and Youness Chawki,15,International Journal of Imaging and Robotics™,4,1-11,,The problem that we consider in this paper is about the compression of images in a large database. In this context. we propose two improved algorithms: The first is an improvement of the Block Truncation Coding method that overcomes the disadvantages of the classical Block Truncation Coding which uses sequential calculations. and the problem related to the processing of the original image borders. while the second describes how to obtain a new rank of SVD method. this one shows the new rank to approximate an image using the least amount of information. By comparing the performances of the two algorithms to several methods in state of the art. we will show that the first one presents several advantages; it is fast. reduces memory consuming and it doesnt require learning. The second method shows a better image compression.

We use both instance-aware semantic segmentation and sparse scene flow to classify objects as either background. moving. or potentially moving. thereby ensuring that the system is able to model objects with the potential to transition from static to dynamic. such as parked cars.

In this context. vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code. and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters. but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures). linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension). and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally. we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy.

1281670,Single-image blind deblurring for non-uniform camera-shake blur,2012,Yuquan Xu and Lu Wang and Xiyuan Hu and Silong Peng,,,,336-348,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,In this paper we address the problem of estimating latent sharp image and unknown blur kernel from a single motion-blurred image. The blur results from camera shake and is spatially variant. Meanwhile. the blur kernel of motion has three degrees of freedom. i.e.. translations and in-plane rotation. In order to solve this problem. we first analyzed the homography blur model for the non-uniform camera-shake blur.

In this paper. we consider the task of latent image restoration from a single depth-involved motion-blurred (DIMB) image. To easily describe the depth effect. we propose a new framework to model the image blur where the blur kernel is parameterized by the motion curve of the camera and depth value of the scene.

We adopt the particle swarm optimization algorithm to perform the sensor registration and the vehicle localization. The registration of the GPS sensor and the stereo camera is performed to increase the robustness of the vehicle localization algorithm. In the standard GPS-based vehicle localization. the algorithm is affected by noisy GPS signals in certain environmental conditions. We can address this problem through the sensor fusion or registration of the GPS and stereo camera. The sensors are registered by estimating the coordinate transformation matrix.

However. it is often unavoidable in practice both in non-blind and blind image deblurring. due to the error on the input kernel and the outliers in the blurry image. Without proper handing these outliers. the recovered image estimated by previous methods will suffer severe artifacts. In this paper. we mainly deal with two kinds of non-Gaussian noise in the image deblurring process. inaccurate kernel and compressed blurry image. and find that handling the noise as Laplacian distribution can get more robust result in these cases. Based on this point. the new non-blind and blind image deblurring algorithms are proposed to restore the clear image.

Authors have often raised concerns about their lack in scientific publications to improve the quality of the field. Recently. the graph representation learning field has attracted the attention of a wide research community. which resulted in a large stream of works. As such. several Graph Neural Network models have been developed to effectively tackle graph classification. However. experimental procedures often lack rigorousness and are hardly reproducible.

1281693,Testing Neural Program Analyzers,2019,Md Rafiqul Islam Rabin and Ke Wang and Mohammad Amin Alipour,,34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (Late Breaking Research-Track),,,,Deep neural networks have been increasingly used in software engineering and program analysis tasks. They usually take a program and make some predictions about it. eg. bug prediction. We call these models neural program analyzers. The reliability of neural programs can impact the reliability of the encompassing analyses. In this paper. we describe our ongoing efforts to develop effective techniques for testing neural programs. We discuss the challenges involved in developing such tools and our future plans. In our preliminary experiment on a neural model recently proposed in the literature. we found that the model is very brittle. and simple perturbations in the input can cause the model to make mistakes in its prediction.,True,zWB5QnwAAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10711,18058257213517834963,/scholar?cites=18058257213517834963,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10711,0,0,0

Compilers are complex software systems due to the complexity of optimization. GCC is an optimizing C compiler that has been used in building operating systems and many other system software. In this paper. we describe K-CONFIG. an approach that uses the bugs reported in the GCC repository to generate new test inputs. Our main insight is that the features appearing in the bug reports are likely to reappear in the future bugs. as the bugfixes can be incomplete or those features may be inherently challenging to implement hence more prone to errors. Our approach first clusters the failing test input extracted from the bug reports into clusters of similar test inputs. It then uses these clusters to create configurations for Csmith. the most popular test generator for C compilers. In our experiments on two versions of GCC. our approach could trigger up to 36 miscompilation failures. and 179 crashes. while Csmith with the default configuration did not trigger any failures. This work signifies the benefits of analyzing and using the reported bugs in the generation of new test inputs.,True,zWB5QnwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10481,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10481,0,0,0

Sun,19,Sensors,9,2160,MDPI,It is challenging for engineers to timely identify illegal ground intrusions in underground systems such as subways. In order to prevent the catastrophic collapse of subway tunnels from intrusion events. this paper investigated the capability of detecting the ground intrusion of underground structures based on dynamic measurement of distributed fiber optic sensing. For an actual subway tunnel monitored by the ultra-weak fiber optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensing fiber with a spatial resolution of five meters. a simulated experiment of the ground intrusion along the selected path was designed and implemented. in which a hydraulic excavator was chosen to exert intrusion perturbations with different strengths and modes at five selected intrusion sites. For each intrusion place. the distributed vibration responses of sensing fibers mounted on the tunnel wall and the track bed were detected to identify the occurrence and characteristics of the intrusion event simulated by the discrete and continuous pulses of the excavator under two loading postures. By checking the on-site records of critical moments in the intrusion process. the proposed detection approach based on distributed structural vibration responses for the ground intrusion can detect the occurrence of intrusion events. locate the intrusion ground area. and distinguish intrusion strength and typical perturbation modes.

One challenge is to find a reliable methodology that would enable these two needs to be addressed with high sensitivity and spatial resolution over a long-distance range. This paper proposes a novel monitoring approach based on distributed vibration. which is suitable for both train tracking and incursion detection. For an actual subway system. ultra-weak fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technology was applied to collect the distributed vibration responses from moving trains and intruders. The monitoring data from the subway operation stage were directly utilized to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method for tracking trains. Moreover. a field simulation experiment was performed to validate the possibility of detecting human intrusion. The results showed that the diagonal signal pattern in the distributed vibration response can be used to reveal the location and speed of the moving loads (eg. train and intruders). Other train parameters. such as length and the number of compartments. can also be obtained from the vibration responses through cross-correlation and envelope processing. Experimental results in the time and frequency domains within the selected intrusion range indicated that the proposed method can distinguish designed intrusion cases in terms of strength and mode.

Geometric features of triangular patches were employed as design variables to enable the representation of shell-like members and beam or bar members with a small number of design components. The minimum thickness for mean compliance minimization problems can be controlled simply by setting the lower bound of thickness variables of the patches as the given minimum. Regarding the maximum thickness. the patches with close-to-maximum thicknesses were controlled to be connected on their sides or perfectly overlapped. for which a void mask is introduced on each patch. avoiding partial overlapping through their faces. Thus. the maximum thickness of a member was obtained as the maximum value of thickness variables of the patches consisting of the member.

1281716,Explicit topology optimization of nearly incompressible materials using polytopal composite elements,2020,Van-Nam Hoang and Hoang B Nguyen and H Nguyen-Xuan,149,Advances in Engineering Software,,102903,Elsevier,In this paper. an efficient explicit topology optimization approach to nearly incompressible materials was proposed. The crucial idea is based on a smooth projection of discrete moving morphable bars (MMBs) onto an analytical grid of polytopal composite finite elements (PCEs). The PCEs. which are built with piecewise linear shape functions and assumed strain fields. aim to mitigate the inherent volumetric locking issue and accurately model nearly incompressible materials. Unlike most existing techniques that use the mixed displacement-pressure formulation and conventional topology optimization. the current method is based on the pure displacement formulation and explicit topology optimization with only hundreds of design variables.

In this study. an explicit topology optimization approach is proposed by moving polygonal morphable voids whose geometry parameters are considered as design variables. Methods: Each polygonal void plays as an empty-material zone that can move. change its shapes. and overlap with its neighbors in a design space. The geometry parameters of MPMVs consisting of the coordinates of polygonal vertices are utilized to render the structure in the design domain in an element density field. The density function of the elements located inside polygonal voids is described by a smooth exponential function that allows utilizing gradient-based optimization solvers. Results & Conclusion: Compared with conventional topology optimization approaches. the MPMV approach uses fewer design variables. ensure mesh-independence solution without filtering techniques or perimeter constraints. Several numerical examples are solved to validate the efficiency of the MPMV approach.,True,Z0CnklwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,http://stdj.scienceandtechnology.com.vn/index.php/stdj/article/view/2067,17267044934888276555,/scholar?cites=17267044934888276555,,,http://stdj.scienceandtechnology.com.vn/index.php/stdj/article/download/2067/2752,0,0,0

However. in practice. quantities such as positions. weights. and directions of applied loads may change accidentally. Deterministic load-based designs might deliver poor structural performance under loading uncertainties. Such uncertain factors need to be taken into account in topological optimization to seek robust results.

Current context based segmentation methods differ with each other in how to construct context features and perform differently in practice. This paper firstly introduces three desirable properties of context features in segmentation task. Specially. we find that Global-guided Local Affinity (GLA) can play a vital role in constructing effective context features. while this property has been largely ignored in previous works.

APCNet adaptively constructs multi-scale contextual representations with multiple well-designed Adaptive Context Modules (ACMs). Specifically. each ACM leverages a global image representation as a guidance to estimate the local affinity coefficients for each sub-region. and then calculates a context vector with these affinities.

Previous works construct multi-scale representation by utilizing different filter sizes. expanding filter sizes with dilated filters or pooling grids. and the parameters of these filters are fixed after training.

To address these problems. this paper proposes a Dynamic Multi-scale Network (DMNet) to adaptively capture multi-scale contents for predicting pixel-level semantic labels.

1281734,Learning Discriminative Representation For Facial Expression Recognition From Uncertainties,2020,Xingyu Fan and Zhongying Deng and Kai Wang and Xiaojiang Peng and Yu Qiao,,,,903-907,IEEE,Recent progresses on Facial Expression Recognition (FER) heavily rely on deep learning models trained with large scale datasets. However. large-scale facial expression datasets always suffer from annotation uncertainties caused by ambiguous expressions. low-quality facial images. and the subjectiveness of annotators. which limits FER performance. To address this challenge. this paper introduces novel Rayleigh and weighted-softmax loss from two aspects. First. we propose Rayleigh loss to extract discriminative representation. which aims at minimizing within-class distances and maximizing inter-class distances simultaneously. Moreover. Rayleigh loss has a Euclidean form which make it easily be optimized with SGD and be combined with other forms. Second. we introduce a weight to measure the uncertainty of a given sample. by considering its distance to class center.

Former methods have proposed various ways of target state estimation. yet few of them took the particularity of the visual tracking problem itself into consideration. Based on a careful analysis. we propose a set of practical guidelines of target state estimation for high-performance generic object tracker design. Following these guidelines. we design our Fully Convolutional Siamese tracker++(SiamFC++) by introducing both classification and target state estimation branch (G1). classification score without ambiguity (G2). tracking without prior knowledge (G3). and estimation quality score (G4). Extensive analysis and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines. Without bells and whistles. our SiamFC++ tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks (OTB2015. VOT2018. LaSOT. GOT-10k.

When there are a mixture of correct and mislabelled targets. networks tend to fit the former before the latter. This suggests using a suitable two-component mixture model as an unsupervised generative model of sample loss values during training to allow online estimation of the probability that a sample is mislabelled. Specifically. we propose a beta mixture to estimate this probability and correct the loss by relying on the network prediction (the so-called bootstrapping loss).

1281739,Towards Robust Learning with Different Label Noise Distributions,2019,Diego Ortego and Eric Arazo and Paul Albert and Noel E O'Connor and Kevin McGuinness,,International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR),,,,Noisy labels are an unavoidable consequence of labeling processes and detecting them is an important step towards preventing performance degradations in Convolutional Neural Networks. Discarding noisy labels avoids a harmful memorization. while the associated image content can still be exploited in a semi-supervised learning (SSL) setup. Clean samples are usually identified using the small loss trick. ie they exhibit a low loss. However. we show that different noise distributions make the application of this trick less straightforward and propose to continuously relabel all images to reveal a discriminative loss against multiple distributions. SSL is then applied twice. once to improve the clean-noisy detection and again for training the final model. We design an experimental setup based on ImageNet32/64 for better understanding the consequences of representation learning with differing label noise distributions and find that non-uniform out-of-distribution noise better resembles real-world noise and that in most cases intermediate features are not affected by label noise corruption. Experiments in CIFAR-10/100.

Most research to mitigate this memorization proposes new robust classification loss functions. Conversely. we explore the behavior of supervised contrastive learning under label noise to understand how it can improve image classification in these scenarios. In particular. we propose a Multi-Objective Interpolation Training (MOIT) approach that jointly exploits contrastive learning and classification. We show that standard contrastive learning degrades in the presence of label noise and propose an interpolation training strategy to mitigate this behavior. We further propose a novel label noise detection method that exploits the robust feature representations learned via contrastive learning to estimate per-sample soft-labels whose disagreements with the original labels accurately identify noisy samples. This detection allows treating noisy samples as unlabeled and training a classifier in a semi-supervised manner. We further propose MOIT+. a refinement of MOIT by fine-tuning on detected clean samples. Hyperparameter and ablation studies verify the key components of our method.

1281747,Modelling of alcohol detection using THz continuous wave ATR spectroscopy,2015,Eric Arazo Sánchez,,,,,Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya,The main objective of this work is the modelling of an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) cell for the detection of alcohols using terahertz (THz) spectroscopic techniques. As a first step. a model to simulate an ATR cell is built. It allows to distinguish alcohols from water. and one alcohol from another. The model has been tested simulating continuous wave spectroscopy with isopropanol. ethanol and water. Consequently. an overview of the main spectroscopic techniques used in THz studies is done in this work. To model the samples used in the simulation the Debye relaxation model is introduced. which describes the electric permittivity of the materials. As a result. the model built in this thesis. shows higher reflection of the THz radiation from the alcohols than from the water. Then the simulations have been compared with earlier studies. The results are consistent with the studies regarding to molecular sizes and reflection of the radiation. However. there are some mismatches when comparing precise values of the reflected field. Thus. a model to simulate the interaction of the ATR cell with the surrounding environment is proposed. Future lines have been written to improve the model with the aim to simulate the whole process of spectroscopy. By this way the simulation model can be built more close to the real nature of the reflection spectroscopy techniques.,True,0FJ5BQMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/79661,,,,,https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/79661/Eric_Arazo_Sanchez.pdf,0,0,0

However. tracking all landmarks of interest is a very challenging task. as severe self-occlusions of the animal and low contrast are present in the images due to the X-ray modality. For this reason. existing approaches are currently only applicable for very specific subsets of anatomical landmarks. In contrast. our goal is to present a holistic approach which models all anatomical landmarks in one consistent. probabilistic framework. While active appearance models (AAMs) provide a reasonable global modeling framework. they yield poor fitting results when applied on the full set of landmarks. In this paper. we propose to augment the AAM fitting process by imposing constraints from various sources. We derive a general probabilistic fitting approach and show how results of subset AAMs. local tracking. anatomical knowledge. and epipolar constraints can be included. The evaluation of our approach is based on 32 real-world datasets of five bird species which contain 175.942 ground-truth landmark positions provided by human experts. We show that our method clearly outperforms standard AAM fitting …,True,B58vq_cAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,6,https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-5281-2013-45,4067774725605735469,/scholar?cites=4067774725605735469,,,https://jivp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-5281-2013-45,0,0,0

Important applications include the parameter estimation of locomotion models. the discrimination of gaits. or the calculation of mechanical work during locomotion. Several methods exist to approximate the CoM position. e.g. force-plate-based approaches. kinematic approaches. or the reaction board method. However. they all share the drawback of not being suitable for large scale studies. as detailed initial conditions from kinematics are required (force-plates). manual interaction is necessary (kinematic approach). or only static settings can be analyzed (reaction board). For the increasingly popular case of X-ray-based animal locomotion analysis. we present an alternative approach for CoM estimation which overcomes these shortcomings. The main idea is to only use the recorded X-ray …,True,B58vq_cAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,6,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002192901300273X,17582306548040740945,/scholar?cites=17582306548040740945,,,,0,0,0

In medical applications such as the therapy of a facial paralysis. automatically finding the activation intensity of each AU is of main interest. In this medical application context. existing works feature several drawbacks. For instance. the majority of approaches concentrates on analyzing the presence or absence of AUs instead of finding their underlying activation levels. For facial feature extraction. Active Appearance Models (AAMs) are often used. While all current AAM-based studies rely on derived redundant high-dimensional features. we propose to use a compact low-dimensional representation.

To analyze the motion. high-speed x-ray sequences of walking animals are recorded. The biological evaluation is based on anatomical key points in the images. and the goal is to find these landmarks automatically. Unfortunately. low contrast and occlusions in the images drastically complicate this task. As recently shown. Active Appearance Models (AAMs) can be successfully applied to this problem. However. obtaining reliable quantitative results is a tedious task. as the human error is unknown. In this work. we present the results of a large scale study which allows us to quantify both the tracking performance of humans as well as AAMs. Furthermore. we show that the AAM-based approach provides results which are comparable to those of human experts.,True,B58vq_cAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,6,https://pub.inf-cv.uni-jena.de/pdf/Haase11:CEO.pdf,7878500892884348146,/scholar?cites=7878500892884348146,,,https://pub.inf-cv.uni-jena.de/pdf/Haase11:CEO.pdf,0,0,0
1281758,Fast and robust landmark tracking in x-ray locomotion sequences containing severe occlusions,2012,Manuel Amthor and Daniel Haase and Joachim Denzler,,,,,The Eurographics Association,Recent advances in the understanding of animal locomotion have proven it to be a key element of many fields in biology. motion science. and robotics. For the analysis of walking animals. high-speed x-ray videography is employed. For a biological evaluation of these x-ray sequences. anatomical landmarks have to be located in each frame. However. due to the motion of the animals. severe occlusions complicate this task and standard tracking methods can not be applied. We present a robust tracking approach which is based on the idea of dividing a template into sub-templates to overcome occlusions. The difference to other sub-template approaches is that we allow soft decisions for the fusion of the single hypotheses. which greatly benefits tracking stability. Also. we show how anatomical knowledge can be included into the tracking process to further improve the performance.

However. preserving tracker robustness against challenging scenarios with real-time speed is a primary concern for visual object tracking. Siamese trackers confront difficulties handling target appearance changes continually due to less discrimination ability learning between target and background information. This paper presents stacked channel-spatial attention within Siamese networks to improve tracker robustness without sacrificing fast-tracking speed. The proposed channel attention strengthens target-specific channels increasing their weight while reducing the importance of irrelevant channels with lower weights.

However. it is still difficult for Siamese models to adapt the target variations from offline learning. In this paper. we introduced an Adaptive Feature Selection Siamese (AFS-Siam) network to learn the most discriminative feature information for better tracking. Features from different layers contain complementary information for discrimination. Proposed adaptive feature selection module selects the most useful feature information from different convolutional layers while suppresses the irrelevant ones.

Tracking desired objects in challenging scenarios is still one of the fundamental concerns during visual tracking. This research paper proposes a feature refined end-to-end tracking framework with real-time tracking speed and considerable performance. The feature refine network has been incorporated to enhance the target feature representation power. utilizing high-level semantic information. Besides. it allows the network to capture the salient information to locate the target and learns to represent the target feature in a more generalized way advancing the overall tracking performance. particularly in the challenging sequences. But. only the feature refine module is unable to handle such challenges because of its less discriminative ability. To overcome this difficulty. we employ an attention module inside the feature refine network that strengths the tracker discrimination ability between the target and background.
