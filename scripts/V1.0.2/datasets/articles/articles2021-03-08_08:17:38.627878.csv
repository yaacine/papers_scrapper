1157573,Catalytic direct arylation with aryl chlorides. bromides. and iodides: intramolecular studies leading to new intermolecular reactions,2006,Louis-Charles Campeau and Mathieu Parisien and Annie Jean and Keith Fagnou,128,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2,581-590,American Chemical Society,A catalyst for the intramolecular direct arylation of a broad range of simple and heterocyclic arenes with aryl iodides. bromides. and chlorides has been developed. These reactions occur in excellent yield and are highly selective. Studies with aryl iodides substrates revealed that catalyst poisoning occurs due to the accumulation of iodide in the reaction media. This can be overcome by the addition of silver salts which also permits these reactions to occur at lower temperature. The utility of the methodology is illustrated by a rapid synthesis of a carbazole natural product and by the synthesis of sterically encumbered tetra-ortho-substituted biaryls via ring-opening reactions of the direct arylation products. Mechanistic investigations have provided insight into the catalyst's mode of action and show the presence of a kinetically significant C−H bond cleavage in palladium-catalyzed direct arylation of simple arenes …,True,nSWEqSgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,678,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja055819x,5705504055639657100,/scholar?cites=5705504055639657100,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathieu_Parisien/publication/7368805_Catalytic_Direct_Arylation_with_Aryl_Chlorides_Bromides_and_Iodides_Intramolecular_Studies_Leading_to_New_Intermolecular_Reactions/links/5e1f018c4585150583a58c52/Catalytic-Direct-Arylation-with-Aryl-Chlorides-Bromides-and-Iodides-Intramolecular-Studies-Leading-to-New-Intermolecular-Reactions.pdf,0,0,0

1157584,Reaction to the NHL Salary Cap,2017,Mathieu Parisien,,,,,,On February 16th. 2005. the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman officially announced the cancelation of the 2004-2005 NHL season. The cancelation was due to dead end negotiations for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NHL Players Associations (NHLPA) and the NHL. The main issues surrounding the negotiations were the subject of league revenue distributions and team salary structure. On July 22nd. 2005. a new CBA was reached. The biggest impact the new CBA would have is the introduction of a salary cap ceiling as well as a salary cap floor. This study focuses on these new salary cap restrictions and how it has affected the distribution of player salaries across the NHL. We analyse league statistics and player salaries from the 2000-2001 season to the 2011-2012 season. to identify how teams adjusted their strategies to accommodate for to the salary cap. The study focuses on budget variation among teams. salary distribution within teams. as well as changes in team construction. The results of this research will provide insight for the optimum strategy of salary distribution to be able to construct a successful hockey team within the NHL.The world of professional sports has been used at times to shed light on important labour market research questions such as estimating the effect of employer monopsony on wages. investigating the extent of racial discrimination (eg Price and Wolfers (2010)). investigating the relevance of important theorems in economics (eg. the Coase Theorem in Fort and Quirk (1995)). and estimating the effect of supervision and incentives on worker performance (Kahn. 2000).

Aryl chlorides. bromides and iodides could all be used and the methodology was applied to the synthesis of 6H-benzo[c]chomenes; 9. 10-dihydrophenanthenes; 5. 6-dihydrophenanthridines (if the nitrogen atom was protected) with yields ranging between 79% - >99%. Fluorene. dibenzofurans and carbazoles (unprotected NH) could also be formed in high yields (81%- 99%) using this technique. It has been found that both electronic and steric factors influence the regioselectivity of the reaction. Furthermore. mechanistic investigations have been conducted to establish which one of four possible pathways is taking place. The results of these experiments point towards either a sigma-bond metathesis or an SE3 palladation. The methodology described above was applied to the synthesis of natural products.

Some of them are exerted through its specific membrane receptors type 1 and type 2 (MT1 and MT2) while others are mediated by receptor-independent mechanisms. A potential transport of melatonin through facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT/SLC2A) was proposed in prostate cancer cells. The prostate cells have a particular metabolism that changes during tumor progression. During the first steps of carcinogenesis. oxidative phosphorylation is reactivated while the switch to the “Warburg effect” only occurs in advanced tumors and in the metastatic stage. Here. we investigated whether melatonin might change prostate cancer cell metabolism. To do so. 13 C stable isotope-resolved metabolomics in androgen sensitive LNCaP and insensitive PC-3 prostate cancer cells were employed. In addition to metabolite 13 C-labeling. ATP/AMP levels. and lactate dehydrogenase or pentose phosphate pathway activity were measured. Melatonin reduces lactate labeling in androgen-sensitive cells and it also lowers 13 C-labeling of tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and ATP production.

Although there are some reports concerning low-molecular-weight polyphenols in U. tomentosa. its polymeric phenolic composition has been scarcely studied. In this study. phenolic-rich extracts from leaves. stems. bark and wood (n= 14) of Uncaria tomentosa plants from several regions of Costa Rica were obtained and analysed in respect to their proanthocyanidin profile determined by a quadrupole-time-of-flight analyser (ESI-QTOF MS). Main structural characteristics found for U. tomentosa proanthocyanidins were:(a) monomer composition. including pure procyanidins (only composed of (epi) catechin units) and propelargonidins (only composed of (epi) afzelechin units) as well as mixed proanthocyanidins; and (b) degree of polymerization. from 3 up to 11 units. In addition. U. tomentosa phenolic extracts were found to exhibit reasonable antioxidant capacity (ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) values between 1.5 and 18.8 mmol TE/g) and antimicrobial activity against potential respiratory pathogens (minimum IC 50 of 133 µg/mL). There were also found to be particularly cytotoxic to gastric adenocarcinoma AGS and colon adenocarcinoma SW620 cell lines. The results state the particularities of U. tomentosa proanthocyanidins and suggest the potential value of these extracts with prospective use as functional ingredients.

N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine. is an indole mainly synthesized from tryptophan in the pineal gland and secreted exclusively during the night in all the animals reported to date. While the pineal gland is the major source responsible for this night rise. it is not at all the exclusive production site and many other tissues and organs produce melatonin as well. Likewise. melatonin is not restricted to vertebrates. as its presence has been reported in almost all the phyla from protozoa to mammals. Melatonin displays a large set of functions including adaptation to light: dark cycles. free radical scavenging ability. antioxidant enzyme modulation. immunomodulatory actions or differentiation–proliferation regulatory effects. among others. However. in addition to those important functions. this evolutionary ‘ancient’molecule still hides further tools with important cellular implications. The major goal of the present review is to discuss the data and experiments that have addressed the relationship between the indole and glucose. Classically. the pineal gland and a pinealectomy were associated with glucose homeostasis even before melatonin was chemically isolated. Numerous reports have provided the molecular components underlying the regulatory actions of melatonin on insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. mainly involving membrane receptors MTNR1A/B. which would be partially responsible for the circadian rhythmicity of insulin in the organism. More recently. a new line of evidence has shown that glucose transporters GLUT/SLC2A are linked to melatonin uptake and its cellular internalization.

However occasionally. the indoleamine has been reported to increase free radicals with insufficient mechanistic explanation. In an attempt to find a reason for those controversial results. a potential mechanism that explains MEL prooxidant activity is investigated. The current controversy about redox detection methods has prompted us to search a possible interaction between MEL and dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH2). perhaps the most widely fluorescence probe employed for free radicals detection in cellular models. Here. it is demonstrated that melatonin potentiates the photooxidation of DCFH2 in a cell-free system. increasing the production of its fluorescent metabolite. Indeed. MEL works as an antioxidant scavenging hydroxyl radicals in this system. Thus. this reaction between MEL and DCFH2 produces N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK). a biogenic amine with antioxidant properties too. This reaction is O2 and light dependent and it is prevented by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine or ascorbic acid. Furthermore. when DCFH2 has been employed to evaluate antioxidant or prooxidant activities of MEL in cellular models it is confirmed that it works as an antioxidant but these results can be modulated by light misleading to a prooxidant conclusion. In conclusion. here is demonstrated that DCFH2. light and melatonin interact and results obtained using these fluorescence probes in studies with melatonin have to be carefully interpreted.,True,9vyQllMAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,13,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109257,18006879495475866207,/scholar?cites=18006879495475866207,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109257,0,0,0

In the DHP−P−C60 form of the triad. excitation of the porphyrin moiety is followed by photoinduced electron transfer to give a DHP−P•+−C60•- charge-separated state. which evolves by a charge shift reaction to DHP•+−P−C60•-. This final state has a lifetime of 2 μs and is formed in an overall yield of 94%. Visible (≥300 nm) irradiation of the triad leads to photoisomerization of the DHP moiety to the cyclophanediene (CPD). Excitation of the porphyrin moiety of CPD−P−C60 produces a short-lived (<10 ns) CPD−P•+−C60•- state. but charge shift to the CPD moiety does not occur. due to the relatively high oxidation potential of the CPD group.

The sensor shows a remarkable detection limit of 57 nM for Al3+ which is among one of the lowest reported so far.,True,NouYBgsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,12,https://pubs.rsc.org/az/content/articlehtml/2013/ra/c3ra42043d,7688608097267275327,/scholar?cites=7688608097267275327,,https://pubs.rsc.org/az/content/articlehtml/2013/ra/c3ra42043d,0,0,0
