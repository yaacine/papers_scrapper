The objective of this was to assess the effect of ligand exchanged ZIF-71 on the performance of ZIF-71/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) for removal of alcohol from dilute aqueous solutions. Both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy confirmed the exchange of the new ligands into the ZIF-71 material. The 1H NMR spectra demonstrated the molar ratios of the ligand-exchange into the ZIF-71 particles.

From early attempts based on free volume and cohesive energy to more recent group contribution methods. the ability to predict membrane permeability has improved in terms of accuracy.

Cycloaddition of ethylene and 2.5-dimethylfuran and subsequent dehydration to p-xylene has been achieved with 75% selectivity using H–Y zeolite and an aliphatic solvent at 300 °C. Competitive side reactions include hydrolysis of dimethylfuran to 2.5-hexanedione. alkylation of p-xylene. and polymerization of 2.5-hexanedione. The observed reaction rates and computed energy barriers are consistent with a two-step reaction that proceeds through a bicyclic adduct prior to dehydration to p-xylene. Cycloaddition of ethylene and dimethylfuran occurs without a catalytic active site. but the reaction is promoted by confinement within microporous materials.

Here. we show that hydrophobic zeolite beta with framework tin or titanium Lewis acid centers isomerizes sugars. e.g.. glucose. via reaction pathways that are analogous to those of metalloenzymes. Specifically. experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that glucose partitions into the zeolite in the pyranose form. ring opens to the acyclic form in the presence of the Lewis acid center. isomerizes into the acyclic form of fructose. and finally ring closes to yield the furanose product. The zeolite catalysts provide processing advantages over metalloenzymes such as an ability to work at higher temperatures and in acidic conditions that allow for the isomerization reaction to be coupled with other important conversions.,True,xScC6yUAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,329,https://www.pnas.org/content/109/25/9727.short,12081363377659122480,/scholar?cites=12081363377659122480,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2012/05/31/1206708109.full.pdf,0,0,0

CO2 capture can be performed by using amine-based solvents to absorb the CO2. but these processes are energy intensive. They could reduce the energy output of a power plant by 25–40%[2] and are not cost-effective for carbon emission reduction. Solid physical adsorption technologies for CO2 capture have significant advantages in terms of energy efficiency compared with chemical absorption approaches. Specifically. the adsorptiondriven pressure or vacuum swing (PSA/VSA) processes are promising as efficient means for the capture and separation of CO2 because of their low energy requirement and fast regeneration.[3–5] In the application of physical adsorbents it is necessary to balance a strong affinity for the undesired component with the energy consumption required for the adsorbent regeneration. For flue gas separation. VSA is considered more promising than regular PSA because it avoids the high cost of flue gas pressurization.[6]The choice of adsorbents is the most crucial consideration for the design of a separation process. To effectively separate the diluted CO2 from the flue gas. adsorbents must fulfill a number of criteria including high CO2 working capacity in the operating pressure window. high selectivity of CO2 over N2. high regenerability. and low pressure drop.

Typical commercial methane oxidation catalysts are alumina-supported palladium catalysts. When operated at low temperatures. these catalysts exhibit rapid deactivations on stream due to water inhibition [1]. In addition. these Pd-catalysts are sensitive to sulfur poisoning. even with the presence of a trace amount (≤ 1 ppm) of SO2 in the feed [2]. Among other oxide materials. zeolites were also investigated as a potential support for palladium–such as the effects of frameworks [3] and exchange or impregnation methods [4]–but no significant benefits were discovered comparing to conventional alumina-based catalysts [5].Here. we demonstrate the application of siliceous zeolites (ie SiO2-to-Al2O3 ratio (SAR)> 1200) as Pd-support. the resulting catalysts exhibit significantly improved activity and onstream durability at low temperatures. and are able to be regenerated from sulfur poisoning under realistic operating conditions.,True,g4jLXFgAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,0,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2017/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper14078/NAM25%20abstract_Pd.zeolite%20CNG_revised.pdf,,,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2017/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper14078/NAM25%20abstract_Pd.zeolite%20CNG_revised.pdf,0,0,0

It was found that. while the coating reduces capacity fading of the LiFePO4/Li cell. it imposes a deteriorating effect on the LiFePO4/C cell. Analyses on cell impedance and electrode surface morphology and composition showed that the oxide coating reduced Fe dissolution from the LiFePO4 cathode and hence alleviated the impedance increase associated with the erosion process. This leads to reduced capacity fading as observed for the LiFePO4/Li cell.

Zr-BEA (Si/Zr = 168) exhibited superior performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation. which was attributed to its low activity for the hydrolysis of DMF to 2.5-hexanedione and subsequent condensation.

In this paper. we detail the development of a novel specimen goniometer that allows real time observations of the mechanical response of materials to indentation loads. The technology of the scanning tunneling microscope is adopted to allow nanometer scale positioning of a sharp. conductive diamond tip onto the edge of an electron transparent sample. This allows application of loads to nanometer-scale material volumes couple with simultaneous imaging of the material response. The emphasis in this paper is experimental and descriptive. with particular attention given to sample geometry and other technical requirements.

The temperature change along the length of a nanotube is determined from the temperature-induced shifts in the G band Raman frequency. The spatial temperature profile reveals the ratio of the contact thermal resistance to the intrinsic thermal resistance of the nanotube.

Such anisotropic expansion is attributed to the interfacial processes of accommodating large volumetric strains at the lithiation reaction front that depend sensitively on the crystallographic orientation. This anisotropic swelling results in lithiated Si nanowires with a remarkable dumbbell-shaped cross section. which develops due to plastic flow and an ensuing necking instability that is induced by the tensile hoop stress buildup in the lithiated shell.

Tin‐based composites are one alternative approach. Nanosized Sn–Fe–C anode materials are mechanochemically synthesized by reducing SnO with Ti in the presence of carbon. The optimum synthesis conditions are found to be 1:0.25:10 for initial ratio of SnO. Ti. and graphite with a total grinding time of 8 h.

In many cases. research is driven by the development of novel instrumentation and testing methodologies. One key advantage that probing techniques have is control over when the experiment begins. For example. is possible to keep a material undeformed until contacted by a mechanical probe such as an indenter. Or. it is possible to keep a material in a pristine state until probed by a lensed fiber optic for near-field optical probing. This talk will present recent developments from a number of in situ TEM probing techniques. including mechanical. electromechanical and optical probing. In the field of nanomechanics. in situ TEM holders have progressed to the level that we can measure both strength and ductility through quantitative compression. tension or bending experiments. These tests can also be extended to cryogenic (-140C) or elevated (400C) temperature. By augmenting the mechanical probing capabilities to include electrical measurements. it is possible to probe the coupled electrical and mechanical properties of materials such as piezoelectric thin films and functional nanomaterials.

In particular. we design “invasive” probes crossing the whole graphene sheet as well as “external” probes connected through graphene side arms. The four-probe conductance measured between external probes varies linearly with charge density and is symmetric between electron and hole types of carriers. In contrast measurements with invasive probes give a strong electron-hole asymmetry and a sublinear conductance as a function of density. By comparing various geometries and types of contact metal. we show that these two observations are due to transport properties of the metal/graphene interface. The asymmetry originates from the pinning of the charge density below the metal. which thereby forms a p− n or p− p junction. depending on the polarity of the carriers in the bulk graphene sheet.

The main challenge of load following in SOFC systems is to operate them within the safe operating conditions. Transient operation of SOFC results in spatial temperature fluctuations. Such fluctuations can cause thermal fatigues that reduce efficiency and stack's lifetime. Consequently. controlling SOFC spatial temperature plays an important role in minimizing fuel cell …,True,7PPEJsMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,2,https://search.proquest.com/openview/f2e79077187e60ab4285b261a91af647/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y,7645811979094325261,/scholar?cites=7645811979094325261,,,0,0,0

Thermal management of the SOEC is achieved by use of heat from the SOFC with a heat exchanger network and control strategies. While the SOFC meets the building electricity demand and heat from its electrochemical reactions is transferred to the SOEC for endothermic heat and standby demands.

It appeared that the electrolyte undergoes high tensile stresses at the ends of the cell in limited areas and that the anode is submitted to moderate tensile stresses. A simplified version of the widely used Weibull analysis was used to calculate the global probability of survival for the assessment of the risks related to both operating points and load changes.

The first method considers the anode expansion above the electrolyte fracture limit by measuring the crack width in the electrolyte layer.

1135965,Crowdsourcing Sustainable Development Goals from Global Civil Society: A Content Analysis,2015,Joshua Chad Gellers,,Available at SSRN 2562122,,,,For the past several decades. members of global civil society have begun to play an increasing role in global environmental governance. Expanding participation in global decision making processes to include actors beyond the nation-state is viewed as a corrective for the democratic deficit that some argue continues to undermine the legitimacy of international institutions. Yet. important questions remain regarding how civil society should be incorporated into global policymaking. One recently implemented approach involves crowdsourcing comments through web-based platforms like e-discussions and social media. However. the viability of this approach and its implications for global governance have not been adequately assessed. In this paper. I evaluate the potential efficacy of crowdsourcing as a means of increasing participation in global environmental governance through an analysis of data from the global MY World survey and a content analysis of UN-initiated e-discussions surrounding the inclusion of environmental sustainability in the post-2015 development agenda. I find that there exists a perceptible demographic imbalance among contributors to the MY World survey and considerable dissonance between the characteristics of participants in the e-discussions and those whose voices were included in the resulting summary report. This suggests that although crowdsourcing may be an attractive tool for widening participation in global governance. ultimately the democratic quality of that participation depends on the manner in which contributions are filtered by international institutions.,True,vvnmhTIAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC,4,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2562122,2208041735462370535,/scholar?cites=2208041735462370535,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joshua_Gellers/publication/272088819_Crowdsourcing_Sustainable_Development_Goals_from_Global_Civil_Society_A_Content_Analysis/links/54da2fd10cf2970e4e7e4309.pdf,0,0,0

Animal and Environmental Law (Edition 1),2020,Joshua C Gellers,,,,,Routledge,Bringing a unique perspective to the burgeoning ethical and legal issues surrounding the presence of artificial intelligence in our daily lives. the book uses theory and practice on animal rights and the rights of nature to assess the status of robots.Through extensive philosophical and legal analyses. the book explores how rights can be applied to nonhuman entities. This task is completed by developing a framework useful for determining the kinds of personhood for which a nonhuman entity might be eligible. and a critical environmental ethic that extends moral and legal consideration to nonhumans. The framework and ethic are then applied to two hypothetical situations involving real-world technology—animal-like robot companions and humanoid sex robots. Additionally. the book approaches the subject from multiple perspectives. providing a comparative study of legal cases on animal rights and the rights of nature from around the world and insights from structured interviews with leading experts in the field of robotics. Ending with a call to rethink the concept of rights in the Anthropocene. suggestions for further research are made.An essential read for scholars and students interested in robot. animal and environmental law. as well as those interested in technology more generally. the book is a ground-breaking study of an increasingly relevant topic. as robots become ubiquitous in modern society.,True,vvnmhTIAAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC,3,https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/43332,16398986328046408907,/scholar?cites=16398986328046408907,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/43332/external_content.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Liberal scholars of international relations contend that the realist conception of security is unnecessarily limited. and call for the broadening of security to include concerns such as economic security. human security. and environmental security. However. is realism inherently incompatible with the concept of environmental security?

In this paper I seek to incorporate environmental security into the broader framework of realism by analyzing the extent to which environmental problems pose a threat to the survival of major states.

I conducted semi-structured interviews with academics. activists. and politicians in Kathmandu. Nepal during September 2012. The results from this study corroborate the main finding from my larger empirical study—the decision to include an environmental right in the constitution was greatly influenced by the presence of civil society organizations. However. I also discovered that the resulting environmental right was viewed by the activist community as a consolation prize for not having secured the right of local communities to manage their own natural resources.

Several NASA sponsored satellite missions provide valuable precipitation data. However. the advantages of the data are limited by complications related to the indirect nature of satellite estimates. This study intends to develop a stochastic model for uncertainty analysis of satellite rainfall fields through simulating error fields and imposing them over satellite estimates. In order to examine reliability and performance of the presented model. ensembles of satellite estimates are simulated for a large area across the North and South Carolina. The generated ensembles are then compared with original satellite estimates with respect to statistical properties and spatial dependencies. The results show that the model can be used to describe the uncertainties associated to TRMM multi-satellite precipitation estimates. The presented model is validated using random sub-samples of the observations based on the bootstrap technique.

Event probability can be estimated using the extreme value index (γ) which describes the behavior of the upper tail and measures the degree of extreme value clustering. In this paper. various semi-parametric and parametric extreme value index estimators are implemented in order to characterize the tail behavior of long-term daily rainfall time series.

Hurricanes result in extreme precipitation and flooding events. which pose a significant concern to the population and exert a major negative effect on the economic growth. Regional weather models are used to determine the potential of flooding based on model predicted rainfall. In particular. the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is a next-generation mesoscale modeling system designed to improve the weather forecasts. Choosing the right model configuration can help reducing the model uncertainty due to the complicated physic equations. which govern how the state of the system changes with time. The aim of this study is to investigate the model sensitivity to different microphysics configurations for extreme weather events. Furthermore. the uncertainty of hurricane path under different microphysics options is investigated. Hurricane Rita (2005). which resulted in severe damages to the Gulf Coast region. is selected as the case study.

Atomistic simulations predict that suitably substituted aprotic heterocyclic anions. or “AHAs.” bind CO2 with energies that can be controlled over a wide range suitable to gas separations. Further. unlike all previously known CO2-binding ILs. the AHA IL viscosity is predicted to be insensitive to CO2. Spectroscopic. temperature-dependent absorption. rheological. and calorimetric measurements on trihexyl(tetradecyl)-phosphonium 2-cyanopyrrolide ([P66614][2-CNpyr]) show CO2 uptakes close to prediction as well as insignificant changes in viscosity in the presence of CO2.

Pyrolysis of Zn-MOFs typically yields materials that retain the high surface area of the parent MOF while imparting mesoporosity due to carbothermal reduction and Zn evaporation. When non-Zn containing MOFs are used. significant loss in surface area and porosity after pyrolysis is observed. To overcome these limitations. a hierarchical microporous/mesoporous analogue of microporous MIL-125 (Ti) was synthesized and subjected to pyrolysis at various temperatures. By varying the pyrolysis temperature. both Ti content and phase in the final materials could be altered. The resulting materials exhibited enhanced mesoporosity and activity as catalysts in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene when compared to pyrolyzed microporous MIL-125. This increased activity was attributed to the greater mesoporosity …,True,a-fPzQYAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,36,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b01946,17604653765391561948,/scholar?cites=17604653765391561948,,,0,0,0

It is still unclear how field emission affects other fundamental plasma properties at this scale. In this work. a one-dimensional fluid model is used to predict basic scaling laws for fundamental properties including ion density. electric field due to space charge. and current-voltage relations in the pre-breakdown regime.

In this paper. we demonstrate unambiguous coherent and incoherent phonon transport in 12C/13C graphene superlattices using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Coherent phonon modes preserve their phases as they propagate through multiple interfaces. For these phonons. the superlattice can be treated as a homogeneous material with its own unit cell and phonon dispersion. We observe length-dependent thermal conductivity of the 12C/13C graphene superlattices. which indicates the existence of coherent phonons that transport ballistically over large distances.

In addition. NTP reactors are easily adaptable to gas phase catalytic packed bed reactors making these systems applicable to a wide range of reactions. Most of the success with plasma-assisted catalysis has been found in activating stable bonds. such as aliphatic CH bonds2 and CO2. 3 Specifically. plasma-assisted reactions have been shown to improve dry reforming. ammonia synthesis. and CO2 hydrogenation among other reactions. 4 Despite the study of various reactions. the mechanisms of the interactions between the plasma and the catalyst still remains relatively unknown.

In the presence of a catalyst. synergy between the catalyst and the plasma exists to assist in the activation of reactants to promote the chemical transformation. We have been particularly interested in the use of non-thermal plasmas for the catalytic production of ammonia from nitrogen/hydrogen gas mixtures. The industrial Haber-Bosch process for ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and hydrogen is carried out at high pressures (100-200 bar) and temperatures (400-500 °C). N2 dissociation is the fundamental barrier for this reaction. and plasma-catalysis has been suggested as viable way to activate N2 under ambient conditions.

For conduction at steady-state. thermal rectification can occur naturally in systems where the thermal conductivity of the material (s) varies in space and with temperature. However. in practical applications. rectification may often need to be controlled or understood under transient conditions. Using a bulk composite. specifically a two-slab composite. as a model system. we analyze transient rectifying behavior. We find that under some conditions transient rectification can be several times larger than steady-state rectification.

In addition. NTP reactors are easily adaptable to gas phase catalytic packed bed reactors making these systems applicable to a wide range of reactions. Most of the success with plasma-assisted catalysis has been found in activating stable bonds. such as aliphatic CH bonds2 and CO2. 3 Specifically. plasma-assisted reactions have been shown to improve dry reforming. ammonia synthesis. and CO2 hydrogenation among other reactions. 4 Despite the study of various reactions. the mechanisms of the interactions between the plasma and the catalyst still remains relatively unknown.

Experiments seem to produce conflicting results: optical and spin‐resonance techniques reveal strongly localized small polarons. while electrical measurements show high mobilities that can only be explained by delocalized free electrons. By means of hybrid functional calculations we resolve this apparent contradiction and show that small polarons can actually coexist with delocalized electrons in the conduction band of TiO2. the former being energetically only slightly more favorable. We also find that small polarons can form complexes with oxygen vacancies and ionized shallow‐donor impurities. explaining the rich spectrum of Ti3+ species observed in electron spin resonance experiments.

We report formation energies for the different charge states of Li. O and O2 vacancies in Li2O2 that could have important implications for charge transport through Li2O2. Charge transition levels are given as a function of the location of the Fermi level in Li2O2 relative to the valence band maximum (VBM). We argue that in Li–O2 discharge/charge electrochemistry. the Fermi level is pinned by LiO2 interface states at ∼0.35 eV above the VBM and this causes the vacancies to be in positively charged states (weakly violating local charge neutrality). We show by non-equilibrium Greens function calculations of charge transport through a Au|Li2O2 + VLiq |Au metal–insulator–metal structure (with VLiq a Li vacancy of charge state q). that the +1 and 0 charge state induces considerable scattering for tunneling holes.

Na2B12H12. and their closo-borate relatives exhibit unusually high ionic conductivity. making them attractive as a new class of candidate electrolytes in solid-state Li- and Na-ion batteries. However. further optimization of these materials requires a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying ultrafast ion conduction. To this end. we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and density-functional calculations to explore the motivations for cation diffusion. We find that superionic behavior in Li2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 results from a combination of key structural. chemical. and dynamical factors that introduce intrinsic frustration and disorder. A statistical metric is used to show that the structures exhibit a high density of accessible interstitial sites and site types. which correlates with the flatness of the energy landscape and the observed cation mobility.

The phase-dependent behavior is likely related to the higher structural stability of m s-BiVO 4 than t s-BiVO 4. which may suppress hole-induced lattice distortions.

In this work. we investigate Li+ kinetics at a prototypical interface between graphite anodes and an organic electrolyte. and we elucidate key factors that determine ion transport. using first-principles methodology coupling ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with a solvation model. We show that surface chemical composition significantly influences the kinetics of ion intercalation from the liquid into graphite.

In this case. the surface chemistry at the interface with liquid water differs significantly from that of gas-phase water adsorption due to the formation of strong. low-barrier hydrogen bonds between surface adsorbates and water molecules.

Predicting and controlling nucleation rates in solids is one of the grand challenges in materials science because the spatial scale involved in nucleation is at the atomic/nanoscale. the rate of nucleation process is extremely temperature sensitive. and the morphology of a critical nucleus can be highly nonspherical and complex. In this article. we briefly review the recent advances in modeling and predicting nucleation during solid-phase transformations based on the diffuse-interface or nonclassical description of critical nucleus profiles. The focus is on predicting the critical nucleus morphology and nucleation free energy barrier under the influence of anisotropic interfacial energy and elastic interactions.

These cells typically employ polymer membranes as electrolytes for protonic conduction that are operable only under humid conditions. This requirement limits their operating temperature range to 373 K. Solid acids are a relatively new class of electrolytes that allow protonic conduction at temperatures above 373 K and are thereby free from water management issues.

1136241,Improving thermodynamic property estimation through volume translation,2009,Kurt Frey and Jefferson W Tester and Michael Modell,,,,,,Steady state process simulation is used throughout the chemical industry to guide development and help reduce uncertainty and risk. Volumetric equations of state (EOS)s are the most robust of the numerous methods available for estimating various thermodynamic properties of interest because they are valid for the entire fluid phase. In some operating regimes. such as those near or above a component's critical point. EOS methods are the only option available. Improving the property estimation accuracy of EOSs through volume translation is an attractive approach because mathematical translations can be layered onto currently implemented models without altering the underlying (untranslated) equation. However. unconstrained volume translation functions can lead to nonphysical results. such as negative heat capacities. in the translated model. This project has created a framework for modifying EOSs through volume translation so that the translated model still retains the global validity characteristic of EOS models. A novel volume translation method dependent on both temperature and density was then developed and applied to the Soave-Redlich-Kwong EOS. This modified translation provides good molar volume accuracy (within five percent of accepted values) for a wide variety of pure compounds. The improvement in accuracy in the region around the critical point is particularly noteworthy. as the modified translation is more accurate than other. extended virial-type EOSs that require more than twice as many adjustable parameters.,True,FZBemEUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,8,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/58065,12755660897063559937,/scholar?cites=12755660897063559937,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/58065/615702694-MIT.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

However. the impact of this technology has so far fallen short of its potential due to several daunting challenges.

We use molecular dynamics simulations to model the solid amorphous polymer electrolyte system comprising poly(ethylene) oxide (PEO). lithium. and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion (TFSI). exploring effects of high salt concentrations relevant for battery applications. Using statistical analysis of ion distribution and transport. we investigate the significant effect that salt concentration has on ion mobility.

This deviation from Paschen's curve is attributed to ion-enhanced field emission and notably breaks pressure times distance ( pd ) scaling. Here. 1-D particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations at moderately high pressures are used to predict breakdown and reproduce the modified Paschen's curve. which is in good agreement with existing theory. These simulations reveal that the net positive space charge that accumulates in the electrode gap enhances the electric field. subsequently enhancing field emission from the cathode.

We then use liquid ion chromatography to show that the CO 2−(aq) intermediate ultimately reacts to produce oxalate and formate. The overall faradaic efficiency of the reaction is close to 10% for a CO 2 (aq) concentration of 34 mM.

In this paper. resonant tunneling behavior is investigated by solving the one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in the presence of an ion. and the enhancement due to resonant processes is evaluated. Results shows that as the applied electric field increases. the resonant states move from higher to lower energies as the ion energy levels are shifted down. Conversely. as the ion position moves closer to the cathode. the resonant states shift up in energy. Further. through a simplified perturbation analysis. the general scaling of these trends can be predicted.

Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents. and it has been postulated that they play an important role in the interfacial chemistry between a gaseous plasma or discharge and a conductive liquid. However. due to the high local concentrations of reactive species at the interface. they have a short average lifetime (~1 µs). which makes them extremely difficult to detect. The TIRAS technique uses a unique total internal reflection geometry combined with amplitude-modulated lock-in amplification to distinguish solvated electrons' absorbance signal from other spurious noise sources. This enables the in situ detection of short-lived intermediates in the interfacial region. as opposed to the bulk measurement of stable products in the solution. This approach is especially attractive for the field of plasma electrochemistry. where much of the important chemistry is driven by short-lived free radicals. This experimental method has been used to analyze the reduction of nitrite (NO2-(aq)). nitrate (NO3-(aq)). hydrogen peroxide (H2O2(aq)). and dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) by plasma-solvated electrons and deduce effective rate constants. Limitations of the method may arise in the presence of unintended parallel reactions. such as air contamination in the plasma. and absorbance measurements may also be hindered by the precipitation of reduced electrochemical products.

The ionization of Cu and He. the inverse bremsstrahlung absorption processes and photoionization process. and the back flux onto the target are considered simultaneously. The binary diffusion. the viscosity. and the thermal conduction including the electron thermal conduction are considered as well. Numerical results show that the consideration of ionization and laser absorption in the plume greatly influences the gas dynamics. The ionization of Cu enables the recondensation at the target surface to happen even during the laser pulse. The ionization degree of Cu and He may change greatly with the location in the plume.

Decreasing the pH from 8 to 1 increases the rate of hydrogenation of phenol on Pt at 20 bar H2 and 80 °C by 15-fold.

A promising area of research concerns the role that near-surface alloys (NSAs) can play in endowing surfaces with novel catalytic properties. NSAs are defined as alloys wherein a solute metal is present near the surface of a host metal in concentrations different from the bulk; here we use density functional theory calculations to introduce a new class of these alloys that can yield superior catalytic behaviour for hydrogen-related reactions. Some of these NSAs bind atomic hydrogen (H) as weakly as the noble metals (Cu. Au) while. at the same time. dissociating H 2 much more easily. This unique set of properties may permit these alloys to serve as low-temperature. highly selective catalysts for pharmaceuticals production and as robust fuel-cell anodes.,True,9T-76VMiZrwC:OU6Ihb5iCvQC,1053,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat1223,10292724170307242590,/scholar?cites=10292724170307242590,,,0,0,0

Catalysts based on bulk silver surfaces with direct propylene epoxidation by molecular oxygen have not resolved these problems because of substantial formation of carbon dioxide. We found that unpromoted. size-selected Ag3 clusters and ~3.5-nanometer Ag nanoparticles on alumina supports can catalyze this reaction with only a negligible amount of carbon dioxide formation and with high activity at low temperatures.

The reaction of lithium with crystalline silicon is known to present a rich range of phenomena. including electrochemical solid state amorphization. crystallization at full lithiation of a Li15Si4 phase. hysteresis in the first lithiation–delithiation cycle. and highly anisotropic lithiation in crystalline samples. Very little is known about these processes at an atomistic level. however. To provide fundamental insights into these issues. we develop and apply a first principles. history-dependent. lithium insertion and removal algorithm to model the process of lithiation and subsequent delithiation of crystalline Si.

In each case investigated. the Pt surface d-band was broadened and lowered in energy by interactions with the subsurface 3d metals. resulting in weaker dissociative adsorption energies of hydrogen and oxygen on these surfaces. The magnitude of the decrease in adsorption energy was largest for the early 3d transition metals and smallest for the late 3d transition metals. In some cases. dissociative adsorption was calculated to be endothermic.

We show how increasing coverages of oxygen atoms lead to a broadening of the surface atom d-bands and a consequent reduction in the average energy of the d-band center due to conservation of the d-band filling. The reduction in the energy of the d-band center leads to a correlated increase (weakening) in the adsorption energy.

Lanxess) was evaluated for use in CO2 capture applications. The polymeric resin was characterized by SEM. DRIFTS-IR. N2 adsorption isotherms. and packed bed sorption measurements to determine some of the characteristic properties of the resin. Capture capacities ranging from 1.85 to 1.15 mol CO2/kg sorbent were obtained in a packed bed reactor exposed to 10 vol % CO2 in N2 at adsorption temperatures ranging from 30 to 70 °C. The capture capacity of the resin was stable over 18 adsorption/regeneration cycles.

1136429,Correlations in coverage-dependent atomic adsorption energies on Pd (111),2009,John R Kitchin,79,Physical Review B,20,205412,American Physical Society,The adsorption energy of an adsorbate can depend strongly on its coverage. We present density-functional calculations of the adsorption energy of C. N. and O on the fcc sites of Pd (111) at coverages from 0.2 to 1 ML. The adsorption energy generally increases (gets weaker) with coverage in a near linear fashion for the most stable configurations. We observed a practically constant d-band filling at all coverages and interpret the coverage dependence in terms of a simple d-band model where the d band is broadened and lowered in energy by the interaction with the adsorbates. We find the Pd (111) d-band center is approximately linearly correlated with the coverage of each adsorbate. A consequence of this electronic structure-coverage correlation for each adsorbate is that the adsorption energies of each adsorbate configuration are strongly correlated with each other.

The Hubbard U is the computationally cheapest addition one can use to capture correct reaction energies. but the specific Hubbard U oftentimes must be empirically determined only when suitable experimental data exist. We evaluated the effect of adding a calculated. linear response U on the predicted adsorption energies. scaling relationships. and activity trends with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction for a set of transition metal dioxides.

It is concluded that the ferroelectric polarization decreases electron drift to the surface in domains with a negative polarization. causing spatially selective photochemical behavior. and that the direction of the polarization is more important than the amplitude.,True,vO15bQkAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,60,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am200127c,4342095989200067815,/scholar?cites=4342095989200067815,,http://mimp.materials.cmu.edu/rohrer/papers/2011_04.pdf,0,0,0

Using a narrowly focused beam from the Advanced Photon Source. such chromium oxide deposits were unequivocally identified in the active region of the cathode by X-ray diffraction. suggesting that the triple phase boundaries were partially blocked. Under fuel cell operating conditions. the reaction has an equilibrium potential of about and the rate of chromium oxide deposition is therefore dependent on the operating potential of the cell. It becomes diffusion limited after several hours of steady operation. At low operating potentials. lanthanum manganite cathodes begin to be reduced to MnO. which reacts with the chromium oxide to form the spinel.,True,vO15bQkAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,59,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1.3266930/meta,5929383663678574576,/scholar?cites=5929383663678574576,,,0,0,0

Thin film deposition has been shown previously to be well suited to stabilizing both highly metastable phases and superlattices having unique atomic order which are not attainable via classical preparatory routes. That this approach is only in the early stages of realizing its full potential as a synthetic method is demonstrated using classical pulsed laser deposition to grow new. artificially layered materials. Superlattices of metastable copper and manganese oxides having perovskite-like sub-cells were grown; they have the nominal formulae (La   0.8 Ba   0.2 CuO   2.6±x )        m    (SrCuO   2+δ )        n     and (LaMnO   3 )        m    (A′MnO   3 )        n     (A′=Sr and Y).

Photochemical reaction products were formed on the TiO2 surface in patterns that correspond to the underlying domain structure of BaTiO3. As the film thickness increases from 10 to 100 nm. the titania more effectively screens the ferroelectric field. and the pattern of reaction products is obscured.

The catalysts with the titanate cores had enhanced photocatalytic activities for methylene blue degradation compared to their components alone. whereas the catalysts with ferrite cores did not.

Our simulations predict that the lipid order in a phospholipid bilayer. as a model system for the cell membrane. decreases upon addition of lipid peroxidation products. Eventually. when all phospholipids are oxidized. pore formation can occur. This will allow reactive species. such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). to enter the cell and cause oxidative damage to intracellular macromolecules. such as DNA or proteins. On the other hand. upon increasing the cholesterol fraction of lipid bilayers. the cell membrane order increases. eventually reaching a certain threshold. from which cholesterol is able to protect the membrane against pore formation.

Small energy barriers were identified for the conversion of a physisorbed to a chemisorbed configuration. CO2 dissociation is found to be unfeasible on the stoichiometric surface. The introduction of oxygen vacancy defects gives rise to new highly stable adsorption configurations with a stronger activation of the C–O bonds.

To assess this empirically. this paper analyzes the five-year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for conventional. hybrid. and electric vehicles in 14 U.S. cities from 2011 to 2015. Results show spatial variation due to differences in state and local policies. fuel prices. insurance and maintenance costs. depreciation rates. and vehicle miles traveled.

This paper assesses the relationships between measures of the sustainability of transportation systems in US metropolitan areas and subjective well-being. Associations between self-reported happiness levels from the Gallup Healthways Well-being Index and commute data were examined for 187 core-based statistical areas (CBSA). We also supplement this quantitative analysis through brief case studies of high-and low-performing happiness cities. Our quantitative results indicate that regions with higher commute mode shares by non-automobile modes generally had higher well-being scores. even when controlling for important economic predictors of happiness. We also find that pro-sustainable transportation policies can have implications for population-wide happiness and well-being. Our case studies indicate that both high and low scoring happiness cities demonstrate a dedicated commitment to improving sustainable transportation infrastructure. Our study suggests that cities that provide incentives for residents to use more sustainable commute modes may offer greater opportunity for happiness than those that do not.

1136521,Fueled by crisis: US alternative fuel policy. 1975-2007,2013,Hanna L Breetz,,,,,,"This dissertation investigates the policy-making process that led to three ""crash programs"" for alternative fuels after energy shocks in the 1970s and early 2000s: (1) the proposed Energy Independence Authority in 1975-1976. (2) the Synthetic Fuels Corporation in 1979-1980. and (3) the revised Renewable Fuel Standard in 2007. These were massively ambitious programs. with enormous budgets and unachievable technological goals. What makes them truly puzzling. though. is that they were major policies that emerged without major advocates. Although various interest groups and constituencies supported the development of alternative fuels. neither the powerful industry lobbies (oil. coal. corn. ethanol) nor the public interest groups (environment) had previously advocated for interventions of this scope and scale. This presents a fundamental empirical puzzle for public policy scholars. as it contradicts our understanding of the drivers of policy change. Typically. the policy process literature portrays radical policy change as resulting from the strategic efforts of interest or advocacy groups during a window of opportunity. Here. however. radical policy change occurred in the absence of lobbying or advocacy efforts. What explains this phenomenon? How do we account for the creation of these programs?

1136522,Small nuclear reactors for military installations: capabilities. costs. and technological implications,2011,Richard B Andres and Hanna L Breetz,,,,,NATIONAL DEFENSE UNIV WASHINGTON DC INST FOR NATIONAL STRATEGIC STUDIES,In recent years. the US Department of Defense DOD has become increasingly interested in the potential of small less than 300 megawatts electric MWe nuclear reactors for military use. DODs attention to small reactors stems mainly from two critical vulnerabilities it has identified in its infrastructure and operations the dependence of US military bases on the fragile civilian electrical grid. and the challenge of safely and reliably supplying energy to troops in forward operating locations. DOD has responded to these challenges with an array of initiatives on energy efficiency and renewable and alternative fuels. Unfortunately. even with massive investment and ingenuity. these initiatives will be insufficient to solve DODs reliance on the civilian grid or its need for convoys in forward areas. The purpose of this paper is to explore the prospects for addressing these critical vulnerabilities through small-scale nuclear plants. Several Congressional and DOD actors have already indicated an interest in military applications of small reactors. In early 2008. the Air Force. at the behest of former Senators Pete Domenici and Larry Craig. considered a pilot program to deploy small reactors on at least one of its bases. In late 2009. the National Defense Authorization Act authorized a study on the feasibility of developing nuclear power plants on military installations. Additionally. a handful of defense analysts have publicly advocated using nuclear power plants for military electricity and mobility. and a joint DOD-Department of Energy DOE working group. in cooperation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC. is now studying options for small nuclear reactors on …,True,J5nXU0wAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,11,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA545712,16646850620860172167,/scholar?cites=16646850620860172167,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA545712.pdf,0,0,0

It is a controversial spillover effect of biofuels that is estimated by “shocking” agricultural market models with high biofuel scenarios.

As a case study of ILUC discourse. this chapter analyzes how ILUC science was interpreted and strategically framed during rulemaking for the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) in 2007–2009. The analysis covers three stages of the initial rulemaking process: academic advisory reports. agency rulemaking documents. and public comments.

1136535,Attitudes of first‐year engineering students to mathematics—A case study,1997,CT Shaw and VF Shaw,28,International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology,2,289-301,Taylor & Francis Group,As the spectrum of entry qualifications in mathematics offered by engineering students has changed. so disquiet has been expressed about the ability of students to cope with traditional programmes in mathematics. This paper reviews the performance of engineering students in first‐year mathematics at the University of Warwick and compares students who have different mathematics qualifications on entry. While there is some correlation between performance at university and mathematics grade at A level and marks in Foundation or Access courses. there is no correlation for BTEC students. The spread of results for students with similar entry qualifications is large. and so the variability of performance is likely to be the result of other factors.

A pressure correction equation is derived from the momentum and continuity equations. and equal‐order interpolation is used for both the velocity components and pressure. Algorithms such as this have been known to lead to checkerboard pressure oscillations; however. the pressure correction equation of this scheme should not produce these oscillations.

Whilst laser Doppler anemometry and particle image velocimetry are becoming widespread in their application. they are not necessarily suitable for this application due to their low rate of data capture when air is the working fluid. In this paper. a methodology that has already been applied successfully to low Reynolds number flows is applied to a turbulent wake. This involves the use of hot-wire anemometry to capture a large number of time series of velocity throughout the wake of a model road passenger vehicle. These time series are then analysed by a mathematical analysis tool known as singular systems analysis. which enables the low-frequency components of a noisy signal to be determined.

Household occupants often deviate from thermostat programs. perhaps due to differing thermal comfort preferences. which are strong drivers of residential energy use and vary across genders. This study aims to develop an initial typology of interpersonal interactions around thermal comfort. explore the role of gender in such interactions. and examine the impacts of interactions on thermostat adjustments. Using n = 1568 diary observations collected from 112 participants. we identify three interaction types: conflicts. compromises. and agreements.

It is intended to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in evaluating the validity of renewable resource development in general. The 1978 examination based its estimates on a projection of 4500 MW of electricity generation capacity developing in the Region by 2020. and identified other applications for the geothermal resources as well (eg. direct use as a heat source). It also projected significant economic gains and a minimum of negative side-effects. Today. the geothermal electricity generating capacity is less than a quarter of what was projected. While projects currently in development could more than double this capacity by 2020. installed geothermal capacity in Imperial Valley would still fall far short of the 4500 MW originally predicted. We examine several possible reasons for the shortfall. These include economic viability issues of geothermal resources. technical problems with geothermal resources. cost to generate electricity from geothermal sources compared to price received for it. lack of adequate long-distance electricity transmission line capacity. and concern over negative side-effects. We find that estimates of the amount of electricity generation capacity that can be supported by geothermal fields in Imperial Valley have been significantly revised downwards. Further. recent electricity wholesale data suggest prices are often lower than the levelized cost of generation from geothermal. Constraints on the ability to export electricity out of Imperial Valley also appear to have been …,True,M9G6_j8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://cgs.usc.edu/files/2018/03/94798-sdi2g9.pdf,,,,https://cgs.usc.edu/files/2018/03/94798-sdi2g9.pdf,0,0,0

In recent years it has been taken on board by the British government in as much as they have committed to eradicate it by the middle of this decade. A household is in fuel poverty if it would need to spend more than 10% of the total household income on all household fuels to achieve a satisfactory indoor environment. A satisfactory indoor environment is defined as being at temperatures of at least 21 C in the living areas and 18 C in other parts of the house. The number of households in fuel poverty in the United Kingdom has been variously estimated at somewhere between one million and seven million. with a median acknowledged by the government of around three million in 2001. This number would mean some 14% of the population in the United Kingdom were in fuel …,True,3xQWpWkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,76,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3985270667334120163&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3985270667334120163,/scholar?cites=3985270667334120163,,http://sustainablecities.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/Fuel-Poverty-paper.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore finding a general relationship between the embodied energy and the cost of buildings can give a shortcut to such embodied energy estimates. which may also be of assistance to help reduce energy consumption. In this study detailed embodied energy and cost data for three commercial buildings were obtained for two countries. China and New Zealand. The results suggested some correlation between embodied energy and the cost of individual building components for each building. as well as a correlation between the total embodied energy and the cost of the buildings.

The model finds that business as usual models. which involve growth rates in world electricity demand of between 2% and 3.2% p.a.. exhibit severe material difficulties before the end of this century. If the growth rate is lowered to 1% p.a.. then it may be possible to reach the year 2100 before such difficulties. but it is likely that material constraints will occur early the next century. Steady state scenarios show that silicon based photovoltaic panels could. however. displace fossil fuels before the middle of the century. providing around the same order of magnitude as present (2010) world electricity demand.

The science suggests that a transition from fossil fuels to sustainable sources of energy in a time frame commensurate with the demise of the fossil fuels and prevention of runaway climate change is needed. However. while the movement towards sustainable energy technologies is underway. the World does not want to give up the idea of continuing economic growth. In recent times the financial collapse of October 2008 has given rise to yet another set of pleas from corporations and politicians alike to restart the growth machine. The transition to renewable energy technologies will be difficult to achieve as nowhere within existing economic and political frameworks are the limits to when growth will be curtailed being set. It is possible that the irrational insistence on endless growth as a non negotiable axiom. by a large proportion of the world’s population. may in fact be akin to the similarly irrational belief. by a similarly large proportion of the world’s population. that a supernatural being controls our existence and destiny.

Depth of activity rods have been used to identify those hummocks that formed during sediment transport events when the near‐bed currents were recorded directly using electromagnetic flowmeters.

1136605,Formation and behavior of aeolian streamers,2005,Andreas Cornelis Wilhelmus Baas and DJ Sherman,110,Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface,F3,,,Field experiments were conducted to determine the characteristic spatial and temporal dimensions and behavior of aeolian streamers and to identify the processes responsible for their formation. An instrument array that included anemometer towers. piëzo‐electric transport sensors (Safires). and hot‐film probes was deployed to measure streamers and airflow dynamics on both a coastal dune and a desert sand mound in California. Aeolian transport occurs predominantly in the form of families of intertwining and bifurcating streamers. while under intense wind forcing. more complex patterns of nested streamers and clouds with embedded streamers develop. The streamers display a characteristic width of approximately 0.2 m and an average lateral spacing of about 1 m. These dimensions appear to be independent of mean airflow characteristics.

Dordrecht,Over the past several decades. a number of studies have shown that intergranular cohesion associated with the presence of moisture significantly increases the critical shear velocity required to initiate motion in sand grains. and decreases transport rates. This paper examines currently available models of moisture effects and compares model predictions for several hypothetical situations. Model predictions exhibit considerable disagreement regarding the magnitude of moisture effects. For 0.27-mm sands. predicted increases in threshold shear velocity associated with a 1% moisture content ranged from about 8% to 148% of the expected dry threshold velocity. and with 4% moisture increased to 47%–206% of the dry value.

1136617,Coastal dune dynamics: problems and prospects,1999,BERNARD O Bauer and DOUGLAS J Sherman,,"Aeolian environments, sediments and landforms",,71-104,Wiley Chichester,Efforts toward prediction of coastal dune dynamics are hampered by several non-trivial linkages between dunes and their surrounding environments. The most significant among these is the intimate inter-relationship between coastal dunes and the suite of nearshore processes fronting them (eg wave-related dune scarping. overwash of blowout throats. and swash-related sediment deposition on the foreshore and back beach). In this regard. the only distinctive coastal dune–the foredune–is very unlike other dunes commonly found in secondary dune fields or in dry-land environments that are dominantly wind sculpted. The effects of vegetation. moisture and topographic slope are additional factors that have a pronounced influence on the diverse geometry and dynamics of coastal dunes. Empirical studies of coastal dune dynamics have generally followed one of two divergent strategies: the mechanistic-reductionist approach. which focuses on progressively smaller and smaller constituent parts of a complex system. versus the holisticconstructivist approach. which strives to understand fundamental essences and behaviours of complete systems. Examples of the mechanistic-reductionist approach include studies into the hydrodynamic processes by which sediments are exchanged between the foreshore and foredune. the trapping of sediments by vegetation covers. or the mechanics of aeolian saltation. At the smallest end of the reductionist spectrum. the results of such studies can be generalised to any aeolian system. coastal or otherwise.

Two field projects were conducted to evaluate meter-scale spatial and temporal in the saltation field. In Shoalhaven Heads. NSW.

Previous work by other authors has established relationships. under ideal conditions. between the size of the stain. the number of spines and satellite stains. the roughness of the surface. the size of the blood droplet and the height from which it falls. To apply these relationships to infer the height of fall requires independent knowledge of the size of the droplet. This work aims to measure the size of droplets falling from objects representative of hand-held weapons.

Numerical results were validated against experimental data from the International Flame Research Foundation’s (IFRF) Furnace No. 1. The validation study focussed on comparisons between the finite rate and mixture fraction/PDF approaches to combustion chemistry. and different methods for defining coal particle size distributions. The aerodynamics and effects of varying the coal flow rate have been investigated for the rotary lime kiln. In this preliminary study and because the main interest is the flame characteristics. the effects of the reacting limestone bed have been ignored.

A post-processing procedure called DSMC rapid ensemble averaging method (DREAM) is developed to improve the statistical scatter in the results while minimising both memory and simulation time. This method builds an ensemble average of repeated runs over small number of sampling intervals prior to the sampling point of interest by restarting the flow using either a Maxwellian distribution based on macroscopic properties for near equilibrium flows (DREAM-I) or output instantaneous particle data obtained by the original unsteady sampling of PDSC for strongly non-equilibrium flows (DREAM-II).

The University of Queensland,Cardiovascular diseases are on of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in the western world. Amongst these diseases. atherosclerosis. a progressive narrowing of the arterial wall is one of the most severe and if untreated may lead to stroke or ischemic infarction. Fluid mechanic forces are a key player in the early development and progression of atherosclerosis and a better understanding of the interplay between haemodynamic and vascular diseases is needed. The carotid artery (CA) in one of the predominant sites of atherosclerotic plaque formation. In this work a transparent. scaled model of an average human carotid artery (AHCA) bifurcation was constructed and steady blood flow at Re= 290 and Re= 700 was simulated using an aqueous glycerin solution. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were performed in the plane of bifurcation and three axial planes in the carotid sinus. Flow inside the CA bifurcation was found to be three-dimensional with strong secondary currents due to the curvature of the vessel. An accurate method for wall shear stress (WSS) calculation along the outer internal carotid artery (ICA) wall is introduced. The method was tested against synthetically generated particle images and was found to perform best for an 8x8 pix2 interrogation windows. A large low momentum flow region with low WSS along the outer ICA wall exists. posing the potential for atherosclerotic plaque formation. Calculated WSS ranged between 0 and 21.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death in the USA with approximately 650.000 fatalities a year and involves a progressive constriction of the coronary artery by atherosclerosis. Blood flow is reduced and when under stress the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen and nutrients. The blood flow in the coronary artery is strongly influenced by the flexing of the artery wall. In this work a method for manufacturing silicone models with compliance controlled by the wall thickness and the cross-wall (transmural) pressure difference. of arteries with varying stenosis (narrowing related to atherosclerosis and other circulatory diseases). is demonstrated. PIV analysis is used to compare results between a rigid and compliant straight tube model experiencing a physiological realistic flow wave with in vivo parameters of time period 1s. mean and peak Reynolds numbers 540 and 920 respectively and a Womersley number of 4.54. In vitro results are obtained in models scaled to 2.8 times in vivo dimensions. A method for analysing 3 dimensional surface displacement is used to study the effects of static loading on compliant models with 30% symmetric and asymmetric stenosis. The results show that at physiologically relevant levels of compliance there is a variation in the flow field when compared to rigid pipes and that the surface displacement is dominated by radial motion with a smaller axial motion being present.,True,pBTS46AAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,12,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Buchmann/publication/258918205_SPIV_and_image_correlation_measurements_of_surface_displacement_during_pulsatile_flow_in_models_of_compliant_healthy_and_stenosed_arteries/links/55c3320908aeb975673e5adf/SPIV-and-image-correlation-measurements-of-surface-displacement-during-pulsatile-flow-in-models-of-compliant-healthy-and-stenosed-arteries.pdf,8466228038601566516,/scholar?cites=8466228038601566516,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicolas_Buchmann/publication/258918205_SPIV_and_image_correlation_measurements_of_surface_displacement_during_pulsatile_flow_in_models_of_compliant_healthy_and_stenosed_arteries/links/55c3320908aeb975673e5adf/SPIV-and-image-correlation-measurements-of-surface-displacement-during-pulsatile-flow-in-models-of-compliant-healthy-and-stenosed-arteries.pdf,0,0,0

For adults. NHF therapy feeds 30–60 L/min of warm humidified air into the nose through short cannulas which do not seal the nostril. NHF therapy has been reported to increase airway pressure. increase tidal volume (Vt) and decrease respiratory rate (RR). but it is unclear how these findings affect the work done to overcome airway resistance to air flow during expiration. Also. there is little information on how the choice of nasal cannula size may affect work of breathing.

Using bovine and ovine heads and simulant materials. evidence of this ejection was sought by measuring the velocity of the air that was drawn in and ejected from the cavity in front of the wound channel after bullet impact. A laminar flow of fog-laden air was arranged in front of the wound channel and two high speed cameras recording at 30.000 frames/second captured the air motion. All samples were shot with standard 9 mm × 19 mm FMJ ammunition. Different concentrations of ballistic gelatine were used to characterize the effect of elasticity of the material on the velocity of the air. Fresh bovine and ovine heads were shot with the same experimental set up to investigate if there was induction of air into. and ejection of air …,True,pBTS46AAAAAJ:vRqMK49ujn8C,8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073814004708,14698944034989588325,/scholar?cites=14698944034989588325,,,0,0,0

In-vitro measurement of blood flow in compliant arterial phantoms can provide better insight into haemodynamic states and therapeutic procedures. However. current fabrication techniques are not capable of producing thin-walled compliant phantoms of complex shapes. This study presents a new approach for the fabrication of compliant phantoms suitable for optical measurement. Two 1.5× scaled models of the ascending aorta. including the brachiocephalic artery (BCA). were fabricated from silicone elastomer Sylgard-184. The initial phantom used the existing state of the art lost core manufacturing technique with simple end supports. an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) additive manufactured male mould and Ebalta-milled female mould. The second phantom was produced with the same method but used more rigid end supports and ABS male and female moulds. The wall thickness consistency and quality of resulting stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) were used to verify the fidelity of the phantom for optical measurement and investigation of physiological flow fields. However. the initial phantom had a rough surface that obscured SPIV analysis and had a variable wall thickness (range= 0.815 mm). The second phantom provided clear particle images and had a less variable wall thickness (range= 0.317 mm). The manufacturing method developed is suitable for fast and cost-effective fabrication of different compliant arterial phantom geometries.

1136668,Stereoscopic PIV measurement of airflow in human speech during pronunciation of fricatives,2012,Patrick H Geoghegan and Callum JT Spence and Wei H Ho and Xiao B Lu and M Jermy and PJ Hunter and JE Cater,1,,,,,The interaction of the airflow and the vocal articulators while speaking is not completely understood. The regions of articulation in the airway are flow obstructions that convert aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy and can be passive (stationary) such as the teeth and hard palate. or active (moving) in the case of the lower lip and tongue. By modifying the positions of the vocal articulators the various sounds that make up speech can be generated. A fricative is a hissing or buzzing consonant that is produced when a steady air stream is forced through a constriction in the oral cavity and the flow state becomes transitional or even turbulent. Two simplified 3D models of the articulators (lips. teeth. tongue. hard palate. and larynx) were constructed from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) producing a fricative‘s’ and ‘sh’sound. An investment casting technique was used to produce 1.55 times scaled rigid transparent silicone flow phantoms of these models with a RMS discrepancy between the 3D model and phantom of 0.5 and 0.57 mm for the‘s’ and ‘sh’models respectively. Time averaged stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) measurements of the airflow through the modelled vocal tract geometries experiencing an in vivo steady expiration flow rate of 12 l/min applied in vitro using Reynolds number matching were obtained. SPIV results in a series of traversed planes were reconstructed into a 3D 3C volume.The location of the tongue. and lip configuration were major contributors to the differing flow regimes obtained.

The walls move under the influence of the fluid pressure and muscle action. Examples include the heart. lungs and abdominal aortic aneurysms. Currently. coupled CFDFEA models of the fluid dynamics and wall behaviour are being used to analyse the interaction between blood pressure and wall shear stress. Techniques for modelling wall compliance and the use of fluid structure interaction (FSI) codes for analysis of hemodynamic arterial wall interaction are not yet mature. There is a need for experimental data taken under well controlled conditions to validate numerical predictions. This paper provides a method for the construction of thin walled compliant models which can be analysed using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A transparent compliant tube is constructed.

The dam-break problem is considered which results from the release of a gate initially separating two fluid pools of different depth. The flow velocity is measured by seeding the free surface with buoyant particles and using Particle Tracking Velocimetry. In parallel. a mathematical model based on the lubrication approximation for fluids with a power-law rheology is developed. The model is validated against a similarity solution which is obtained for the spreading of a gravity current under its own weight and neglecting surface tension. Minimizing the difference between the free surface velocity fields obtained numerically and measured experimentally enables the identification of rheological parameters.

Mechanical Engineering,Compliant (flexible) structures play an important role in several biofluid problems including flow in the lungs. heart and arteries.  Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease which causes a remodelling of the arterial wall causing a restriction (stenosis) by thickening the intima and the formation of vascular plaque by the deposit of fatty materials.  This remodelling alters the compliance of the artery stiffening the arterial wall locally.  A common location for this to occur is in the carotid artery which supplies blood to both the brain and the face.  It can lead to complete occlusion of the artery in the extreme case and is a major cause of stroke and ischemic infarction.  Stroke is the third largest cause of death in the U.S.A.. but even if not fatal it can cause coma. paralysis. speech problems and dementia.  Atherosclerosis causes a change in the local hemodynamics.  It can produce areas of flow separation and low wall shear stress. which can lead to endothelial dysfunction and to promotion of plaque growth.

An important class of bloodstains. sometimes found at crime scenes. arises from expirated blood. ie blood expelled from the nose and/or mouth as the victim breathes out. Currently. the range of initial velocities of these droplets is poorly known. The droplet size. velocity and impact angle determine the characteristics of the stain resulting from impact on a nearby surface. In this work. stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV) is used to investigate the velocity field exiting a scale of 1.55 times life size physiologically realistic silicone model of the nasal cavity. An in-house developed computer model is used to predict the trajectory of blood drops (representative diameters of 0.5 mm and 2 mm) exiting the nasal cavity and ascertain their impact velocity and location on a ground plane 1.7 m (the average height of an adult male nose) below the nostril exit. The nostril geometry is shown to have an effect on the exit velocity with a difference of 0.49 m/s difference experienced between the maximum exit velocity of the left and right nostril. This variation in exit velocity was shown to have minimal effect on the impact velocity as the gravitational forces experienced after leaving the nasal jet dominated the droplet acceleration. The variation in velocity did however affect the resulting impact location of the drop (a difference of 46.7 mm for the 0.5 mm drop). Increase in drop size was shown increase the impact velocity. but reduce the distance between the impact location and the nostril exit.,True,pBTS46AAAAAJ:q3oQSFYPqjQC,2,http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/lxlaser/lxlaser2014/finalworks2014/papers/03.15_1_108paper.pdf,1269482311471030341,/scholar?cites=1269482311471030341,,http://ltces.dem.ist.utl.pt/lxlaser/lxlaser2014/finalworks2014/papers/03.15_1_108paper.pdf,0,0,0

A detailed understanding of CO 2 ice spectroscopy is a prerequisite to characterize CO 2 interactions with other volatiles both in interstellar ices and in laboratory experiments of interstellar ice analogs. We report laboratory spectra of the CO 2 longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode in pure CO 2 ice and in CO 2 ice mixtures with H 2 O. CO. and O 2 components. We show that the LO phonon mode position is sensitive to the mixing ratio of various ice components of astronomical interest. In the era of the James Webb Space Telescope. this characteristic could be used to constrain interstellar ice compositions and morphologies.

1136682,Experimental studies of gas-phase reactivity in relation to complex organic molecules in star-forming regions,2019,Ilsa R Cooke and Ian R Sims,3,,7,1109-1134,American Chemical Society,The field of astrochemistry concerns the formation and abundance of molecules in the interstellar medium. star-forming regions. exoplanets. and solar system bodies. These astrophysical objects contain the chemical material from which new planets and solar systems are formed. Around 200 molecules have thus far been observed in the interstellar medium; almost half containing six or more atoms and considered “complex” by astronomical standards. All of these complex molecules consist of at least one carbon atom and thus the term complex organic molecules (COMs) has been coined by the astrochemical community. In order to understand the formation and destruction of these COMs under the extreme conditions of star-forming regions. three kinds of activity are involved: (1) the astronomical identification of complex molecules present in the interstellar medium; (2) the construction of astrochemical models that …,True,E9tkO9IAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,10,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.9b00064,11424540286263710188,/scholar?cites=11424540286263710188,,,0,0,0

These mantles. of thicknesses on the order of 100 monolayers. are primarily composed of H2O. CO. and CO2. Laboratory experiments using interstellar ice analogues have shown that porosity could be present and can facilitate diffusion of molecules along the inner pore surfaces. However. the movement of molecules within and upon the ice is poorly described by current chemical kinetics models. making it difficult either to reproduce the formation of experimental porous ice structures or to extrapolate generalized laboratory results to interstellar conditions. Here we use the off-lattice Monte Carlo kinetics model MIMICK to investigate the effects that various deposition parameters have on laboratory ice structures.

Benzonitrile is suggested to be a low-temperature proxy for benzene. one of the simplest aromatic molecules. which may be a precursor to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess the robustness of benzonitrile as a proxy for benzene. low-temperature kinetics measurements are required to confirm whether the reaction remains rapid at the low gas temperatures found in cold dense clouds.

A large number of COMs have been observed in astrophysical regions. even in very cold (<10 K) environments. challenging the widely accepted ""warm-up"" model in which COMs are formed on the surface of icy dust grains and delivered to the gas phase during star-formation. Methanol (CH3OH) is a COM of particular interest because it is an important parent species of larger and more complex molecules in the gas and ice phases. Neutral-radical reactions are an important destruction route for many species and. given the widespread abundance of the CN radical in space. the reaction between methanol and the CN radical is of significant interest. Here. we study the kinetics of the reaction between CH3OH and the CN radical using the well-established CRESU (Reaction Kinetics in Uniform Supersonic Flow) technique. combined with Pulsed Laser Photolysis-Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLP-LIF). Our results display a negative temperature dependence. typical of what has been seen previously for other radical-neutral reactions that do not possess potential barriers. The rate coefficient obtained at room temperature strongly disagrees with that measured by Sayah et. al. in a flow cell.

We have determined the equilibrium adsorption isotherms for the  nucleic acid purine and pyrimidine bases dissolved in water on the  surface of crystalline graphite. The markedly different adsorption  behavior of the bases describes an elutropic series: guanine >  adenine > hypoxanthine > thymine > cytosine >  uracil.

However. the current standard diagnostic techniques still show a number of limitations. Recently. the FECPAKG2 method was developed to detect helminth infections and asses drug efficacy in sheep or cattle. It includes a device that takes digital images of helminth eggs that have been concentrated into one microscopic field of view and stores these images online for future evaluation. The goal of this study was to introduce a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the detection and quantification of human STH eggs using the FECPAKG2 and to optimize 2 crucial steps of the protocol. namely the sedimentation step (aimed at separating sinking eggs from floating debris) and the accumulation step (aimed at concentrating the eggs by flotation).   Methodology/Principal findings A total of 55 stool samples from naturally infected children were used from 4 different geographical areas (Ethiopia. Laos. Tanzania and Brazil). The results showed that Trichuris eggs generally moved slower than eggs of the other two STH species during both sedimentation in water in the FECPAKG2 sedimenter as during accumulation in flotation solution in the FECPAKG2 cassettes. The highest number of eggs were present in the slurry of the sedimenter after overnight sedimentation (Ascaris: 95.7%. Trichuris: 89.8% and hookworm: 94.2% of the eggs).

This showed that the deepwater wave environment off the Kaikoura Peninsula is very energetic. but the amount of energy delivered to platforms is very low. In deep water. wave power ranged from 5900 to 106 700 N m s−1 per m of crest when calculated from mean significant wave height and when calculated from maximum wave height it ranged from 31 400 to 5 370 000 N m s−1 per m of crest. A comparison of deep water wave energy flux with wave energy flux at the high tide cliff of platforms showed that there was a reduction by as much as five orders of magnitude during storm conditions.

The view that shore platforms have a wave-cut origin has dominated the literature in the last 20 years. It is argued that this wave-cut origin remains to be convincingly demonstrated. Attempts to link platform morphology with the process environment have proven difficult but a recent demarcation between platform morphologies based on wave erosion and rock resistance offers an interesting and new way to consider platform morphology. Attempts to model platform development have been handicapped by a lack of data and a clear understanding of development processes.

Since 2004 and the Indian Ocean tsunami. most coastal boulder research has been focused on using boulders as sedimentary signatures of palaeo-tsunami events and the most commonly used transport equations typically suggest that large boulder deposits are products of tsunami rather than storms. There is growing empirical evidence demonstrating (on inter-annual to century timescales) that storm waves are capable of transporting and depositing boulders of significant size at elevations well above sea level. Current process studies of how boulders are eroded. transported and deposited have not received wide attention by rock coast geomorphologists or palaeoenvironmental reconstruction scientists.

New Zealand. caused by high lake levels and storm-wave runup,2002,RM Kirk and PD Komar and JC Allan and WJ Stephenson,16,Journal of Coastal Research,2,,,Lake Hawea lies within a glacial valley on the South Island of New Zealand. The southern shore of the lake consists of easily eroded glacial moraine that represents a problem area due to homes constructed there. In 1961 the lake was converted into a reservoir and its level was raised by 20 m with an operating range of about 8 m. The raised water levels produced erosion of the moraine to form a nearly vertical cliff. The released gravel forms a fronting beach that is now sufficiently wide to reduce further cliff erosion except during times when high lake levels coincide with the generation of waves by strong winds blowing along the length of the lake. Such an event occurred during December 1995 through January 1996. resulting in significant cliff erosion and the destruction of a revetment that had been built following a similar occurrence in 1984.

A chemical transport model and a RF model are used to evaluate the time period 2004–2030. when we expect increasing traffic in the Arctic region. Two datasets for ship emissions are used that characterize the potential impact from shipping and the degree to which shipping controls may mitigate impacts: a high (HIGH) scenario and a low scenario with Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR) of black carbon in the Arctic. In MFR. BC emissions in the Arctic are reduced with 70% representing a combination technology performance and/or reasonable advances in single-technology performance. Both scenarios result in moderate to substantial increases in concentrations of pollutants both globally and in the Arctic. Exceptions are black carbon in the MFR scenario. and sulfur species and organic carbon in both scenarios due to the future phase-in of current regulation that reduces fuel sulfur content.

Acute and chronic exposures to particulate matter are associated with a range of diseases. including chronic bronchitis and asthma. as well as premature deaths from cardiopulmonary disease. lung cancer. and acute lower respiratory infections. The transportation sector accounted for approximately 19 percent of global black carbon emissions in the year 2000. This report aims to inform efforts to control black carbon emissions from diesel-based transportation in developing countries. It presents a summary of emissions control approaches from developed countries. while recognizing that developing countries face a number of on-the-ground implementation challenges. This study applies a new cost-benefit analysis methodology to four simulated diesel black carbon emissions control projects-diesel retrofit in Istanbul. green freight (plus retrofit) in Sao Paulo. fuel and vehicle standards in Jakarta. and compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in Cebu taking into account the additional climate benefits of black carbon reductions. While this report focuses on quantifying just the health and climate benefits of transport interventions. it also serves to highlight the challenges that can be faced when undertaking more comprehensive evaluation of transport projects.

1136768,Refrigerants for light-duty passenger vehicle air conditioning systems,2011,Ray Minjares,3,The international council on clean transportation,,2011,,Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were widely adopted in the 1990s to replace chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerants that deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. but today they are among the most potent greenhouse gases. The European Union and the United States recently promulgated rules to control the climate impacts of HFCs used in motor vehicle air conditioning (MVAC) systems. In 2006. the European Commission adopted a rule that restricts the sale of 2011 new model vehicles containing refrigerants with a 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) greater than 150 (EU Parliament. 2006). In 2010 the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) adopted a greenhouse gas standard for model year 2012-2016 vehicles that provides credits to automakers who use refrigerants with a GWP100 lower than 1430 (US EPA. 2010). These performancebased regulations leave the choice of refrigerant to the automobile industry.The most widely used MVAC refrigerant today is 1. 1. 1. 2-tetrafluoroethane. also known as HFC-134a or R-134a. In 1990 no MVAC systems contained HFC-134a. but by 2003 it was being used in about seventy-four percent of vehicles (Clodic. 2005). By 2004 all vehicles produced or sold in North America. Japan. and Europe were using HFC-134a. This is the culmination of a 20-year shift away from dichlorodifluoromethane. also known as CFC-12 or R-12. which was used ubiquitously in 1990 but banned under the Montreal Protocol to limit depletion of stratospheric ozone.,True,_pmFJr8AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,14,https://www.academia.edu/download/33180987/2011_Minjares.pdf,17463225555998660416,/scholar?cites=17463225555998660416,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33180987/2011_Minjares.pdf,0,0,0
1136769,Estimated cost of gasoline particulate filters,2011,Ray J Minjares and Francisco Posada Sanchez,8,The International Council on Clean Transportation–Working Paper,,,,The gasoline particulate filter (GPF) is a device that can be installed on the tailpipe of a gasoline vehicle to capture and reduce emissions of particulate matter. a common pollutant. The European Commission is considering proposals for early adoption of gasoline particle number limit values by late 2011 or early 2012 (Steininger. 2011a). Likewise in California in tandem with the US EPA. regulators are considering actions to lower the particle mass limit based on the cost and availability of control strategies for particulate matter emissions from gasoline direct injection engines (GDI). The cost of a GPF may therefore affect the stringency of new tailpipe standards.Some GPF cost estimates have been given publicly. The European Commission’s Klaus Steininger has suggested a GPF cost between $57 and $184 (Steininger. 2011b). The Manufacturers of Emissions Controls Association (MECA) currently estimates a cost between $50 and $100 (Kubsh. 2011).

Black carbon is a potent short-lived climate pollutant with a warming impact 900 to 3200 times that of carbon dioxide. As a harmful ultrafine component of particulate matter. black carbon operates as a universal carrier of toxins into the lungs and bloodstream. thereby contributing to premature deaths from outdoor air pollution globally. These black carbon emissions come from older-generation diesel engine technology. found in more than 80% of new buses sold today. Investments in “soot-free” engine technology in urban bus fleets will accelerate progress toward addressing urban air pollution and near-term climate change.This report addresses the opportunities for facilitating. and the barriers to financing. the transition to soot-free urban bus fleets in 20 megacities. A soot-free engine is any diesel or alternative fuel engine that meets Euro VI or US 2010 emission standards. such as any diesel engine with a diesel particulate filter. gas engine. or dedicated electric drive engine. These engines. in combination with ultralow-sulfur diesel (10 ppm S or less) or alternative fuels. are capable of a 99% reduction in diesel black carbon emissions. The Climate & Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) launched the Soot-Free Urban Bus Fleets Project in 2015 to accelerate the deployment of soot-free engine technologies in 20 large cities around the world.

1136772,Global emissions of marine black carbon: critical review and revised assessment,2013,Haifeng Wang and Ray Minjares,,,13-1503,,,Black carbon (BC) emissions from international shipping are significant and contribute to global and regional climate change. particularly in the Arctic. This paper reviews global estimates of international marine BC emissions. identifies differences in inventory methods. and proposes an approach for improving upon existing estimates. A critical review of the literature reveals that more refined. specific marine vessel BC emission factors (EFBC) are not generally accounted for in most global inventories. We find that EFBC are the single most important source of differences in inventories due to poor sensitivity to ship engine type. fuel quality. and engine load. and we propose a weighting framework that better encapsulates such effects. Using fuel consumption estimates from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2009 greenhouse gas (GHG) report and updated EFBC. the authors estimate that shipping was responsible for about 184 thousand tonnes of BC in 2007. This estimate is 42% higher than the current IMO estimate. but comparable to recent studies informed by measured EFBC. The authors estimate that shipping contributed about 2.300 tonnes of BC in the Arctic in 2004. which is 90% higher than prevailing estimates. The findings suggest that the international marine BC contribution is widely underestimated. and that improvements to major BC inventories can be made to reflect state-of-the-art data on marine EFBC.,True,_pmFJr8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,8,https://trid.trb.org/view/1241027,615878492352185199,/scholar?cites=615878492352185199,,,0,0,0

Although cumulative carbon dioxide emissions since the preindustrial period are the most significant contributor to this warming. the short-lived climate pollutants emitted today—in particular. diesel black carbon—will also contribute to the warming we will experience in our own lifetimes. In fact. researchers estimate that up to 0.5 degrees of the warming that is expected over the next 25 years could be avoided by a 75% reduction in black carbon emissions alongside a 25% reduction in methane emissions and the elimination of hydrofluorocarbon emissions globally. 1 Achieving this will require investments in the transportation fleet to effectively eliminate diesel black carbon emissions.Between 60% and 80% of uncontrolled diesel exhaust is black carbon. a harmful ultrafine particle that can operate as a universal carrier of toxins to the lungs and the bloodstream.

China fully embraced HFC-134a in 2001 when it implemented its obligations under the 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-12). Today the HFC-134a system remains the dominant MAC system in China and around the world.While possessing zero ozone-depletion potential. HFC-134a can cause more than 1.500 times as much warming as an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide (CO2). With the rapid expansion of the Chinese automobile industry and the near-100% penetration of MAC systems in the light-duty passenger vehicle market. emissions of HFC-134a from the MAC sector are estimated to have tripled between 2005 and 2010 and are expected to continue increasing as the Chinese economy grows.

SOx. CO. NMVOCs. BC and OC. A set of models is used to evaluate the period 2004–2030. This time period reflects expected increasing traffic in the Arctic region. Two datasets for ship emissions 5 are used that may characterize the potential impact from shipping and the degree to which shipping controls may mitigate impacts: A high (HIGH) scenario and a low scenario with Maximum Feasible Reduction (MFR) of black carbon in the Arctic. In MFR. BC emissions in the Arctic are reduced with 70% representing a combination technology performance and/or reasonable advances in single-technology performance. Both 10 scenarios result in moderate to substantial increases in concentrations of pollutants both globally and in the Arctic. Exceptions are black carbon in the MFR scenario. and sulfur species and organic carbon in both scenarios due to the future phase-in of current regulation that reduces fuel sulfur content. In the season with potential transit traffic through the Arctic in 2030 significant increases occur for all pollutants in large parts 15 of the Arctic. Net global RFs from 2004–2030 of 53mWm− 2 (HIGH) and 73mWm− 2 (MFR) are similar to those found for preindustrial to present net global aircraft RF. The found warming contrasts the cooling from historical ship emissions. The reason for this difference and the higher global forcing for the MFR scenario is mainly the reduced future fuel sulfur content resulting in less cooling from sulfate aerosols.

1136782,Diesel Sulfur Content Impacts on Euro VI Soot-Free Vehicles: Considerations for Emerging Markets,2020,Yihao Xie and Francisco Posada and Ray Minjares,,Working Paper,2020-11,,,Euro VI diesel engines contribute significantly to vehicle emission reductions because they have advanced emission control aftertreatment systems for particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These systems are sensitive to the sulfur content in diesel fuel. and for this reason. most major vehicle markets have progressively limited fuel sulfur content to 10 parts per million (ppm). also known as ultralow-sulfur diesel. As emerging market nations adopt soot-free Euro VI emission standards for their new vehicles. they face a transition to ultralow-sulfur diesel. as well. But this fuel quality transition does not happen overnight. In some cases. Euro VI vehicles are fueled with higher sulfur content fuels during a nationwide transition. or due to regional fuel quality differences. Through a review of recent literature. this paper explores the impact of 50 ppm sulfur fuels on Euro VI technologies. We find that. while all emission control systems achieve maximum effectiveness around 10 ppm sulfur or less. some temporary exceedance of these levels can be tolerated without adverse effects. After short-term exposure to sulfur content at 50 ppm. adverse effects on emissions performance can be reversed with increases in exhaust gas temperatures. However. long-term exposure to 50 ppm sulfur introduces more serious challenges for real-world emissions compliance. including impaired diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) operation that leads to thermal degradation of diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. and direct poisoning of catalyst sites on DPFs and zeolite-SCRs.

Characterization of mercury emissions and their behavior were measured in six typical coal-fired power plants in China. During the tests. the flue gas was sampled simultaneously at inlet and outlet of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). electrostatic precipitators (ESP). and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) using the Ontario Hydro Method (OHM). The pulverized coal. bottom ash. fly ash and gypsum were also sampled in the field. Mercury concentrations in coal burned in the measured power plants ranged from 17 to 385 μg/kg. The mercury mass balances for the six power plants varied from 87 to 116% of the input coal mercury for the whole system. The total mercury concentrations in the flue gas from boilers were at the range of 1.92–27.15 μg/m3. which were significantly related to the mercury contents in burned coal.

Within this study we estimated the historical NOx emissions in China for the period 1995–2010. and calculated future NOx emissions every five years until 2030 under six emission scenarios. Driven by the fast growth of energy consumption. we estimate the NOx emissions in China increased rapidly from 11.0 Mt in 1995 to 26.1 Mt in 2010. Power plants. industry and transportation were major sources of NOx emissions. accounting for 28.4%. 34.0%. and 25.4% of the total NOx emissions in 2010. respectively. Two energy scenarios. a business as usual scenario (BAU) and an alternative policy scenario (PC). were developed to project future energy consumption. In 2030. total energy consumption is projected to increase by 64% and 27% from 2010 level respectively. Three sets of end-of-pipe pollution control measures. including baseline. progressive. and stringent control case. were developed for each energy scenario. thereby constituting six emission scenarios. By 2030. the total NOx emissions are projected to increase (compared to 2010) by 36% in the baseline while policy cases result in reduction up to 61% in the most ambitious case with stringent control measures. More than a third of the reduction achieved by 2030 between least and most ambitious scenario comes from power sector. and more than half is distributed equally between industry and transportation sectors.

The effect of all available meteorological variables on PM10 concentrations was estimated using Generalized Additive Models. Data from each season were treated separately. The most important variables affecting PM10 concentrations in winter. autumn and spring were wind gust. the precipitation rate of the previous day. the precipitation rate of the current day and the boundary layer depth. In summer. the most important variables were wind gust. Julian day and afternoon temperature. In addition. temperature was important in winter. A ""weekend effect"" was identified due to the selection of variable ""day of the week"" for some stations. Thursday contributes to an increase of 13% whereas Sunday contributes to a reduction of 12% of PM10 concentrations compared to Monday on average over 9 stations for the yearly data.

Joint observations of air pollution were conducted in five cities (Shanghai. Hangzhou. Ningbo. Suzhou and Nanjing) of the Yangtze River delta. and a heavy haze episode with visibility 2.9–9.8 km was observed from 28 May to 6 June 2011. The contribution of biomass burning was quantified using both ambient monitoring data and the WRF/CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ)) model simulation. It was found that the average and maximum daily PM2.5 concentrations during the episode were 82 and 144 μgm−3. respectively. Weather pattern analysis indicated that stagnation enhanced the accumulation of air pollutants. while the following precipitation event scavenged the pollution. Mixing depth during the stagnant period was 240–399 m. Estimation based on observation data and CMAQ model simulation indicated that biomass open burning contributed 37% of PM2.5. 70% of organic carbon and 61% of elemental carbon. Satellite-detected fire spots. back-trajectory analysis and air quality model simulation were integrated to identify the locations where the biomass was burned and the pollutants transport. The results suggested that the impact of biomass open burning is regional. due to the substantial inter-province transport of air pollutants. PM2.5 exposure level could be reduced 47% for the YRD region if complete biomass burning is forbidden and significant health benefit is expected.

The multiyear emissions of GHG (CO 2. CH 4 and N 2 O) from heavy-duty trucks fueled by diesel and natural gas during the period of 2006–2015 were compared and analyzed. The results show that the GHG emissions from heavy-duty trucks increase with time. which is consistent with the trend of the population growth. The total amount of carbon dioxide equivalence (CO 2 e) emissions in the BTH region was about 5.12× 10 6 t in 2015. Among the three sub-regions. Hebei possesses the largest number of heavy-duty trucks due to the size of its heavy-duty industries. As a consequence. the GHG emissions are about 10 times compared to Beijing and Tianjin. Tractor trailers account for the major proportion of heavy-duty trucks and hence contribute to about 74% of GHG emissions. Diesel-and liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered heavy-duty trucks can reduce GHG emissions more effectively under current national standard IV than can the previous standard. The widespread utilization of the alternative fuel of LNG to mitigate emissions must be accompanied with engine technology development in China.

Calculations with the DFT-NEGF methodology were performed in order to analyze this system at low values of mechanical strain (compression and distension) and at equilibrium length in the presence of bias voltages applied along the longitudinal direction. The results show that. while the mechanical strain displaces the energy levels and changes the band gap in the nanotube caps. the applied bias breaks the degeneracy in the nanotube cap states and defines the electrical conductance along the system.

However. each patient will present his particularities that will not necessarily imply his condemnation. The consolidated method for PD processing has high qualifications in the statistical analysis of insulation status of electric generators. However. although the IEEE 1434 standard has well-established standards. it will not always be simple to classify signals obtained in the measurement of the hydro generator coupler due to variations in the same type of PD incidence that may occur as a result of the uniqueness of each machine subject to staff evaluation. In order to streamline the machine diagnostic process. a tool is suggested in this article that will provide this signal classification feature. These measurements will be established in groups that represent each known form of partial discharge established by the literature. It was combined with supervised and unsupervised techniques to create a hybrid method that identified the patterns and classified the measurement signals. with a high degree of precision. This paper proposes the use of data-mining techniques based on clustering to group the characteristic patterns of PD in hydro generators. defined in standards.

Some existed conventional DC/DC converters have the disadvantages of large duty cycle. high switch voltage stress and high peak current. The proposed converter can provide very high voltage gain without extreme duty cycle due to the voltage doubler cell. which is composed of a coupled inductor. a switched capacitor and an additional diode. The converter with active clamp scheme can recycle the leakage energy. Unfortunately. it increases the topology complexity. The presented converter. which employs the passive lossless clamp circuit instead of the active clamp circuit. can achieve the similar functions and show better performance than its active-clamp counterpart.

1136959,Overview of supercapacitor voltage equalisation circuits for an electric vehicle charging application,2010,Simon Lambert and Volker Pickert and John Holden and Wuhua Li and Xiangning He,,,,1-7,IEEE,The ability to rapidly charge an electric vehicle is limited by the power available at the charging location. In a domestic charging application the power available is limited by the utility supply to the household. One method of increasing the available power without substantial alteration of the domestic wiring scheme is to use a bank of supercapacitors - `trickle charged' whilst the vehicle is not charging - to provide a power boost at the time of charging. Boosting the available power reduces the charge time for the vehicle.

A mixed calendar and cycling profile is defined and applied to a high power-density 16Ah pouch type battery. Whilst the capacity loss due to cycling is irreversible. the apparent capacity loss due relaxation/self-discharge is found to be pseudo-reversible. The characteristic voltage drop during relaxation is studied in detail. and shown to exhibit behavior which can be modelled using a dynamic time constant approach.

The proposed converter consists of an interleaved structure. a built-in transformer and two sets of active clamp circuits. The built-in transformer can provide high voltage conversion ratio and increase the system efficiency without an extreme duty cycle compared with the conventional boost converter. The leakage inductance of the built-in transformer removes the output diode reverse-recovery problem. The active clamp scheme can suppress the surge voltage of the power MOSFETs and recycle the leakage energy. The operation principle of the converter is analyzed and verified.

In this paper. synthesis and conductivity data for a range of doped samples (Mg. Ca. Sr. Ba. B. Ga and Zn) are reported. in particular. to compare the effect of rare earth vs Si site doping. The results show that Ga. B and Zn favour substitution on the Si site. while Ca. Sr and Ba favour La-site substitution. Mg is shown to be an ambi-site dopant. substituting on either site depending on the starting composition. The samples doped on the Si site show higher conductivities than comparable samples doped on the La site. providing further support for the importance of the silicate network in the conduction process. as initially predicted by atomistic modelling studies.

La3Zr2Li7O12. Without Ga doping. La3Zr2Li7O12 is tetragonal and has low Li ion conductivity. The introduction of Ga leads to a change to a cubic unit cell. and a large enhancement in the conductivity.

The terms DES and IL have been used interchangeably in the literature though it is necessary to point out that these are actually two different types of solvent. DESs are systems formed from a eutectic mixture of Lewis or Brønsted acids and bases which can contain a variety of anionic and/or cationic species; in contrast. ILs are formed from systems composed primarily of one type of discrete anion and cation. It is illustrated here that although the physical properties of DESs are similar to other ILs. their chemical properties suggest application areas which are significantly different.

Unlike the metals studied to date in these liquids. zinc electrodeposition is not mass transport limited and the morphology of the deposit differs in the two liquids. This study shows that changing the concentration of solute affects the physical properties of the liquid to different extents although this is found to not effect the morphology of the metal deposited. EXAFS was used to show that the speciation of zinc was the same in both liquids. Double layer capacitance studies showed differences between the two liquids and these are proposed to be due to the adsorption of a species on the electrode which is thought to be chloride. The differences in zinc morphology is attributed to blocking of certain crystal faces leading to deposition of small platelet shaped crystals in the glycol based liquid.,True,9eQK9kYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,127,https://pubs.rsc.org/--/content/articlehtml/2011/cp/c0cp02244f,10491574282181054,/scholar?cites=10491574282181054,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Abbott4/publication/51076571_Double_layer_effects_on_metal_nucleation_in_deep_eutectic_solvents/links/58b43fee92851cf7ae93e459/Double-layer-effects-on-metal-nucleation-in-deep-eutectic-solvents.pdf,0,0,0

These include: the development of columnar morphologies by micellar deposition. self-doping by attachment of anions. and the use of aryl sulfonates to promote cross-linking and hydrophilicity. The key to improved performance. especially in this last example. is the apparent coupling of doping processes to structural relaxations that encourage solvent uptake by the polymer and ready access for dopant ions to all available sites.

It is. however. shown that in ionic media the morphology of the deposits is markedly different from that achieved using a Watts nickel bath and that one aspect of these differences manifests itself in significant increase in the coating hardness.

Targets are modeled at three different levels of granularity (pixel level. parts-based level and bounding box level). which are cross-constrained to enable robust model relearning. The main contribution is an adaptive clustered decision tree method which dynamically selects the minimum combination of features necessary to sufficiently represent each target part at each frame. thereby providing robustness with computational efficiency. The adaptive clustered decision tree is implemented in two separate parts of the tracking algorithm: firstly to enable robust matching at the parts-based level between successive frames; and secondly to select the best superpixels for learning new parts of the target.

However. FCM exhibits poor robustness to noise. often leading to unsatisfactory segmentations on noisy images. Additionally. the FCM algorithm is sensitive to the choice of initial cluster centers. In order to solve these problems. this paper proposes clone kernel spatial FCM (CKS_FCM). which improves segmentation performance in several ways. First. in CKS_FCM. an immune clone algorithm is used to generate the initial cluster centers. which helps prevent the algorithm from converging on local optima. Second. CKS_FCM improves the robustness to noise by incorporating spatial information into the objective function of FCM. Third. CKS_FCM uses a non-Euclidean distance based on a kernels metric. instead of the Euclidean distance conventionally used in FCM. to enhance the segmentation accuracy (SA).

The tracking method builds on well-known methods for color-based tracking using particle filtering. but it extends these to handle fusion of color and thermal information when evaluating each particle. The key innovation is a method for continuously relearning local background models for each particle in each imaging modality. comparing these against a model of the foreground object being tracked. and thereby adaptively weighting the data fusion process in favor of whichever imaging modality is currently the most discriminating at each successive frame. The method is evaluated by testing on a variety of extremely challenging video sequences. in which people and other targets are tracked past occlusion. clutter. and …,True,ku5m3R88wlQC:e5wmG9Sq2KIC,58,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6548029/,8573205600158547066,/scholar?cites=8573205600158547066,,,0,0,0

These applications ideally require vision algorithms which are robust to camera motion and scene change but are cheap and fast enough to run on small. low power embedded systems.

The human visual system can often correctly interpret images that are of such poor quality that they contain insufficient explicit information to do so. We assert that such systems must therefore make use of prior knowledge in several forms.A tracking algorithm is presented which combines observed data (the current image) with predicted data derived from prior knowledge of the object being viewed and an estimate of the camera’s motion. During image segmentation. a predicted image is used to estimate class conditional distribution models and an Extended-Markov Random Field technique is used to combine observed image data with expectations of that data within a probabilistic framework.

Pushing is perhaps the most basic kind of manipulation. however it presents difficult challenges for planning. because of the complex relationship between manipulative pushing actions and resulting manipulandum motions. The motion planning literature has well developed paradigms for solving e.g. the piano-mover's problem. where the search occurs directly in the configuration space of the manipulandum object being moved. In contrast. in pushing manipulation. a plan must be built in the action space of the robot. which is only indirectly linked to the motion space of the manipulandum through a complex interaction for which inverse models may not be known.

Although further optimization from feasible solutions will typically lead in a direction that generates further feasible solutions. certain infeasible solutions can also provide useful information about the optimal direction of improvement for the objective function. How well an algorithm makes use of these two solutions determines its performance on COPs. This paper proposes a novel selection evolutionary strategy (NSES) for constrained optimization.

To accelerate its convergence. the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm selects nondominated solutions from the preliminary partitioning results as its initial population. Secondly. the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm finds solutions approximating the true Pareto optimal front through constantly selecting nondominated solutions from the population after crossover and mutation in iterations. which overcomes the tendency of data clustering methods to fall into local optima.

Models informed by mechanics are powerful. but are hard to tune. An alternative is to learn a model of the object’s motion from data. to learn to predict. We study this for push manipulation.

Our architecture is modular: many simple. object specific. and context specific predictors are learned. We show empirically that such predictors outperform a rigid body dynamics engine tuned on the same data. We then extend the density estimation approach using a product of experts.

The data show that the initial charge-carrying species are polarons. At higher potentials. bipolarons are also formed. and co-exist with the polarons; strongly suggesting that there is no appreciable energy gain in forming a bipolaron (with respect to two polarons).

In the absence of water and CO2. reduction of fac-[Re(dmbipy)(CO)3Cl](dmbipy = 4.4-dimethyl-2.2-bipyridyl) leads first to fac-[Re(dmbipy)(CO)3Cl] followed by elimination of Cl and partial dimerisation of the resultant five-co-ordinate species to give both fac-[Re(dmbipy)(CO)3] and [{Re(dmbipy)(CO)3}2].

The use of rice husks as a source of sustainable and renewable energy is often hindered by lack of capital and a poor understanding of rice husk combustion characteristics. This results in the selection of poor quality technology which generates significant quantities of harmful crystalline silica waste. Despite previous work in the area. detailed characterisation of the combustion of rice husk ash in a TORBED reactor across a wide temperature range has not yet been attempted and little effort has been directed towards assessing the economic viability of generating quality rice husk ashes.

However. recently only 5% of lithium ion batteries (LIBs) were recycled in the European Union. This paper explores why and how this can be improved by controlled dismantling. characterization and recycling. Currently. the favored disposal route for batteries is shredding of complete systems and then separation of individual fractions. This can be effective for the partial recovery of some materials. producing impure. mixed or contaminated waste streams. For an effective circular economy it would be beneficial to produce greater purity waste streams and be able to re-use (as well as recycle) some components; thus. a dismantling system could have advantages over shredding. This paper presents an alternative complete system disassembly process route for lithium ion batteries and examines the various processes required to enable material or component recovery. A schematic is presented of the entire process for all material components along with a materials recovery assay. Health and safety considerations and options for each stage of the process are also reported.

The current study explores hydrothermal Si extraction. fusion assisted extraction and a novel microwave fusion process with a performance comparable to the fusion process. The extraction process was optimised for the Delta ash. and compared to other ashes and rice husk ash.  In the optimisation of the crystallisation process. the influence of sodium aluminate addition on the properties of zeolites was examined. The effects of alkalinity. sodium source and salt concentration were investigated using XRD. SEM. AAS. CEC and PSD. A concurrent decrease in Si and Al in the crystallisation solution was observed as amorphous material was consumed. This crystal growth phase occurs earlier with higher concentrations of sodium aluminate and NaCl. Addition of NaCl can improve crystallinity. yield and CEC and decrease particle size. Optimised results demonstrated good repeatability. The best estimated yield was 264 g/kg FA. with a CEC of 4.8 meq/g.

However. in Europe. which is highly urbanized and one of the most advanced regions in terms of environmental policies. there is considerable diversity in the regional distribution. ambition and scope of climate change responses. This paper explores potential factors contributing to such diversity in 200 large and medium-sized cities across 11 European countries. We statistically investigate institutional. socio-economic. environmental and vulnerability characteristics of cities as potential drivers of or barriers to the development of urban climate change plans. Our results show that factors such as membership of climate networks. population size. GDP per capita and adaptive capacity act as drivers of mitigation and adaptation plans. By contrast. factors such as the unemployment rate. warmer summers. proximity to the coast and projected exposure to future climate impacts act as barriers. We see that. overall. it is predominantly large and prosperous cities that engage in climate planning. while vulnerable cities and those at risk of severe climate impacts in the future are less active. Our analysis suggests that climate change planning in European cities is not proactive. i.e. not significantly influenced by anticipated future impacts. Instead. we found that the current adaptive capacity of a city significantly relates to climate planning. Along with the need to further explore these relations. we see a need for more economic and institutional support for smaller and less resourceful cities and those at high risk from climate change impacts in …,True,m01HToIAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,96,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135597,10522888082689904507,/scholar?cites=10522888082689904507,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135597,0,0,0
1137103,A functional model of supply chains and waste,2004,C Hicks and O Heidrich and T McGovern and T Donnelly,89,International Journal of Production Economics,2,165-174,Elsevier,Waste management is a strategic supply chain issue. This paper explores the definition and classification of waste from different viewpoints. A generic functional model is presented for modelling the material and flow of waste from both a physical and cumulative cost perspective. The application of the model is illustrated through a case study. The research demonstrates that improved waste management practices can simultaneously reduce disposal cost as well as generating additional value through the creation of new supply chains that reuse or recycle materials.,True,m01HToIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,96,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925527303000458,10220898092370150,/scholar?cites=10220898092370150,,http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/56836/F7643165-3BFE-4A93-9735-4EDAA32537BB.pdf,0,0,0

Home Energy Management (HEM) controllers have been widely used for residential load management in a smart grid. Generally. residential load management aims to reduce the electricity bills and also curtail the Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR). In this paper. we design a HEM controller on the basis of four heuristic algorithms: Bacterial Foraging Optimization Algorithm (BFOA). Genetic Algorithm (GA). Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). and Wind Driven Optimization (WDO). Moreover. we proposed a hybrid algorithm which is Genetic BPSO (GBPSO). All the selected algorithms are tested with the consideration of essential home appliances in Real Time Pricing (RTP) environment. Simulation results show that each algorithm in the HEM controller reduces the electricity cost and curtails the PAR. GA based HEM controller performs relatively better in term of PAR reduction; it curtails approximately 34 …,True,m01HToIAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,77,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670717303074,6471091669104933288,/scholar?cites=6471091669104933288,,https://www.academia.edu/download/54870303/79.pdf,0,0,0

1137106,Environmental appraisal of green production systems: Challenges faced by small companies using life cycle assessment,2013,Oliver Heidrich and Abhishek Tiwary,51,International Journal of Production Research,19,5884-5896,Routledge,This paper presents a snapshot of key challenges encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) devoted to green production systems acting on the call to substantiate their environmental claims. It highlights the overriding barriers of SMEs to meeting the standards for conducting credible product life cycle assessment (LCA). in terms of accessibility to customised data and epistemological limitations. This is illustrated using a real-world example describing the material and process flows for a recycling company. We demonstrate that the rigour towards compiling large (and in some cases nested) data sets. involving expert know-how and adequate representation of system boundary can pose operational barriers. This is underpinned by complications of conducting green production and process-based LCA. deemed essential in ascertaining product and process sustainability.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of these strategies and the provision of infrastructures in 30 UK cities. with a specific emphasis on those strategies that are within the remit of cities and local authorities. The climate mitigation strategies and supporting documents were obtained from 30 UK cities recommended by the Urban Audit Methodology. We show that 13 cities mention EVs in their strategies. Analysing EV registrations and the EV infrastructures that is provided by cities we found that there is no statistical difference in the number of charging points or EVs between the cities that have EVs as part of their climate change mitigation strategy and those that do not.

Industrialisation. mass production and global supply chains have resulted in a disconnect between people. places. materials and design. Upcycling is reuse of discarded materials which results in an increase in ‘value’. We discuss the potential for creative upcycling to reconnect people with materials and establish cultures and communities of making. The reaction of the public to creative reuse is explored by creating a café structure made entirely from recycled materials. and this provides the starting point to consider the contexts in which upcycling occurs. the motivations for (and barriers to) reuse and upcycling. the potential benefits of upcycling in the context of affluent Western 'consumer' societies. and the scope for designers to imbue objects with the potential for creative reuse.

Although the environmental benefits of closed-loop recycling of plastics have been established through a number of life cycle studies. the benefits of open-loop recycling of plastics have not been examined for many substituted materials. This paper compares two equivalent sports-field drainage systems. one based on conventional sand and aggregate drainage materials. the other incorporating a novel drainage material produced from mixed plastics waste. The scope is confined to an analysis of primary energy consumption and global warming potential. It was found that the novel drainage system had lower global warming potential and primary energy consumption than the conventional system.

It may be achieved best by shifting from Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars to Electric Vehicles (EVs). However. the transition to a low carbon mode of transport will not be instantaneous and any policy or technological change implemented now will take years to have the desired effect. Within this paper we show how on-road emission factors of EVs and models of embedded CO2 in the vehicle production may be combined with statistics for vehicle uptake/replacement to forecast future transport emissions. We demonstrate that EVs. when compared to an efficient ICE. provide few benefits in terms of CO2 mitigation until 2030.

We show that photocurrent transients measured immediately (e.g. 100 μs) after a voltage step can provide direct evidence that this field screening exists. Just after a step to forward bias. the photocurrent transients are reversed in sign (i.e. inverted). and the magnitude of the inverted transients can be used to find an upper bound on the width of the space charge layers adjacent to the electrodes. This in turn provides a lower bound on the mobile charge concentration. which we find to be ≳1 × 1017 cm−3.

Excitation energy transfer between the dyes is used to extend the absorption ability of the LDS layer to λ=350 nm and increase the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the cells for wavelengths λ<540 nm. The observed increase in the EQE corresponds to a rise in the short circuit current density of 1.88 mA/cm2 under AM1.5G illumination spectra. which is equivalent to a 10% relative solar cell efficiency increase.

The electrical properties are fixed by the equilibrium conditions of the interdiffused structure and subsequent cooling of the layer in a Hg ambient. Indiffusion of Hg during cooldown can be prevented by the growth of a 1000‐Å‐thick cap layer of CdTe. X‐ray double‐crystal rocking curves for the 400 reflections have been measured to find whether IMP introduces any residual structure or strain into the CMT. For CMT grown onto CdTe/GaAs. a postgrowth anneal of 30 min or longer reduces rocking curve widths to below 100 arc s. with a best value of 55 arc s. The best value on CdTe substrates was 72 arc s.

This paper presents a tentative. provisional framework for analysing energy system transition. differential outcomes and the reasons for them. It suggests that energy system rules (in enabling or blocking change) and incentives (in making change economic or not) play an important role in shaping change. A provisional hypothesis is that the UK’s ability to make the transition to a sustainable energy system is constrained by the nature of its institutional system and policy paradigm; and because of this. a critical precondition for more innovation in the UK is the implementation of an appropriate governance system. A key insight is a need to understand ‘how and why’policies are implemented. of ‘how and why’changes in practices and outcomes are driven. and the links between the two. A provisional Theory of Managed Energy Transition is put forward that seeks to: firstly identify the linkages of politics. actors and agency to the ‘how’and ‘why’of energy policy implementation and delivery; and secondly. relate these to changes in practice and outcomes.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,22,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP4-IGov-theroy-of-change.pdf,6145186767639017521,/scholar?cites=6145186767639017521,,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP4-IGov-theroy-of-change.pdf,0,0,0

London,What is EU energy policy — and how successful is the EU in projecting it? Of course. posing questions about the nature of EU energy policy presumes that the EU has a collective energy policy. This has been a slowly emerging and contested area of EU competence — certainly in comparison with other sectors. The question of what EU energy policy is can be answered by pointing to the three ‘pillars’ that have historically constituted the objectives of EU energy policy: climate-change mitigation. energy supply security and establishing competitive. integrated markets (EC 2013a). EU energy policy might in this way be explained as the application of various strategies and instruments. and the establishment of institutions. in pursuit of these three objectives.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137502766_2,10275817646145721790,/scholar?cites=10275817646145721790,,,0,0,0
1137337,Understanding the politics of low carbon Transition: context. paradigms and power,2013,Caroline Kuzemko,1301,,,,EPG Working Paper: 1301. University of Exeter,Given the scale of challenge that climate change presents to society and the urgency implied by limited time frames a growing body of academic work is attempting to conceptualise complex socio-technical transitions. such as in energy systems. and how they take place. Much can be learnt from this literature about processes of transition. not least that they are underpinned by multiple interconnections that take place in a range of different areas. This literature also suggests that although radical changes in complex energy systems have historically taken place this low carbon transition is different–not least in that it is in part politically instigated. As part of governing successfully for transition. therefore. much of this literature concludes that political institutions need to become more directly involved in supporting the niche technology markets that have historically been fundamental to innovation and change. The socio-technical transitions literature has. however. tended not to explore or conceptualise the politics of transition in any great depth. Politics is often taken to be neutral or is reified and policies are assessed and recommended without analysis of whether these will work in specific contexts. Using new institutionalist concepts. such as policy paradigm theory and depoliticisation. this paper is one contribution towards filling this gap.

1137338,Re-scaling IPE: Local government. sustainable energy and change,2019,Caroline Kuzemko,26,Review of International Political Economy,1,80-103,Routledge,Sustainable energy has emerged as a new area of policy. in part as a response to greater political acceptance of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Local governments are understood to be potentially important actors here. but also as having been constrained in their political capacities by neoliberal political institutions and the centralised nature of energy systems. This paper combines insights from energy IPE. political geography. new institutionalism and socio-technical transitions to build a conceptual framework for analysing local sustainable energy policymaking in relation to a broad range of influencing factors. It explores the ways in which policy and material aspects of energy systems inter-relate; considers ways in which ideas. contestation and learning are fundamental to change; and understands local governments as actors in their own right rather than ‘takers’ of global or national rules.

We lay out the nature of codes and why they are important for achieving policy change. We then describe the way in which codes are governed. including reforms in the late 2000s and two more recent reviews. Three challenges for the codes system are then discussed in detail: complexity and fragmentation. and how these act as a barrier to new entrants; the gap between code objectives and high level policy aims; and the self-governance approach in a period of rapid transformation. These challenges point to the need for reform. We argue that the two official review processes currently underway are too narrow in nature and a more thorough-going approach is needed. An alternative agenda is then developed. We propose that code modification be undertaken by a dedicated code management body. This would not be located in the regulator (Ofgem) but in an independent system operator. We also suggest various ways of mitigating risk in such an arrangement. The ultimate aim is to make the process of writing industry codes to support policy innovation simple. transparent and technical.,True,hUAgEAcAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,7,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ML-Innovation-energy-industry-codes-in-GB1.pdf,13039740307992138109,/scholar?cites=13039740307992138109,,http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/igov/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ML-Innovation-energy-industry-codes-in-GB1.pdf,0,0,0

1137344,Energy governance. suppliers and demand side management,2015,Caroline Kuzemko,,"IGov Wesbite, University of Exeter",,,,This paper examines the policies. regulations. rules and incentives governing gas and electricity suppliers in Great Britain (GB) from the perspective of how far these have served to facilitate or prevent a shift towards a more sustainable energy system. The precise context is the desirability of a fundamental shift in the underlying design of the energy system from the supply to the demand side. This paper focuses just on the governance of gas and electricity suppliers. defined as incumbents or independents. in order to explore in detail how their practices enable or constrain greater demand management and how these outcomes relate to energy governance. Energy governance is. in turn. defined broadly as including policies. regulations and rules aimed at incentivising greater demand management as well as those aimed at delivering other public objectives (such as supply security). Indeed as a complex whole energy governance must in effect balance the desire for climate mitigation (and energy transition) with supply security and also with affordability. Examining energy governance as a whole. rather than focusing just on demand policies. has revealed the variety of corporate practices that it allows and rewards: vertical integration; incumbent business models driven by volume and scale; barriers to entry and expansion for independents; innovations in trading and cost cutting that outweigh those in demand management; poor customer service and higher prices per unit charged to vulnerable (often legacy) customers.

Yet efforts to adapt to climate change. as reported in the literature over the last decade and in selected case studies. have not led to substantial rates of implementation of adaptation actions despite substantial investments in adaptation science. Moreover. implemented actions have been mostly incremental and focused on proximate causes; there are far fewer reports of more systemic or transformative actions.

Existing landscape models. such as the “fragmentation model” (or patch‐matrix‐corridor model) and the “variegation model.” can be limited in their ability to explain complex patterns for different species and across multiple scales. An alternative approach is to conceptualize landscapes as overlaid species‐specific habitat contour maps. Key characteristics of this approach are that different species may respond differently to the same environmental conditions and at different spatial scales. Although similar approaches are being used in ecological modeling. there is much room for habitat contours as a useful conceptual tool.

To this end. two bodies of research should be integrated. namely ‘resilience thinking’ and ‘optimisation for conservation.’ both of which are highly policy relevant but to date have evolved largely separately. Resilience thinking provides an integrated perspective for analysis. emphasising the potential of nonlinear changes and the interdependency of social and ecological systems. By contrast. optimisation for conservation is an outcome-oriented tool that recognises resource scarcity and the need to make rational and transparent decisions.

To help develop more effective long‐term strategies. we present a conceptual framework of adaptation. The framework emphasizes that in order to ensure that existing problems are not exacerbated. adaptation must: (1) address both human‐induced and biophysical drivers of undesired ecological change; (2) maintain a diversity of future response options; and (3) nurture the kinds of human capacities that enable the uptake of those response options. These requirements are often not met when adaptation strategies rely on technological fixes. which tend to concentrate on coping with the biophysical symptoms of problems rather than addressing human behavioral causes.

Patches are a useful starting point for conservation efforts. but a focus on patches alone will not always achieve desired conservation outcomes. Conservation strategies in the grazing landscapes of southeastern Australia suggest that large patches of trees are widely regarded as ‘habitat’ while other forms of habitat are largely ignored. We provide data on birds and reptiles from the Nanangroe grazing landscape that illustrate the potential habitat value of areas located between large patches of trees – that is. the matrix. Despite evidence on its potential value. present conservation strategies rarely consider the matrix. Possible reasons for this bias relate to the economics of farming and the history of land use. the current environmental law framework. and also the reluctance of ecologists to study the matrix.

The world’s population grew to pass the six billion mark. We witnessed the birth of the mass market and the boom in mass production to satisfy its needs. As markets became more competitive. so formal marketing emerged and became increasingly important as a means by which companies could continue to grow their markets and their market shares. The comfortable assumption was that the allout pursuit of economic growth was the most beneficial strategy for development. because the wealth generated could be invested to improve the quality of life of those inside and outside the industrialized economies. At the beginning of the twenty-first century. the social and environmental consequences of the unquestioning pursuit of economic growth have become increasingly clear. Increasing levels of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. a hole in the ozone layer caused by CFC releases. widespread destruction of the rain forests. and a growing list of endangered species and ecosystems are just a few of the indicators that all is not well. By 2000. World Bank figures showed that nearly half the world’s population live on under $2 per day.For this half of the world. issues of consumer choice and sovereignty or discretionary spending have little meaning. and promises that the growth in the industrialized economies would lead to a better quality of life for them have generally not been fulfilled.

Sustainable consumption focuses on formulating equitable strategies that foster the highest quality of life. the efficient use of natural resources. and the effective satisfaction of human needs while simultaneously promoting equitable social development. economic competitiveness. and technological innovation. But this is a complex topic and. as the challenges of sustainability grow larger. there is a need to re-imagine how SCP policies can be formulated. governed and implemented. The EU-funded project"" Sustainable Consumption Research Exchanges""(SCORE!) consists of around 200 experts in the field of sustainable innovation and sustainable consumption. The SCORE! philosophy is that innovation in SCP policy can be achieved only if experts that understand business development.(sustainable) solution design. consumer behaviour and system innovation policy work together in shaping it. Sustainable technology design can be effective only if business can profitably make the products and consumers are attracted to them. To understand how this might effectively happen. the expertise of systems thinkers must be added to the mix.

1137384,Introduction to critical readings: Media and gender,2004,Cynthia Carter and Linda Steiner,1,Critical readings: Media and gender,,1-10,McGraw-Hill Education,The media are important for many reasons. including their long acknowledged power to represent ‘socially acceptable’ways of being or relating to others. as well as to allocate. or more usually withhold. public recognition. honour and status to groups of people. Already in the 1860s. for example. feminists in the UK and USA who were arguing for more progressive and egalitarian definitions of womanhood complained bitterly that the newspapers and magazines of the day either ridiculed or ignored the so-called ‘New Woman’–women who sought greater social. educational. political and economic rights. The suffragists (or ‘first wave’feminists) of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were nearly unanimous in calling for the establishment of their own periodicals–which many regarded as being crucial to the political campaigns around increased rights for women. one of the most important being the vote (see Holland. Chapter 4 in this volume. for a discussion of women’s historical relationship to the news). A century later. US feminist Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique (1963) emphasized the impact of popular women’s magazines. whose articles. fiction and advertising celebrated a very particular form of domestic. suburban femininity. one that operated in a sphere almost completely separate from that of men. In so doing. magazine content naturalized the idea that women’s ‘normal’sphere of operation and influence is not only completely separate from that of men. but also less socially valued (see Macdonald. Chapter 3 in this volume).,True,-Bmi2swAAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC,124,https://www.academia.edu/download/3991790/0335210988.pdf,10548777887735741353,/scholar?cites=10548777887735741353,,https://www.academia.edu/download/3991790/0335210988.pdf,0,0,0

The business opportunities are huge but developing product and service offerings and achieving competitive advantage means rethinking your business model from early creativity and design processes. through marketing and communication to pricing and supply. Designing for the Circular Economy highlights and explores ‘state of the art’research and industrial practice. highlighting CE as a source of: new business opportunities; radical business change; disruptive innovation; social change; and new consumer attitudes. The thirty-four chapters provide a comprehensive overview of issues related to product circularity from policy through to design and development. Chapters are designed to be easy to digest and include numerous examples. An important feature of the book is the case studies section that covers a diverse range of topics related to CE. business models and design and development in sectors ranging from construction to retail. clothing. technology and manufacturing. Designing for the Circular Economy will inform and educate any companies seeking to move their business models towards these emerging models of sustainability; organizations already working in the circular economy can benchmark their current activities and draw inspiration from new applications and an understanding of the changing social and political context.

The underlying mechanisms that facilitate these reaction processes are increasingly providing inspiration in synthetic chemistry. Substrate channelling. where intermediates between enzymatic steps are not in equilibrium with the bulk solution. enables increased efficiencies and yields in reaction and diffusion processes. Here. we review different mechanisms of substrate channelling found in nature and provide an overview of the analytical methods used to quantify these effects.

This is achieved through templating porphyrins on fumed amorphous silica that is removed after pyrolysis by etching with concentrated KOH.Detailed material characterization of the pyrolyzed materials is presented here. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of cobalt and iron porphyrins was used to elucidate the transformations of nitrogen. carbon. cobalt and iron species resulting from the heat treatment.

The results show that the formation of graphitic Co–N4 defect is energetically more favorable than the formation of graphitic Co–N2 defect. Furthermore graphitic Co–N4 defects are predicted to be stable at all potentials (U = 0–1.23 V) in the present study while Co–N2 defects are predicted to be unstable at high potentials. Therefore the Co–N4 defect is predicted to be the dominant in-plane graphitic defect in Co–Nx/C electrocatalysts.

The first step avoids integrating stiff ODEs during the unbounded search for initial estimates of model parameters. To avoid integration. a polynomial approximation of experimental data is generated. differentiated and compared directly to the ODE model. obtaining crude but physically plausible estimates for model parameters. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is used for the parameter search to overlook combinations of model parameters leading to undefined solutions of the stiff ODE. After initial estimates are determined. the second step numerically solves the ODE. This refines model parameter values through a bounded search.

The electrolyte is 40% KOH saturated with Co 2+ and the anode is nickel.

The reactivity and stability of single‐atom Pt species was explored for the industrially important light alkane dehydrogenation reaction. The single‐atom Pt/CeO2 catalysts are stable during propane dehydrogenation. but are not selective for propylene. DFT calculations show strong adsorption of the olefin produced. leading to further unwanted reactions. In contrast. when tin (Sn) is added to CeO2. the single‐atom Pt catalyst undergoes an activation phase where it transforms into Pt–Sn clusters under reaction conditions. Formation of small Pt–Sn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high selectivity towards propylene because of facile desorption of the product.

1137565,Advances in mixed‐reactant fuel cells,2005,AK Shukla and RK Raman and K Scott,5,,4,436-447,WILEY‐VCH Verlag,The mixed‐reactant fuel cell (MRFC) is a new concept. in which a mixture of aqueous fuel and gaseous oxygen (or air) flows directly through a porous anode‐electrolyte‐cathode structure or through a strip‐cell with an anode‐electrolyte‐cathode configuration. These structures can be single cells or parallel stacks of cells and may be in a planar. tubular or any other geometry. Selectivity in the electrocatalysts for MRFCs is mandatory to minimize mixed‐potential at the electrodes. which otherwise would reduce the available cell voltage and compromise the fuel efficiency. MRFC offers a cost effective solution in fuel cell design. since there is no need for gas‐tight structure within the stack and. as a consequence. considerable reduction in sealing. manifolding and reactants delivery structure is possible.

Correlation of Nafion loading with the activation polarization characteristics shows an initial increase of activity upto a loading of 1.3 mg/cm2 followed by a more gradual change with maxima at 1.9 mg/cm2 for both oxygen and air. This trend correlated well with the decrease in charge transfer resistance and increase in the electrochemically active surface area. The contributions to the linear ohmic polarization region of both the H2/O2 and H2/air performance are predominantly from ionic resistance as well as diffusional contributions in the catalyst layer.

By applying an electric potential. electrochemical synthesis shows promise for the selective production of valuable products1. Electrochemical reduction of biomass-derived substrates has attracted attention as a means of incorporating renewable energy and non-petroleum feedstocks to form a truly renewable process. To this end. many groups have begun investigating electrochemical biomass reduction using aldehydes as model compounds. Recently. Song et al studied benzaldehyde reduction on carbon supported Pt group metals. They show good catalytic activity and a strong metal dependency for activity. faradaic efficiency (FE). and reaction order. The strong metal dependency of these properties suggests the importance of metal-adsorbate interactions which are still not fully understood. To further this understanding. we have investigated benzaldehyde reduction on Pd. Pt. Cu. and Au using electrochemical and spectroscopic methods.

The chemical thermodynamics of the ceria–methane system reveal that coupling the reduction of ceria to the partial oxidation of methane enables isothermal cycling at temperatures as low as 1223 K with the additional production of high-quality syngas during the reduction step. The equilibrium non-stoichiometry of the oxidation step has a substantial impact on the conversion of the oxidizer to fuel. with important implications for cycle efficiency. A model of the process thermodynamics is used to evaluate the efficiency of the cycle and its sensitivity to oxidation non-stoichiometry. temperature. and concentration ratio.

The porous particle beds provide high surface area for the heterogeneous reactions. rapid heat and mass transfer. and low pressure drop. Redox cycling is accomplished by alternating flows of inert sweep gas and CO2 through the bed. The gas flow rates and cycle step durations are selected by scaling the results from small-scale experiments.

However. quite little is known about whether consumers will switch to a TOU tariff or what might increase uptake if switching rates are lower than required. This paper presents the results of a systematized review and meta-analysis combining the results of 66 measures of uptake to a variety of TOU tariffs across 27 studies conducted in six countries. It provides the first robust estimate of consumer demand and correlates of demand for TOU tariffs that is not based on the results from just a single study or tariff. Four main conclusions emerge. First. if consumers are left to opt-in to TOU tariffs. uptake could be as low as 1% unless efforts are made to close the intention-action gap. otherwise enrolment could reach 43%. Second. if enrolment is opt-out. uptake could approach 100%.

This paper considers how observers are nonetheless able to recognize objects that have undergone such changes. In particular the paper tests the hypothesis that observers rely on temporal correlations between different object views to decide whether they are views of the same object or not. In a series of experiments subjects were shown a sequence of views representing a slowly transforming object. Testing revealed that subjects had formed object representations which were directly influenced by the temporal characteristics of the training views. In particular. introducing spurious correlations between views of different people's heads caused subjects to regard those views as being of a single person. This rapid and robust overriding of basic generalization processes supports the view that our recognition system tracks the correlated appearance of views of objects across time. Such view associations appear to allow the visual system to solve the view invariance problem without recourse to complex illumination models for extracting 3D form. or the use of the image plane transformations required to make appearance-based comparisons.,True,VP6B3rkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,43,https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2122460,9896235904343975714,/scholar?cites=9896235904343975714,,https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2122460,0,0,0

The important novelty of our approach was that visual similarity was determined using an algorithm [1] instead of being judged subjectively. This similarity index takes colours and spatial frequencies into account. For each target. four distractors were selected that were (1) conceptually and visually similar. (2) only conceptually similar. (3) only visually similar. or (4) neither conceptually nor visually similar to the target image. Participants viewed 219 images with the instruction to memorize them. Memory for a subset of these images was tested subsequently. In Experiment 1. participants performed a two-alternative forced choice recognition task and in Experiment 2. a yes/no-recognition task. In Experiment 3. testing occurred after a delay of one week. We analyzed the distribution of errors depending on distractor type.

The aim is to create a theoretical model containing a broad range of influencing factors that can be used for hypothesis generation. Furthermore. the paper provides a framework for assessing how much of the observed diversity in comfort votes may arise from imprecise instruments through the assessment of various forms of validity. Current comfort models. both predictive and adaptive. focus on the prediction of conditions comfortable for an average person in order to derive comfort bands suitable for the majority of building occupants. Such models do not explain why we observe such a diversity of comfort votes from occupants of the same building. We argue that understanding diversity is important. both practically and scientifically. and that to do so we need to address the physiological. psychological. social. cultural and built-environmental conditions that give rise to observed diversity in comfort. It is expected that in doing so. the research community will both improve its scientific understanding of comfort. but also develop new ways of providing comfort that can create acceptable environments for more people using less energy.,True,VP6B3rkAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,16,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1502288/,14851167407065855151,/scholar?cites=14851167407065855151,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1502288/1/WC16_Shipworth.pdf,0,0,0

A paper published in Science found that just one third of psychology studies could be replicated when the study was run for a second time (OSC 2015). To our knowledge. there have been no attempted replications of energy efficiency studies; so can we be confident that the estimated energy savings from policy initiatives like the European roll out of smart meters will be realised? Or that electric vehicles will reduce carbon emissions by predicted levels? Or is energy heading towards its own reproducibility crisis? Researchers call for the increased use of randomised control trials (RCTs) to evaluate energy efficiency policy and the introduction of protocols or guidelines for conducting experiments (Vine et al. 2014; Frederiks et al. 2016). However. no guidelines for increasing reproducibility have been proposed. Moreover. RCTs are just one method for causal analysis and RCTs cannot answer all important causal questions.

We present a mathematical model that explains how the edge mode chirality can be switched via controlled distortions of the underlying lattice.

Introducing heptagons and pentagons (defects with topological charge) makes it easier to tile curved surfaces; for example. soccer balls based on the geodesic domes 1 of Buckminster Fuller have exactly 12 pentagons (positive charges). Interacting particles that invariably form hexagonal crystals on a plane exhibit fascinating scarred defect patterns on a sphere 2. 3. 4. Here we show that. for more general curved surfaces. curvature may be relaxed by pleats: uncharged lines of dislocations (topological dipoles) that vanish on the surface and play the same role as fabric pleats. We experimentally investigate crystal order on surfaces with spatially varying positive and negative curvature. On cylindrical capillary bridges. stretched to produce negative curvature. we observe a sequence of transitions—consistent with our energetic calculations—from no defects …,True,x-_6edMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,283,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09620,2463824595197164576,/scholar?cites=2463824595197164576,,,0,0,0

These folding motions exist due to an underlying topological invariant rather than a local imbalance between constraints and degrees of freedom.

Electrokinetic properties and colloidal stability were analyzed as a function of pH and ionic strength of the medium. Chitosan particles showed volume phase transitions (swelling/shrinking processes) when the physicochemical conditions of the medium were changed. Experimental data were mainly obtained by electrophoretic mobility measurements and by photon correlation spectroscopy and static light scattering techniques. Chitosan chains possess glucosamine groups that can be deprotonated if the pH increases. Therefore. modification of pH from acid to basic values caused a deswelling process based on a reduction of the intramolecular electric repulsions inside the particle mesh.

Accordingly. factors such as pH. temperature. or salt concentration can induce size changes. While the volume phase transition undergone by ionic microgels with addition of salt is reasonably well understood in terms of Donnan effects. the origin of these transitions in neutral microgels is devoid of such understanding. In this paper. the effects of electrolytes on the swelling behavior of neutral thermosensitive microgels are interpreted within the Flory-Rehner theory for the swelling of neutral gels. by considering that ionic concentration affects the entropic contribution to the Flory solvency χ parameter; this manifests macroscopically as particle deswelling.

However. it can be extremely difficult to probe exactly how the polymer acts to. eg. modify the streamwise near-wall eddies in a fully turbulent flow. Using a novel cross-slot flow configuration. we exploit a flow instability in order to create and study a single steady-state streamwise vortex. By quantitative experiment. we show how the addition of small quantities (parts per million) of a flexible polymer to a Newtonian solvent dramatically affects both the onset conditions for this instability and the subsequent growth of the axial vorticity. Complementary numerical simulations with a finitely extensible nonlinear elastic dumbbell model show that these modifications are due to the …,True,uIMNPd8AAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,31,https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041039,9171505477127065142,/scholar?cites=9171505477127065142,,https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.041039,0,0,0

The stability of the particles formed by inter-chain aggregation stems from the charged chemical groups attached at the sides of PNIPAM polymer chains. The particle formation is fully reversible—that is. it is possible to change from stable polymer solutions to stable colloidal dispersions and vice versa simply by varying temperature. In addition. we also demonstrate that the polymer LCST (lower critical solution temperature). the final particle size and the electrokinetic behavior of the particles formed are highly dependent on the electrolyte nature and salt concentration. These latter results are related to Hofmeister effects.

The origin of this non-DLVO interaction is related not only to the local structure of the water molecules located at the surface but also to the structure of those molecules involved in the hydration of the ions that surround the colloidal particles. Ruckenstein and co-workers have recently developed a new theory based on the coupling of double-layer and hydration interactions. Its validity was contrasted by their fitting of experimental data obtained with IgG−latex particles restabilized at high salt concentration. The theory details the important role played by the counterions in the stability at high salt concentrations by proposing an ion pair reaction forming surface dipoles. These surface dipoles are responsible of repulsive interactions between two approaching surfaces.

The average distance between defects. also called active length scale. depends on the competition between these forces. Here. in experiments with the microtubule/kinesin active nematic system. we show that the intrinsic active length scale loses its relevance under strong lateral confinement. Transitions are observed from chaotic to vortex lattices and defect-free unidirectional flows. Defects. which determine the active flow behaviour. are created and annihilated on the channel walls rather than in the bulk. and acquire a strong orientational order in narrow channels.

We find spontaneous chirality: despite the achiral nature of nematics the director configuration shows a handedness if the toroid is thick enough. In the chiral state the director field displays a double twist. whereas in the achiral state there is only bend deformation. The critical thickness increases as the difference between the twist and saddle-splay moduli grows. A positive saddle-splay modulus prefers alignment along the meridian of the bounding torus. and hence promotes a chiral configuration. The chiral–achiral transition mimics the order–disorder transition of the mean-field Ising model. The role of the magnetisation in the Ising model is played by the degree of twist. The role of the temperature is played by the aspect ratio of the torus.

In chapter 1. we explain how nematic liquid crystals confined in toroidal geometries undergo structural phase transitions depending on the slenderness of the confining toroid.  In chapter 2. we consider a system of active polar swimmers that align with their neighbors. When confined in the right geometry. the system will self-assemble into a state with topologically protected chiral acoustic modes. The chirality in this system manifests itself as a temporal one. rather than a spatial chirality.  Chapter 3 shows how systems of Yukawa charged active spinning dimers self-assemble into a crystal phase with spatiotemporal order. a liquid phase or a glass phase depending on the density. Depending on the phase and the confinement geometry of these systems of actively spinning dimers. the system will allow for rigid body rotations or edge currents.

Recently. mechanical lattices have been found to have similarly rich structure in their phononic excitations [6. 15]. giving rise to protected uni-directional edge modes whose existence was demonstrated in lattices of interacting gyroscopes and coupled pendula [11. 19. 23]. In all these cases. however. as well as in other topological metamaterials [6. 18]. the underlying structure was finely tuned. be it through periodicity. quasi-periodicity or isostaticity. Here we show that amorphous mechanical Chern insulators consisting of interacting gyroscopes can be readily constructed from arbitrary underlying structures. including hyperuniform. jammed. quasi-crystalline. and uniformly random arrangements. We find that local geometry and local interactions control the topology of the vibrational spectrum. allowing simple. local decorations to endow amorphous structures with protected edge modes—with a chirality of choice. Using a real-space generalization of the Chern number. we investigate the topology of our structures numerically. analytically and experimentally. The robustness of our approach enables the topological design and self-assembly of non-crystalline topological metamaterials on the micro and macro scale.The quintessential model for the mechanical behavior of materials is a network of masses connected by springs.

1137733,Conforming nanoparticle sheets to surfaces with Gaussian curvature,2020,Noah Mitchell,,,,31-51,Springer. Cham,Nanoparticle monolayer sheets are ultrathin inorganic-organic hybrid materials that combine highly controllable optical and electrical properties with mechanical flexibility and remarkable strength. Like other thin sheets. their low bending rigidity allows them to easily roll into or conform to cylindrical geometries. Nanoparticle monolayers not only can bend. but also cope with strain through local particle rearrangement and plastic deformation. This means that. unlike thin sheets such as paper or graphene. nanoparticle sheets can much more easily conform to surfaces with complex topography characterized by non-zero Gaussian curvature. like spherical caps or saddles. Here. we investigate the limits of nanoparticle monolayers’ ability to conform to substrates with Gaussian curvature by stamping nanoparticle sheets onto lattices of larger polystyrene spheres.

Spinning components give rise to band gaps and topologically protected wave transport along the system's boundaries. whether the gyroscopes are arranged in a lattice or in an amorphous configuration. Here. we examine the irrelevance of periodic order for generating topological gaps. Starting from the symplectic dynamics of our model metamaterial. we present a general method for predicting whether a gap exists and for approximating the Chern number using only local features of a network. bypassing the costly diagonalization of the system's dynamical matrix. We then study how strong disorder interacts with band topology in gyroscopic metamaterials and find that amorphous gyroscopic Chern insulators exhibit similar critical behavior to periodic lattices.

Making use of recent advances. we create vortex knots and links in viscous fluids and simulated superfluids and track their geometry through topology-changing reconnections. We find that the reassociation of vortex lines through a reconnection enables the transfer of helicity from links and knots to helical coils. This process is remarkably efficient. owing to the antiparallel orientation spontaneously adopted by the reconnecting vortices. Using a new method for quantifying the spatial helicity spectrum. we find that the reconnection process can be viewed as transferring helicity between scales. rather than dissipating it.

Therefore. such extracts are widely used in several technologies. In addition. saponins have demonstrated nontrivial bioactivity and are currently used as essential ingredients in vaccines. food supplements. and other health products. Previous preliminary studies showed that saponins have some peculiar surface properties. such as a very high surface modulus. that may have an important impact on the mechanisms of foam and emulsion stabilization. Here we present a detailed characterization of the main surface properties of highly purified aqueous extracts of Quillaja saponins.

To understand this. here we compare the stability of foams made with hydrophobin HFBII. Quillaja saponin. β-lactoglobulin or β-casein. Our experimental design eliminates the effects of coalescence and creaming. allowing us to study Ostwald ripening primarily. We observe that in HFBII foams. disproportionation is effectively stopped and the air bubbles size remains practically constant over the time of the experiment. We explain this with the large differences in surface rheological properties of the adsorbed layers. which were studied using small and large deformation surface dilational and shear rheology experiments. At low surface coverage we have mapped the system behaviour to the equivalent 2D polymer network having similar dilational modulus vs. surface pressure dependence. allowing us to introduce an equivalent molecular “hardness”.

Such layers undergo a transition from fluid to elastic solid films. The transition is detected as an increase in the error of the fit of the pendant-drop profile by means of the Laplace equation of capillarity. The relaxation of surface tension after interfacial expansion follows an exponential-decay law. which indicates adsorption kinetics under barrier control. The experimental data for the relaxation time suggest that the adsorption rate is determined by the balance of two opposing factors: (i) the barrier to detachment of protein molecules from bulk aggregates and (ii) the attraction of the detached molecules by the adsorption layer due to the hydrophobic surface force.

Stoyanov and Theodor D. Gurkov and Gichka G. Tsutsumanova,10,Nature Physics,8,606–612,Nature Publishing Group,Bursting of bubbles at an air/liquid interface is a familiar occurrence relevant to foam stability. cell cultures in bioreactors and ocean–atmosphere mass transfer. In the latter case. bubble-bursting leads to the dispersal of sea-water aerosols in the surrounding air. Here we show that bubbles bursting at a compound air/oil/water-with-surfactant interface can disperse submicrometre oil droplets in water. Dispersal results from the detachment of an oil spray from the bottom of the bubble towards water during bubble collapse.

In the absence of saponins. around 78% of the available cholesterol was solubilized in the simulated intestinal fluids. The addition of two extracts. Quillaja Dry (QD) and Sapindin (SAP). was found to decrease cholesterol bioaccessibility to 19% and 44%. respectively. For both extracts. the main mechanism of this effect is the displacement of cholesterol molecules from the bile salt micelles. leading to formation of cholesterol precipitates that cannot pass through the mucus layer of the intestine. QD decreased strongly the SFA bioaccessibility as well. from 69 to 9%. due to formation of calcium-SFA precipitates. while SAP had no effect on SFA.

We present two-phase lattice Boltzmann simulations of a Couette flow over structured surfaces with attached gas bubbles. Even though the bubbles add slippery surfaces to the channel. they can cause negative slip to appear due to the increased roughness. The simulation method used allows the bubbles to deform due to viscous stresses.

The possibility of specifying the exact position of the boundary. independently of other simulation parameters. simplifies the analysis of the system. For practical applications it should allow one to freely specify the direction of the flux. and it should be straightforward to implement in three dimensions. Furthermore. especially for parallelized solvers. it is of great advantage if the boundary condition can be applied locally. involving only information available on the current lattice site.

Here. an apparent slip is often detected which can have its origin in the misleading assumption of perfectly smooth boundaries. We investigate the problem by means of lattice Boltzmann simulations and introduce an “effective no-slip plane” at an intermediate position between peaks and valleys of the surface. Our simulations agree with analytical results for sinusoidal boundaries. but can be extended to arbitrary geometries and experimentally obtained data.

In this paper. we investigate the dynamics of a single viscous vesicle under confining shear as a general model system for red blood cells. capsules. or viscous droplets. The transition from the tank-treading to the tumbling motion can be triggered by the ratio between internal and external fluid viscosities. Here. we show that the transition can be induced solely by reducing the confinement. keeping the viscosity contrast constant.

In Veda. cow’s urine was compared to the nectar. In Susrut. several medicinal properties of cow’s urine have been mentioned and are known to cause weight loss. reversal of certain cardiac and kidney problems. indigestion. stomach ache. edema. etc. However. the literature and scripture did not mention the antigenotoxic properties of cow’s urine. Methods In the present investigation. the antigenotoxic/antioxidant properties of cow’s urine distillate and redistillate were studied in vitro. The antioxidant status and volatile fatty acid levels were determined. Actinomycin-D (0.1 µmol/L) and hydrogen peroxide (150 µmol/L) were used for inducing DNA strand break with 0.1% DMSO as negative control. Dose for the antigenotoxic effect of cow’s urine was chosen from the dose response study carried out earlier. Results Both actinomycin-D and H2O2 caused statistically significant DNA unwinding of 80% & 75% respectively (P< 0.001) as revealed by fluorimetric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU). and the damage could be protected with the redistilled cow’s urine distillate (1. 50 & 100 µL) in simultaneous treatment with genotoxic chemicals.

CA enzyme was immobilized in alginate beads. subsequently maintained its catalytic efficiency after sequential operational cycles. The immobilized beads showed better operational stability by retaining nearly 67% of its initial activity even after six cycles. Batch scale studies with free and immobilized enzyme revealed that the entrapped CA hydrates CO2 to bicarbonate and/or carbonate which was then made to react with Ca2+ ions to transform into calcite.

Chronic exposure to manganese is associated with neurotoxicity and correlated with the development of various neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. Oxidative stress mediated apoptotic cell death has been well established mechanism in manganese induced toxicity. Oxidative stress has a potential to alter the epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation. Epigenetic insight of manganese neurotoxicity in context of its correlation with the development of parkinsonism is poorly understood. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the -synuclein aggregation in the form of Lewy bodies in neuronal cells. Recent findings illustrate that manganese can cause overexpression of -synuclein. -Synuclein acts epigenetically via interaction with histone proteins in regulating apoptosis. -Synuclein also causes global DNA hypomethylation through sequestration of DNA methyltransferase in cytoplasm. An individual genetic difference may also have an influence on epigenetic susceptibility to manganese neurotoxicity and the development of Parkinson’s disease.

1137857,Operational analysis of natural gas combined cycle CHP plants: Energy performance and pollutant emissions,2016,Matteo Jarre and Michel Noussan and Alberto Poggio,100,Applied Thermal Engineering,,304-314,Pergamon,The natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) plants are among the best technologies for power production. especially when operating in combined heat and power (CHP) generation feeding a district heating (DH) network. Even if usually designed to operate with very high utilization factors. thus satisfying mainly the base load. nowadays these plants are often used also as backup power. This is due mainly to the necessity to compensate the non-programmable renewable energy sources (RES) production. and it can be done. thanks to the good flexibility of these plants. However. in off-design conditions. the energy performance and the pollutant emissions may not be as good as the expected nominal ones. In this paper. the real operation of three NGCC units has been analysed in detail by considering mean hourly data over several years.

For this reason strong integration between the flue gas cleaning system and the heat recovery system is required. To provide higher electrical efficiencies acid gas neutralization process has the major importance in flue gas cleaning system. At least four technologies are usually applied for acid gas removal: dry neutralization with Ca(OH)2 or with NaHCO3. semi-dry neutralization with milk of lime and wet scrubbing. Nowadays. wet scrubbers are rarely used as a result of the large amount of liquid effluents produced; wet scrubbing technology is often applied as a final treatment after a dry neutralization.

The commonly used technologies for acid gas removal are: (1) dry treatment with Ca(OH)2 or (2) with NaHCO3. (3) semi-dry process with Ca(OH)2 and (4) wet scrubbing. In some recent plants beside a wet cleaning system. a dry neutralization with Ca(OH)2 is used. The goal is to reduce the amount of acid to be removed in the wet treatment and the liquid effluents produced. The influence of these different technologies on the electrical efficiency was investigated by a detailed simulation of a WTE (Waste To Energy) plant with a capacity of about 100.000 t/y of MSW.

The necessity to increase the share of renewable energy within the sector is hindered by the difficulty to renew and refurbish the existing building stock. In this context. heat pumps can have an important role in helping increase the renewable share of thermal energy production for the civil sector. in particular in those countries in which the electricity generation mix has large contributions from renewable energy sources.

Hazards are possible due to the bonding of the heating system pipes to customer's grounding systems. as well as to possible high values of fault currents. These electrical safety issues due to grounding electrode interactions have been so far poorly treated in technical literature. District heating pipes are generally dielectrically separated in segments by means of insulating joints. A deeper analysis of such joints shows that the hot water circulating in the pipes may bypass their insulation. rendering the effectiveness of the dielectric separation strongly dependent on the joint geometry. and on the water electrical conductivity.

Hazards are possible due to the bonding of the heating system pipes to customers grounding systems. as well as to possible high values of fault currents. These electrical safety issues due to grounding electrode interactions have been so far poorly treated in technical literature. District heating pipes are generally dielectrically separated in segments by means of insulating joints. A deeper analysis of such joints shows that the hot water circulating in the pipes may bypass their insulation. rendering the effectiveness of the dielectric separation strongly dependent on the joint geometry. and on the water electrical conductivity.

An accurate and up-to-date knowledge of operational data is essential to guaranteeing the optimal management of the network. and this aspect will be even more crucial for the full deployment of Smart Grids. This work presents a data analysis of the electricity production at the country level. by considering some performance indicators based on primary energy consumption. the share of renewable energy sources. and CO 2 emissions. The results show a significant variability of the indicators. highlighting the need of an accurate knowledge of operational parameters as a support for future Smart Grid management algorithms based on multi-objective optimization of power generation. The renewable share of electricity production has a positive impact. both on the primary energy factor and on the CO 2 emission factor.

Titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) is analyzed/assessed and proposed as a new potential working fluid in Rankine Cycles. Besides its good thermodynamic properties. TiCl4 is in fact a fairly low cost. non-carcinogenic fluid. with zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) and it is currently employed in high temperature industrial processes. It is however very reactive with humid air and water. A preliminary thermodynamic analysis confirms its possible application in power plants with maximum temperature up to 500 °C. considerably higher than the ORC state-of-the-art technology. performing electrical efficiencies as high as 35–40%. This suggests the potential use of TiCl4 as an alternative fluid in ORCs allowing the exploitation of high temperature sources (up to 500 °C). typically used in steam cycles.

In sintesi. i quesiti a cui rispondere con la presente attività sono: quali sono le condizioni di fattibilità di un sistema innovativo cogenerativo di taglia non superiore a 1 MWel abbinabile ad una sorgente termica a sali fusi a temperatura di almeno 450 C? Quali sono i relativi vantaggi ottenibili. sia in termini energetici che economici?Dopo una rassegna critica dello stato dell’arte dei sistemi di conversione attualmente in commercio. si sono indagate le alternative aperte dalla disponibilità di una sorgente termica a temperature elevate. La necessità di garantire un’adeguata stabilità termica ha ristretto la scelta a pochi fluidi. Di fatto. le prestazioni di gran lunga più interessanti. sotto molteplici aspetti. sono offerte da un fluido (TiCl4). che. oltre a garantire la stabilità termica a temperature molto elevate e ad avere costi estremamente contenuti. presenta caratteristiche termodinamiche (punto critico. complessità molecolare. massa molecolare) ideali per l’accoppiamento con la sorgente termica considerata.

Primi risultati dell'indagine nazionale sul lavoro e telelavoro nel settore …,2020,Marina Penna and Bruna Felici and Roberta Roberto and Marco Rao and Alessandro Zini,,,,,ENEA,This report shows the results from the first national survey about remote working experiences in the public administration and public institutions. The survey examines the work and personal aspects of employees. along with their mobility behaviors and satisfaction. Administrations were interviewed to investigate the organization of telework/agile work and the conditions that supported the process. from the start to its diffusion. The results of the survey illustrate a case study of integrated policy. in which the multiple aspects related to work. innovation of the organizational structure in the Public Administration. well-being and work-life balance of employees. urban sustainable development are considered. The developed methodology allows an estimate of the reductions in fuel consumption and flue-gas emission. including GHG and pollutants. due to the daily travels avoided. The analysis of the results shows an interesting picture: the PA is undertaking a dynamic process. where the organization of work is reviewed to give value to the central position of the relation between the administration and the employees. The quantity and quality of time gained due to journeys avoided to the workplace allow people to experiment with new forms of daily resynchronization of work commitments with family and personal needs. The results show that organizations and people are being strengthened by the new vision. A general increase in efficiency. productivity and satisfaction is reported although there are still several weaknesses and strengths that require further intervention strategies.Il presente rapporto descrive i risultati della prima indagine nazionale rivolta …,True,l4mDQC0AAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,https://iris.enea.it/handle/20.500.12079/55813,2353338991055448828,/scholar?cites=2353338991055448828,,https://iris.enea.it/bitstream/20.500.12079/55813/1/Smart_Working_nella_PA.pdf,0,0,0

Questo lavoro aveva preso spunto dai risultati del Progetto Strategico Interreg Alcotra RENERFOR [1]. Le conclusioni del lavoro hanno messo in evidenza le rilevanti potenzialità offerte dalla metodologia LEB rispetto alle statistiche energetiche attualmente disponibili [2]. L’articolata struttura del modello è stata sviluppata in modo da poter rispondere completamente alle crescenti esigenze di statistica e pianificazione energetica locale determinate dagli obiettivi delle politiche comunitarie [3]. Analogamente. il modello è risultato adeguato a supportare statistiche e analisi settoriali quali. in particolare. quelle relative ai consumi finali del settore terziario pubblico. L’analisi svolta ha evidenziato come il grado di dettaglio richiesto sia significativamente più elevato rispetto a quello attualmente offerto dalla statistiche energetica convenzionale. Le verifiche condotte hanno indicato come una parte significativa dei dati necessari è già disponibile ed è attualmente utilizzata per la redazione dei Bilanci Energetici Regionali ENEA.

1137898,THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO LOW-CARBON ENERGY TRANSITION,2018,Alice Gorrino and Roberta Roberto and Daniele Russolillo,,,,,,The current short paper aims at explaining the approach of the Alpine Space IMEAS-Integrated and Multi-level Energy models for the Alpine Space-project (co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund through the INTERREG Alpine Space programme) to tackle what in literature is known as the “policy silo” problem. which is even more complicated when applied to low-carbon energy planning. strategies implementation and monitoring. Supra-national governments (as the EC). national and local governments. agencies. international. national and local private groups of interest can make a great difference to support building local economically viable and sustainable communities. Nevertheless. these actors can not make a difference if policies or strategies are fragmented at the different institutional levels of implementation or if the objectives are not harmonized or missing at some levels and the actors already cited do not communicate with each other. In times of large opportunities made possible by advanced and cheaper technology solutions. the innovation stream is usually blocked by non-technological problems such as missing incentive alignments and poor information flow amongst actors. IMEAS intends to analyse the silos that pertain to low-carbon energy transition. studying each silo and highlighting where the critical issues. barriers or opportunities exist. to ensure integration. A definition of silo is proposed. as well as a classification of multi-dimensional integration that goes beyond the classic multi-level governance known in literature by policy makers and practitioners.

TiCl4 is in fact a fairly low cost. non-carcinogenic fluid. with zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) and it is currently employed in high temperature industrial processes. It is however very reactive with humid air and water. A preliminary thermodynamic analysis confirms its possible application in power plants with maximum temperature up to 500 C. considerably higher than the ORC state-of-the-art technology. performing electrical efficiencies as high as 35-40%. This suggests the potential use of TiCl4 as an alternative fluid in ORCs allowing the exploitation of high temperature sources (up to 500 C). typically used in steam cycles.

1137904,Change processes in counseling: experiences in the use of Expressive and Transformative methods,,Roberta Roberto,,,,,,Human beings are constantly evolving. as in a dance between inside and outside. Our essence is changing. Some changes are due to our very nature as living beings (getting old. going through different health states. etc.). others are a consequence of our relationship with the environment in which we live. physical. working. relational. social and personal environment. All these elements lead to a continuous redefinition of the balance between our external and internal needs (who I am. what I want. how I feel. what I need. etc.) and requires from us an adaptation. the use (or the development) of the ability to respond in a syntonic way to the needs from the surrounding environment and from our internal one. Sometimes it is not easy to balance our responses to internal and external requests. to be in the dance. and we feel in difficulty. disoriented. But change is vital. and it can be a fascinating journey! We have many tools at our disposal: friendships. family. being in the nature. having a hobby. reading. attending courses. playing sports. etc. Sometimes we feel the need for a neutral person. a professional who can accompany the change. We can therefore also rely on the support of professionals and find a space for listening and reflection. in which we may explore our problems and strengthen our capacity to choose and change. This thesis explores some of the techniques used in the professional guidance offered by transformative and expressive counselors and deals with the change process they trigger in the clients.

Since then. the techno-economic feasibility of new cogeneration plants in different areas of application (industry. service. residential. etc.). along with the definition of their optimal operation. have inevitably undergone a radical change. In particular. with reference to the Italian case and according to the most recent ministerial guidelines following the new EU regulation. in the event that cogeneration power plants do not reach an established value in terms of overall efficiency. their operation has to be split into a CHP and a non-CHP portion with incentives proportional to the energy quantities pertaining to the CHP portion only. In the framework of high-efficiency cogeneration. the present study compares different CHP solutions to be coupled with the paper industry that. among all the industrial processes. appears to be the best suited for cogeneration applications. With reference to this particular industrial reality. energy. environmental. and economic performance parameters have been defined. analysed. and compared with the help of GateCycle software. Among the proposed CHP alternatives. results show that gas turbines are the most appropriate technology for paper industry processes.

This study aims to evaluate to what extent electricity storage can contribute to a significant renewable penetration by absorbing otherwise-curtailed renewable surplus and quantitatively defines the associated costs. Under a Smart Energy System perspective. a variety of future scenarios are defined for the Italian case based on a progressively increasing renewable and storage capacity feeding an ever-larger electrified demand mostly made up of electric vehicles and. to some extent. heat pumps and power-to-gas/liquid technologies. Results are compared in terms of crucial environmental and techno-economic indicators and discussed with respect to storage operating parameters. The outcome of this analysis reveals the remarkable role of electricity storage in increasing system flexibility and reducing. in the range 24–44%. the renewable capacity required to meet a given sustainability target.

1137916,Electrification of Transport and Residential Heating Sectors in Support of Renewable Penetration: Scenarios for the Italian Energy System,2019,B Sara and M Manno and N Michel and M Vellini,,,,,HR,The integration of significant shares of renewable energies poses remarkable issues strictly related to the intermittent nature of these sources. Nonetheless. solutions in support of such penetration in the electricity market exist and become particularly effective if conceived under a Smart Energy System perspective. so as to exploit potential synergies among the different energy sectors. With this respect. shifting programmable consumption from fossil fuels to electricity represents a measure to exploit the otherwise-curtailed renewable generation. In this study. the impact of electrification of both private transport and space heating is assessed for the Italian energy system with the help of EnergyPLAN software. quantified in terms of critical environmental and techno-economic indicators. thus evaluating to what extent increasing the electricity penetration supports the development of renewables and identifying possible optimal scenarios. Heating demand is thus fulfilled through alternative options including individual and centralized solutions. Results show that replacing natural gas boilers with heat pumps. while assuming a simultaneous penetration of electric vehicles in the conventional fleet. leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions in the Italian energy system.

In this context. the European Union has set very ambitious goals for 2030. Various scenarios were built and designed to achieve these 2030 targets in Europe and in Italy; in these scenarios the member states plan to increase renewable energy penetration and to improve energy efficiency. but these targets require many investments. In this paper different scenarios proposed for Italy. derived from European Union elaborations (EUCO) and the National Energy Strategy (NES). are analysed comparatively with the aim of quantifying the economic burden associated with the expected reduction of CO2 emissions. In the light of the costs calculated. this paper will propose other alternative configurations of the electricity sector. equally virtuous in environmental terms. but less impacting to economic level. Results show that the complete elimination of coal. as provided for by NES. is not as beneficial as other scenarios; however. it is clear that the key parameter for granting favourable performances is energy efficiency. in a way in which both renewable and non-renewable sources are used achieving the highest environmental objectives at the lowest cost.,True,v-HAOzYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://art.torvergata.it/handle/2108/220326,,,,,0,0,0

Electric vehicles can play a major role in the transition towards Smart Energy Systems. thanks to the synergies that can be implemented with the other sectors. in particular in the challenges related to energy storage. However. the related increase in electricity demand inevitably affects the strategic planning of the overall energy system as well as the definition of the optimal power generation mix. With this respect. the impact of electric vehicles may vary significantly depending on the country according to composition of both total primary energy supply and electricity generation.

In fact. the mismatch between renewable energy power generation and load curves. along with the need for grid stability. may lead to substantial curtailment when potential power generation exceeds electricity demand. In this respect. the surplus from renewable energies can be exploited to produce hydrogen via electrolysis. This concept is referred to as “Power-to-Gas”. often further categorized as “Powerto-Hydrogen”. and is rapidly emerging as a promising measure in support of a renewable energy penetration that allows the decarbonisation of energy generation without affecting grid reliability.This study evaluates the impact of Power-to-Hydrogen systems on future CO2-reduced scenarios. characterized by increasing shares of renewable energies and electric vehicles.

As a consequence of the establishment of this directive. the techno-economic feasibility of new cogeneration plants in different areas of application (industry. service. residential etc.) and their optimal operation have been deeply modified. The previous legislation considered the entire electricity production as cogeneration electricity if two parameters. primary energy saving and thermal limit. evaluated on an annual level. exceeded specific limit values. This old incentive scheme made the sizing of Italian cogeneration power plants be focused on the maximum electricity output. According to the new incentive scheme. however. if cogeneration power plants do not reach an established value of overall efficiency. it is necessary to split them in a CHP portion and a non-CHP portion and the incentives are proportional to the energy quantities pertaining to CHP portion only. This situation implies that cogeneration power plants designed on the basis of thermal demand are more rewarded. as opposed to what happened in the past. The main area of application of CHP systems is industry and. among the various sectors. paper industry appears the most suited to be matched with cogeneration.

Since then. the techno-economic feasibility of new cogeneration plants in different areas of application (industry. service. residential. etc.). along with the definition of their optimal operation. have inevitably undergone a radical change. In particular. with reference to the Italian case and according to the most recent ministerial guidelines following the new EU regulation. in the event that cogeneration power plants do not reach an established value in terms of overall efficiency. their operation has to be split into a CHP and a non-CHP portion with incentives proportional to the energy quantities pertaining to the CHP portion only. In the framework of high-efficiency cogeneration. the present study compares different CHP solutions to be coupled with the paper industry that. among all the industrial processes. appears to be the best suited for cogeneration applications. With reference to this particular industrial reality. energy. environmental. and economic performance parameters have been defined. analysed. and compared with the help of GateCycle software.

The induced pressure oscillations determine undesired disturbances on multiple injections. so that it is possible to have significant fluctuations in the volume of fuel injected during two consecutive injections of the same injector or of two successive injectors. when the dwell time is varied. The present paper aims at investigating the cause and effect relationship between the geometrical features of each component of the injection-system hydraulic circuit and the pressure wave dynamics. to provide a key to design optimization for effective multiple injection performance.

Int. Conf. Microgeneration Relat. Technol.,,,,Direct solar absorption has been considered often in the past as a possible configuration of solar thermal collectors for residential and small commercial applications. Of course. a direct absorption could improve the performance of solar collectors by skipping one step of the heat transfer mechanism of standard devices and by modifying the temperature distribution inside the collector. In fact. classical solar thermal collectors have a metal sheet as absorber. designed such that water has the minimum temperature in each transversal section. in order to collect as much as possible the solar thermal energy. On the other hand. in a direct configuration. the hottest part of the system is the operating fluid and this allows to have a more efficient conversion. Nanofluids. ie fluids with a suspension of nano-particles. as carbon nano-horns. could be a good and innovative family of absorbing fluids. for their higher absorption coefficient with respect to the base fluid and stability under moderate temperature gradients. Moreover. carbon nanohorns offer the significant advantage to be non-toxic unlike other carbon nanoparticles (eg carbon nanotubes).

1137992,On the effects of variation of thermal conductivity in buildings in the Italian construction sector,2018,Umberto Berardi and Lamberto Tronchin and Massimiliano Manfren and Benedetto Nastasi,11,Energies,4,872,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Stationary and dynamic heat and mass transfer analyses of building components are an essential part of energy efficient design of new and retrofitted buildings. Generally. a single constant thermal conductivity value is assumed for each material layer in construction components. However. the variability of thermal conductivity may depend on many factors; temperature and moisture content are among the most relevant ones. A linear temperature dependence of thermal conductivity has been found experimentally for materials made of inorganic fibers such as rockwool or fiberglass. showing lower thermal conductivities at lower temperatures. On the contrary. a nonlinear temperature dependence has been found for foamed insulation materials like polyisocyanurate. with a significant deviation from linear behavior. For this reason. thermal conductivity assumptions used in thermal calculations of construction components and in whole-building performance simulations have to be critically questioned. This study aims to evaluate how temperature affects thermal conductivity of materials in building components such as exterior walls and flat roofs in different climate conditions. Therefore. experimental conductivities measured for four common insulation materials have been used as a basis to simulate the behavior of typical construction components in three different Italian climate conditions. corresponding to the cities of Turin. Rome. and Palermo.

Direct and on-time use of electricity is the best way to integrate them. but the current energy demand of residential building stock is often mainly fuel-based. Switching from fuel to electric-driven heating systems could play a key role.

Constraints such as the lack of space. especially within the historical centers and architectural peculiarities. make the application of technologies for renewable energy production and storage a challenging issue. This study presents a prototype system consisting of using the renewable energy from a photovoltaic (PV) array to compress air for a later expansion to produce electricity when needed. The PV-integrated small-scale compressed air energy storage system is designed to address the architectural constraints. It is located in the unoccupied basement of the building. An energy analysis was carried out for assessing the performance of the proposed system. The novelty of this study is to introduce experimental data of a CAES (compressed air energy storage) prototype that is suitable for dwelling applications as well as integration accounting for architectural constraints. The simulation. which was carried out for an average summer day. shows that the compression phase absorbs 32% of the PV energy excess in a vessel of 1.7 m 3. and the expansion phase covers 21.9% of the dwelling energy demand. The electrical efficiency of a daily cycle is equal to 11.6%. If air is compressed at 225 bar instead of 30 bar. 96.0% of PV energy excess is stored in a volume of 0.25 m 3. with a production of 1.273 kWh. which is 26.0% of the demand.

A simulation model was applied to some case studies to evaluate how a low-temperature operation of an existing district heating system performs compared to the standard operation. by considering two different approaches:(1) a different control strategy involving nighttime operation to avoid the morning peak demand; and (2) the partial insulation of the buildings to decrease operation temperatures without the need of modifying the heating system of the users. Different temperatures were considered to evaluate a threshold based on the characteristics of the buildings supplied by the network. The results highlight an interesting potential for optimization of existing systems by tuning the control strategies and performing some energy efficiency operation. The network temperature can be decreased with a continuous operation of the system. or with energy efficiency intervention in buildings. and distributed heat pumps used as integration could provide significant advantages. Each solution has its own limitations and critical parameters. which are discussed …,True,JwtlfEkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,10,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/2/321,16664871205497621780,/scholar?cites=16664871205497621780,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/2/321/pdf,0,0,0

However. given the high variability of electricity mixes on a daily and seasonal basis. high-resolution profiles are needed for a precise analysis of the impacts of electric vehicles in terms of greenhouse gases emissions. This paper presents a comparison of different charging profiles evaluated on 10 European countries over four years. to highlight the effects of national electricity mixes and of the type of charging location on the specific emissions of EVs charging. This study. based on three archetypal charging profiles. provide a quantification of the potential influence of different charging strategies on the average emission factor of the electricity supplied to electric vehicles. The results show that the variability related to charging profiles is generally limited. with an average variation range of 6% for any given country and year. while in several countries the variability from one year to another is much larger. with an average range of 18% for any given country and charging profile.

While many studies are available on specific products. in recent years a growing interest is related to the analysis of services. including energy supply for final customers. Different LCA evaluations are available for electricity. while the heating and cooling sector has not yet been properly investigated. The objective of this study is the analysis of the specific impacts of the heat supplied to the final users connected to a district heating system. in comparison with traditional individual natural gas boilers. which represent the baseline heating solution in several urban contexts in Europe. The results show that the comparison is heavily dependent on the allocation method used for combined heat and power plant production. District Heating impact on heat supplied to the users can vary from 0.10 to 0.47 kg CO 2 eq/kWh. while distributed natural gas boilers present an overall impact equal to 0.27 kg CO 2 eq/kWh.

Our results show that interannual variation in nighttime light radiance is an effective proxy for predicting within-country changes in power consumption across all sectors. but only in lower-middle income countries. The result is robust to different econometric specifications. We discuss the key reasons behind this finding. The regions of Sub-Saharan Africa. Middle-East and North Africa. Latin America and the Caribbeans. and East Asia and the Pacific render a significant outcome. while changes in Europe. North America and South Asia are not successfully predicted by NTL.

These variable renewable energy sources require energy storage solutions to be integrated smoothly over different time steps. In the near future. batteries can provide short-term storage solutions and pumped-hydro storage can provide long-term energy storage with large generation capacities. However. none of these technologies can provide long-term energy storage in grids with small demand.

Here we provide empirical evidence of their impact on agricultural activity due to sectoral labour reallocation. Analysing daily satellite data in a non-parametric machine learning statistical framework over cropland in Badung. a highly populated regency of Bali. Indonesia. we generate a counterfactual synthetic Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) based on gradient boosted decision trees trained on a set of environmental variables assuming no lockdown occurrence. Based on the counterfactual. we estimate a significant increase in the EVI over cropland after the beginning of the lockdown period. The finding is robust to a placebo test. We then exploit the heterogeneity of the region analysed. where the South is dominated by tourism and the tertiary sector and the North is already mostly agricultural. and we find a stronger effect in the former. This results suggests that the observed increase in remotely sensed agricultural productivity indexes is likely driven by a labour force reallocation towards the primary sector to compensate for the income lost from previous employment.

The main options to achieve this task are the enlargement and reinforcement of the grid. the use of storage devices. and demand-side management. In this work. a multi-nodes modelling approach has been implemented to study the current situation of the Italian electric system. After evaluating the potentialities of variable renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic and wind power in terms of new installation and overall installed power. different scenarios have been developed. The final aim is to compare the single-node to the multi-nodes approach and to study the role of pumped hydro storage system as existing storage solution in Italy. At the increasing of the renewables generation. the results show the benefits in using the multi-nodes more complex methodology compared to the singlenode one. Considering the overall potential of Italian variable renewable generation within the system. the single-node model presents an under-estimation of the curtailments of about 7% and thus an over-estimation of the percentage of renewables in the system equal to 6.6%.

In order to achieve 100% renewables in any grid. the fundamental imbalance between the supply of the resource and demand must be alleviated.

In questo contesto. i modelli di sistemi energetici vengono utilizzati per produrre scenari e studiare le alternative future del sistema energetico. In questo lavoro viene proposta una classificazione dei modelli bottom-up di sistemi energetici insieme all'identificazione delle principali sfide di questo campo di ricerca. Queste sfide ruotano attorno al concetto di risoluzione. La risoluzione nel tempo. nello spazio. nei dettagli tecnico-economici e nell'accoppiamento settoriale sono stati identificati insieme a diversi livelli di risoluzione: bassa. media. alta.

However. these tools generally provide a spatial resolution of a few kilometers and. for a systematic analysis at large scale. they require continuous querying of their online databases. In this article. we present a methodology for fast estimation of the yearly sum of global solar irradiation and PV energy yield over large-scale territories. The proposed method relies on a multiple-regression model including only well-known geodata. such as latitude. altitude above sea level and average ambient temperature. Therefore. it is particularly suitable for a fast. preliminary. offline estimation of solar PV output and to analyze possible investments in new installations. Application of the method to a random set of 80 geographical locations throughout Europe and Africa yields a mean absolute percent error of 4.4% for the estimate of solar irradiation (13.6% maximum percent error) and of 4.3% for the prediction of photovoltaic electricity production (14.8% maximum percent error for free-standing installations; 15.4% for building-integrated ones). which are consistent with the general accuracy provided by the reference tools for this application.

The overall ABM framework takes into account social. technical. environmental. and economic aspects to evaluate the diffusion of PV technology in the urban context. A city district that includes 18720 households distributed over 1290 building blocks and a surface area of 2.47 km2 is used to test the proposed ABM framework.

Buildings can be considered as connected cyber-physical systems that require the construction of sound methodologies inherited from the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) research. In particular. aiming at autonomous buildings. the effective design of renewable energy sources is a key aspect for which such methodologies have to be developed. In this work. we propose a modeling strategy for the early estimation of the performance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Although a plethora of PV panel models there exists. most of these models suffer from accuracy/complexity tradeoffs.

Power demand is characterized by different heating cycles including sequences of various transient and steady-state phases. To effectively perform the predictive task by exploiting the huge amount of fine-grained energy-related data collected through Internet of Things (IoT) devices. innovative and scalable solutions should be devised. This paper presents PHi-CiB. a scalable full-stack distributed engine. addressing all tasks from energy-related data collection. to their integration. storage. analysis. and modeling. Heterogeneous data measurements (eg. power consumption in buildings. meteorological conditions) are collected through multiple hardware (eg. IoT devices) and software (eg. web services) entities. Such data are integrated and analyzed to predict the average power demand of each building for different time horizons. First. the transient and steady-state phases characterizing the heating cycle of each building are automatically identified; then the power-level forecasting is performed for each phase. To this aim. PHi-CiB relies on a pipeline of three algorithms: the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average. the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline. and the Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent.

Among the many actors at stake. the building sector energy management is one of the most critical. Indeed. buildings are responsible for 40% of total energy consumption only in Europe. affecting more than a third of the total pollution produced. Therefore. energy control policies of buildings (for example. forecast-based policies such as Demand Response and Demand Side Management) play a decisive role in reducing energy waste. On these premises. this paper presents an innovative methodology based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology for smart building indoor air-temperature forecasting. In detail. our methodology exploits a specialized Non-linear Autoregressive neural network for short-and medium-term predictions. envisioning two different exploitation:(i) on realistic artificial data and (ii) on real data collected by IoT devices deployed in the building. For this purpose. we designed and optimized four neural models. focusing respectively on three characterizing rooms and on the whole building.

From the other side. any new use cases should be tested and validated ex-ante before being deployed in the real-world system. Considering various types of actors in smart grids. use cases are usually tested using co-simulation platforms. Currently. there is no efficient co-simulation platform which supports interoperability analysis based on SGAM. In this paper. we present our developed test platform which offers a support to design new use cases based on SGAM. We used this platform to develop a new scheme for wide area monitoring of existing distribution systems under growing penetration of Photovoltaic production. Off-the-shelf solutions of state estimation for wide area monitoring are either used for passive distribution grids or applied to the active networks with wide measurement of distributed generators. Our proposed distribution state estimation algorithm does not require wide area measurements and relies on the data provided by a PV simulator we developed. This practical scheme is tested experimentally on a realistic urban distribution grid. The monitoring results shows a very low error rate of about 1% by using our PV simulator under high penetration of PV with about 30% error of load forecast. Using our SGAM-based platform. we could propose and examine an Internet-of-Things-based infrastructure to deploy the use case.

Thus. protective measures are put in place to reduce the risk of electric shock under both fault-free and single-fault conditions to levels considered acceptable by codes. technical standards. or authorities having jurisdiction. Protective measures must be compatible with the working environment. as well as with the skills and knowledge of workers. and may include strategies not just limited to the disconnection of the supply when faults occur.

1138093,An Analytical Evaluation of the Prospective  to Assess Short-Circuit Capabilities of Cables and Busways,2010,Michele Tartaglia and Massimo Mitolo,25,IEEE transactions on power delivery,3,1334-1339,IEEE,At the occurrence of three-phase or single-phase faults. abnormal levels of thermal energy are developed during the time taken by protective devices to clear them. By conservatively assuming an adiabatic process. all of the thermal let-through energy I 2 t. also referred to as Joule Integral. is accumulated within the components involved in short circuits; therefore. the temperature of their conductive materials is elevated. The thermal energy is proportional to the square of the short-circuit current. Evaluating the prospective I 2 t is. therefore. crucial in order to assess the short-circuit capability of cables and busways to withstand the thermal stress without failing or triggering fires in neighboring materials. In this paper. in the general case of resistive-inductive circuits. methods to evaluate the Joule Integral and to perform the assessment will be provided.

Notably. there has been voltage gain improvement without adding extra power switches. and a large number of passive components have advanced. Magnetically coupled isolated converters are suggested for the higher voltage gain. These converters use large size inductors. and thus the non-isolated traditional boost. Cuk and Sepic converters are modified to increase their gain by adding an extra switch. inductors and capacitors. These converters increase circuit complexity and become bulky. In this paper. we present a hybrid high voltage gain non-isolated single switch converter for photovoltaic applications. The proposed converter connects the standard conventional Cuk and boost converter in parallel for providing continuous current mode operation with the help of a single power switch. which gives less voltage stress on controlled switch and diodes. The proposed hybrid topology uses a single switch with a lower component-count and provides a higher voltage gain than non-isolated traditional converters. The converter circuit mode of operation. operating performance. mathematical derivations and steady-state exploration and circuit parameters design procedures are deliberated in detail.

The locations and actions associated with the particles describing a policy can be tuned by means of a recently introduced policy gradient method with parameter-based exploration. The task of selecting an appropriately sized set of particles is here solved through an iterative policy building scheme that adds new particles to improve the …,True,RgvpqjsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7303937/,2715230744997519774,/scholar?cites=2715230744997519774,,https://re.public.polimi.it/bitstream/11311/1006220/1/main.pdf,0,0,0
1138134,Analysis of different strategies for lowering the operation temperature in existing district heating networks,2019,Francesco Neirotti and Michel Noussan and Stefano Riverso and Giorgio Manganini,12,Energies,2,321,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,District heating systems have an important role in increasing the efficiency of the heating and cooling sector. especially when coupled to combined heat and power plants. However. in the transition towards decarbonization. current systems show some challenges for the integration of Renewable Energy Sources and Waste Heat. In particular. a crucial aspect is represented by the operating temperatures of the network. This paper analyzes two different approaches for the decrease of operation temperatures of existing networks. which are often supplying old buildings with a low degree of insulation. A simulation model was applied to some case studies to evaluate how a low-temperature operation of an existing district heating system performs compared to the standard operation. by considering two different approaches:(1) a different control strategy involving nighttime operation to avoid the morning peak demand; and (2) the partial insulation of the buildings to decrease operation temperatures without the need of modifying the heating system of the users. Different temperatures were considered to evaluate a threshold based on the characteristics of the buildings supplied by the network. The results highlight an interesting potential for optimization of existing systems by tuning the control strategies and performing some energy efficiency operation. The network temperature can be decreased with a continuous operation of the system. or with energy efficiency intervention in buildings. and distributed heat pumps used as integration could provide significant advantages. Each solution has its own limitations and critical parameters. which are discussed …,True,RgvpqjsAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,10,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/2/321,16664871205497621780,/scholar?cites=16664871205497621780,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/2/321/pdf,0,0,0

Despite the popularity of second-order methods in optimization literature. so far little attention has been paid to the extension of such techniques to face sequential decision problems.

In order to compute the Newton direction we provide the formulation of the Hessian of the expected return. a technique for variance reduction in the sample-based estimation and a finite sample analysis in the case of Normal distribution.

The objective is the design of the switching law so as to minimize an infinite-horizon expected cost. that penalizes frequent switchings. The optimal switching law is computed off-line. which allows an efficient online operation of the control via a state feedback policy. The latter associates a mode to each state and. as such. can be viewed as a classifier. In order to train such classifier-type controller one needs first to generate a set of training data in the form of optimal state-mode pairs. In the considered setting. this involves solving a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem for each pair.

The cost per power unit of the yearly capacity is lower than that of the monthly capacity. A high violation cost is paid when the actual power consumption in a month exceeds the pre-allocated capacity. Given that future power consumption is uncertain. we propose a solution that consists in the minimization of the average expected cost. which includes also the violation costs.

Distributed Energy Systems (DESs) have been recognized as a good option for sustainable development of future energy systems. With growing environmental concerns. design optimization of DESs through economic assessments only is not sufficient. To achieve long-run sustainability of energy supply. the key idea of this paper is to investigate exergy assessments in DES design optimization to attain rational use of energy resources while considering energy qualities of supply and demand. By using low-temperature sources for low-quality thermal demand. the waste of high-quality energy can be reduced. and the overall exergy efficiency can be increased.

The design problem of such systems is challenging due to the large number of degrees of freedom in the design and operation phases. so the system as a whole must be optimized. Moreover. both economic and low-carbon priorities should be considered in the design problem to foster an effective implementation and deployment. The aim of this paper was to present a methodology for the optimal design of multi-energy nanogrids (MENs) operating in grid-connected and islanded modes. Based on a pre-defined MEN superstructure. a multi-objective linear problem was established to find the types and sizes of the technologies in the MEN. with the aim to reduce the total annual cost and the fossil primary energy input. while satisfying the assigned time-varying user multi-energy demand. With reference to the latter. the thermal behavior of the building was simulated by using the dynamic simulation software TRNSYS. The Pareto frontier was found by minimizing a weighted sum of the total annual cost and fossil primary energy input. and the problem was solved by using branch-and-cut.

The latter should be reached by considering the concept of energy as well as exergy - the true magnitude of thermodynamic losses. Exergy describes the quality of an energy flow as the percentage that can be completely transformed into any other form of energy. Reduction of exergy losses represents a more efficient use of energy resources. which is essential in the long run. but it is not captured by standard energy costs. which are crucial in the short run. In this paper. exergy analysis is used in the context of a multi-carrier energy district to match the supply and demand not only in quantity but also in quality. The innovative contribution of this paper is the offering of a trade-off between reducing exergy losses and energy costs. thereby attaining sustainability of the energy district.

An experiment measured performance of a prototype minipleated filter panel made of commercial filter medium and obtained experimental data to validate the correlation. Issues related to the fluid flow field of the whole system were investigated through numerical analysis using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to analyze in detail the vector flow field and different turbulence models. The Reynolds stress model (RSM) turbulence model best described the experimental data.

The available knowledge and instruments provide a solid base for development of test methods to determine the effectiveness of filtration media for airborne nanoparticles down to a single-digit nanometer range. An inter-laboratory evaluation is performed under the Technical Committee 195 of European Committee for Standardization (CEN/TC195) for the development of the methodology to determine effectiveness of filtration media for airborne particles in the 3–500 nm range. Statistical analysis of the results was performed according to ISO 5725-2 in order to evaluate the test procedure and sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the factors that could possibly affect the test results. Inter-laboratory analysis revealed some deviation among the experimental results. The statistical analysis showed a less than 20% deviation. This deviation could be attributed to the difference among the experimental setups used by the laboratories. The sensitivity analyses did not indicate a strong influence by the temperature. relative humidity. flow distribution. challenging particle concentration. or particle density on the filtration efficiency in the parameter ranges used in the inter-laboratory test.

As a step toward deriving the effects of slip flow on the pressure drop in fibrous filters. we examine slip flow solutions for relatively simple geometries (sphere. cylinder. parallel plates and circular tube). Whilst the analytical approach is available for the sphere. parallel plate and tube geometries. a CFD solution is necessary for the cylindrical geometry. The results show that slip flow causes a pressure drop reduction in comparison to the noslip case for all these cases.

Hence. human exposure to nanoparticles is becoming increasingly a concern. Air filtration can be an effective way to reduce markedly the amount of nanoparticles inhaled in several instances. Nanofiber media is a promising media which can provide a greater filtration efficiency and higher performance than conventional fibrous filter media. A fiber is considered a nanofiber generally when its diameter is smaller than 500 nm. Fibrous media made with cellulose can be very effective in removing nanoparticles when coupled with a nanofiber layer on its top or at the bottom of the cellulose layer. The purpose of this study is to obtain a series of fiber diameters to be fitted in a lognormal distribution. Such distribution would be able to describe the size distribution of the fibers making up the nanofiber layer. The purpose of the whole process is to build a numerical model of the nanofiber filter media using another specific software package. The images of the nanofiber filter media were obtained with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Here we evaluate two different methods for obtaining the series of diameters. In both cases the image was divided in twelve equal parts to obtain a good number of intersection between the scribed lines and the fibers of the media. The entire image was analyzed starting from the left vertical line to the right vertical line. In the first method. we used the Image Pro Plus software package.

1138199,Modelling long-term electricity load demand for rural electrification planning,2019,Fabio Riva and Francesco Davide Sanvito and Francesco Tonini Tonini and Emanuela Colombo and Fabrizio Colombelli,,,,1-6,IEEE,Rural electrification plays a key role in terms of achieving the target of universal access to electricity by 2030. In order to deploy reliable and sustainable solutions. the sizing phase of decentralized power systems requires specific inputs such as long-term forecasts of the electricity load. In rural contexts. access to electricity is extremely interlinked to social-economic complex dimensions that in turn. influence the electricity demand. In this paper. we rely on System Dynamics for modelling such complexities. and we calibrate the results with data from a hydroelectric-based electrification programme implemented in 2005 in the rural community of Ikondo. Tanzania. We coupled the model with a newly extended version of a load stochastic tool. namely Lifetime - LoadProGen. in order to introduce a more reliable and calibrated approach to long-term electricity load forecasts.,True,iqoto1YAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,7,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8810727/,17657419957816021614,/scholar?cites=17657419957816021614,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fabio_Riva2/publication/335429147_Modelling_long-term_electricity_load_demand_for_rural_electrification_planning/links/5da6c59c299bf1c1e4c3866e/Modelling-long-term-electricity-load-demand-for-rural-electrification-planning.pdf,0,0,0

The availability of monitoring data is at the basis of the development of optimization models supporting an enhanced urban mobility. with multiple benefits including lower pollutants and CO 2 emissions. lower energy consumption. better transport management and land space use. This paper presents two datasets that represent time series with a high temporal resolution (five-minute time step) both for vehicles and bike sharing use in the city of Turin. located in Northern Italy. These high-resolution profiles have been obtained by the collection and elaboration of available online resources providing live information on traffic monitoring and bike sharing docking stations. The data are provided for the entire year 2018. and they represent an interesting basis for the evaluation of seasonal and daily variability patterns in urban mobility. These data may be used for different applications. ranging from the chronological distribution of mobility demand. to the estimation of passenger transport flows for the development of transport models in urban contexts. Moreover. traffic profiles are at the basis for the modeling of electric vehicles charging strategies and their interaction with the power grid.

Improved Cooking Stoves are promoted as a means to mitigate the economic. environmental and social implications of this practice. However. their diffusion is hindered by a number of factors. including in particular the lack of agreement on performance evaluation methodologies. Laboratory protocols are designed to give useful indications to cookstoves developers. in order to improve their performance under controlled conditions. while field protocols provide the assessment of real performance of a cookstove in a given context. However. due to high time and finance requirements of the latter. lab results are often used also for stoves selection. also because of a general misunderstanding regarding their correct utilisation.

These new operation profiles cause an increase of production costs and decrease of revenues. which undermines the competitiveness of the combined cycles. Power plant operators need tools to predict the effect of off-design operation and control mechanisms on the performance of the power plant. Traditional Thermodynamic or Thermoeconomic models may be unpractical for the operators. due to their complexity and the computational effort they require. This study proposes a Thermoeconomic Input–Output Analysis model for the on-and off-design performance prediction of energy systems. and applies it to La Casella Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plant. in Italy. It represents a stand-alone. reduced order model. where the cost structure of the plant products and the Thermoeconomic performance indicators are derived for on-and off-design conditions as functions of the load and of different control mechanisms. independently from the Thermodynamic model. The results of the application show that the Thermoeconomic Input–Output Analysis model is a suitable tool for power plant operators. able to derive the same information coming from traditional Thermoeconomic Analysis with reduced complexity and computational effort.

MPC is becoming more and more viable because of the increase in computational power of building automation systems and the availability of a significant amount of monitored building data. MPC has found successful implementation in building thermal regulation. fully exploiting the potential of building thermal mass. Moreover. MPC has been positively applied to active energy storage systems. as well as to the optimal management of on-site renewable energy sources. MPC also opens up several opportunities for enhancing energy efficiency in the operation of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems because of its ability to consider constraints. prediction of disturbances and multiple conflicting objectives. such as indoor thermal comfort and building energy demand. Despite the application of MPC algorithms in building control has been thoroughly investigated in various works. a unified framework that fully describes and formulates the implementation is still lacking. Firstly. this work introduces a common dictionary and taxonomy that gives a common ground to all the engineering disciplines involved in building design and control. Secondly the main scope of this paper is to define the MPC formulation framework and critically discuss the outcomes of different existing MPC algorithms for building and HVAC system management.

MPC is becoming more and more viable because of the increase in computational power of building automation systems and the availability of a significant amount of monitored building data. MPC has found successful implementation in building thermal regulation. fully exploiting the potential of building thermal mass. Moreover. MPC has been positively applied to active energy storage systems. as well as to the optimal management of on-site renewable energy sources. MPC also opens up several opportunities for enhancing energy efficiency in the operation of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems because of its ability to consider constraints. prediction of disturbances and multiple conflicting objectives. such as indoor thermal comfort and building energy demand. Despite the application of MPC algorithms in building control has been thoroughly investigated in various works. a unified framework that fully describes and formulates the implementation is still lacking. Firstly. this work introduces a common dictionary and taxonomy that gives a common ground to all the engineering disciplines involved in building design and control. Secondly the main scope of this paper is to define the MPC formulation framework and critically discuss the outcomes of different existing MPC algorithms for building and HVAC system management.

1138280,Innovative solar energy technologies and control algorithms for enhancing demand-side management in buildings,2020,Gianluca Serale,,,,,,The present thesis investigates innovative energy technologies and control algorithms for enhancing demand-side management in buildings. The work focuses on an innovative low-temperature solar thermal system for supplying space heating demand of buildings. This technology is used as a case study to explore possible solutions to fulfil the mismatch between energy production and its exploitation in building. This shortcoming represents the primary issue of renewable energy sources. Technologies enhancing the energy storage capacity and active demandside management or demand-response strategies must be implemented in buildings. For these purposes. it is possible to employ hardware or software solutions. The hardware solutions for thermal demand response of buildings are those technologies that allow the energy loads to be permanently shifted or mitigated. The software solutions for demand response are those that integrate an intelligent supervisory layer in the building automation (or management) systems.

1138281,Numerical Model for Solar Thermal Collectors and Thermal Energy Storages Based on Phase Change Slurry,2017,Gaia Prearo and Gianluca Serale and Marco Perino,,,,,,The efficiency of conventional solar thermal collectors and related thermal energy storages is often reduced by the requirement for high irradiation levels and the heat losses due to the relatively high temperature of the heat transfer fluid. In order to overcome those limitations. a solar thermal system capable of working at low temperatures through the exploitation of latent heat storage is presented in this paper. The proposed system was based on a novel heat transfer fluid and storage media. composed by a mixture of water and microencapsulated phase change material (PCM). named Phase Change Slurry (PCS). This paper introduces a numerical model capable of accurately describe the physical process and the dynamics of the proposed technology (collector. thermal energy storage and control logics). Results were validated by means of experimental tests and a long-term monitoring on a real full-scale prototype.

In a CGS. the high inlet natural gas (NG) pressure has to be reduced down to a much lower value. Pressure reduction is usually implemented by utilizing throttling valves. Due to the positive Joule–Thompson coefficient of NG. this pressure drop causes significant temperature fall and consequently hydrate forming in the NG stream. The hydrates may prevent stable NG flow through the pipeline. To prevent hydrate forming. the NG should be preheated by some heaters which burn huge amount of fuel.

The cascade storage system is generally divided into three reservoirs. commonly termed low. medium and high-pressure reservoirs. The pressures within these three reservoirs have huge effects on the performance of a CNG fuelling station and a fast filling process of natural gas vehicle’s (NGV) cylinder. A theoretical analysis is developed to study the effects of the reservoirs pressures and temperatures on the performance of the CNG station. The analysis is based on the first and the second law of thermodynamics. conservation of mass and ideal gas assumptions. The results show that as the reservoir temperature decreases. the fill ratio increases and the pressure within the filling station reservoirs has no effects on the fill ratio. The non-dimensional entropy generation and filling time profiles have opposite trends and as entropy generation decreases. the filling time increases. The optimized non-dimensional low and medium pressure-reservoir pressures are found to be as 0.24 and 0.58 respectively in thermodynamic point of view.,True,WBMvqvgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,23,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/pjct/15/1/article-p88.xml,5877410886403631782,/scholar?cites=5877410886403631782,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/pjct/15/1/article-p88.pdf,0,0,0

A simultaneous modelling of the flow and heat transfer within the cylinder and cylinder wall has not been considered in previous studies. Rapid filling may result to an unexpected temperature rise and breaching of the safety standards. In the present study. initially a correlation was developed based on a numerical simulation for predicting the heat transfer rate between in-cylinder flow and the cylinder inside wall. Then. a thermodynamic model was developed for predicting transient variations of temperature and pressure inside the cylinder and wall temperature during the filling. The model was applied to a type III onboard storage cylinder filling process. The numerical results are compared with previously measured values and showed good agreement. The results also show that a great portion of heat dissipation from the in-cylinder flow is stored in the cylinder wall.

The only deficiency of this system is the huge amount of fuel required to provide its heating demand. In this work. feasibility of employing evacuated tube solar thermal systems to supply the heating demand of the hybrid power plant is studied. After presenting detailed mathematical modeling. the solar heating units and other components of the power plant are properly sized.

The main drawback of this system is that in addition to the electricity consumption. it demands for a lot of heat in relatively high temperature range of 90–120 °C. though the solar system may provide a significant portion of this heating demand. On the other hand. in gas transmission systems. there are some expansion stations in which gas pressure is reduced considerably and this pressure drop causes temperature collapse in gas stream. Power productive gas expansion station (PPGES) is the most recent design proponed for these stations in which the unit is equipped with power generation systems.

The bed transient transport behaviors are discussed for all cycle phases. Complex flow patterns are found for isosteric heating and cooling phases due to the simultaneous occurrence of the adsorption and desorption processes. Furthermore. the effects of bed configurations such as fin spacing. bed height. and particle size on the performance of the system are examined. Results show that fins in general reduce the COP of the system; however. for a given total cooling power. the bed size can be reduced dramatically. when fins are employed at the cost of slightly lower COP.

The most commonly employed technique for resolving curved boundary problems is extrapolation of macroscopic properties at boundary nodes. Previous investigations have indicated that using more than one equation for extrapolation in boundary condition potentially causes abrupt changes in particle distributions. Therefore. a new curved boundary treatment is introduced to improve computational accuracy of the conventional stair-shaped approximation used in lattice Boltzmann simulations by using a unified equation for extrapolation of macroscopic variables.

Decreasing slip. increases drag in all Reynolds limits. but slip has smaller effects on drag coefficient at lower Reynolds number regimes.

The solution procedure is based upon forming a trial solution consisting of two parts. The first part directly satisfies the boundary conditions and therefore. contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is constructed such that the governing equation is satisfied inside the solution domain. while the boundary conditions remain untouched. This part involves a feed-forward neural network. containing adjustable parameters (the weights). which must be determined such that the resulting approximate error function is minimized.

1138394,Thermo–Economical Evaluation of Producing Liquefied Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids from Flare Gases,2018,Ehsan Barekat-Rezaei and Mahmood Farzaneh-Gord and Alireza Arjomand and Mohsen Jannatabadi and Mohammad Hossein Ahmadi and Wei-Mon Yan,11,Energies,7,1868,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In many industrial plants including petrochemicals and refineries. raw hydrocarbons (mostly flammable gas) are released during unplanned operations. These flammable gases (usually called flare gases) are sent to a combustor and the process is called flaring. Flaring wastes energy and produces environmental pollution. Consequently. recovering the flare gases is an important subject in these industries. In this work. an economical and technical analysis is presented for the production of valuable products. namely. liquefied natural gas and natural gas liquids from flare gas. The flare gas of Fajr Jam refinery. a refinery located in the south part of Iran. is selected as a case study. One of the issues in recovering flare gases is the nonconstant flow rate of these gases. For this reason. an auxiliary natural gas flow rate is employed to have a constant feed for the flare recovery process. The Poly Refrigerant Integrated Cycle Operations (PRICO) refrigeration cycle is employed for producing liquefied natural gas and natural gas liquids. In the PRICO cycle. the mixed refrigerant is used as the working fluid. The other issue is the existence of H 2 S in the flare gases. The main idea is that the flare gas components. including H 2 S. have different boiling points and it is possible to separate them. Consequently. flare gases are separated into several parts during a number of successive cooling and heating stages and passing through phase separators. It is shown that the proposed flare gas recovery process prevents burning of 12 million cubic meters of the gases with valuable hydrocarbons. which is almost 70% of the current flare gases.

The presence of multi wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) enhances the specific heat of the nanofluids considerably. and this enhancement decreases with increase of the MWCNT concentration. The maximum thermal conductivity enhancement reaches up to 19.75% for the nanofluid containing 0.45 vol.% MWCNT at 40 °C. At a lower temperature range. the increase in the viscosity is low compared to the higher temperature for all the nanofluids.

Methods/Analysis: A pacemaker is a medical device which uses electrical impulses to regulate the heartbeat. The lead inside the pacemaker cable fails due to various reasons. One such reason is lead fracture which occurs long after the implantation procedure. The pacemaker is considered as a multi-layered assembly with 1+ 6+ 12 helical wires and a straight cylindrical core has been chosen for analysing the mechanical properties which plays an important role in the failure of the lead cable. Any lead cable which is considered as rope has general equations of equilibrium. The mechanical property involves tr and force. strand twisting moment. strand axial strain and contact stress. The same mechanical properties are found by writing programs in MATLAB. Findings: The study of mechanical properties of lead cable used in cardiac pacemaker is as same as possible with that of the values checked with the equations of equilibrium and the variations are also less than 2 percentage. Novelty/Improvements: With the change in orientation of helix angle which is always assumed to be constant. is made as 82.53/-75.62. 73.29/62.36 and 62.24/-71.02.

Proc.,2,86-92,,Concrete industry. the largest consumer of natural resources such as water. sand and crushing stone needs to be reoriented by adopting environmental friendly and a highly sustainable technology. Concrete with ceramic industrial waste is termed as Ceracrete. The properties of the ingredients of concrete need comparison before replacing the fine aggregate (FA) and coarse aggregate (CA) by ceramic waste. River sand is used as fine aggregate and broken stone as coarse aggregate. Then the concrete mix is designed as per the IS code provision for M20 grade. Concrete cubes are cast by replacing FA and CA by ceramic waste from 0% to 50% in steps of 10% as type 1 (FA replacement). type 2 (CA replacement) and type 3 (FA and CA replacement). The compressive strength and workability of three types of concrete are compared with those of the conventional concrete (0% replacement). Fine aggregate replacement by ceramic waste (type 1) shows better compressive strength than type 2. type 3 and conventional concrete. But the water absorption of type 1 concrete is higher. compared to the other types. The workability of the type 1 concrete is smaller. The optimum percentage of replacement of type 1 concrete is found by design of experiments using the Taguchi method. Concrete with good workability and higher compressive strength is observed for 6.62% to 13.97% of replacement of fine aggregate by ceramic waste. whereas. the water absorption for this optimum percentage of replacement is similar to that of the conventional concrete. Hence ceramic waste is used as a replacement material for fine aggregate in the field of construction …,True,qXdK0BoAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subathra_Devi_Venkatachalam/publication/321126922_Investigation_of_novel_sustainable_concrete_using_optimization_technique/links/5a18168c4585155c26a7c4a9/Investigation-of-novel-sustainable-concrete-using-optimization-technique.pdf,7246225470483237223,/scholar?cites=7246225470483237223,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subathra_Devi_Venkatachalam/publication/321126922_Investigation_of_novel_sustainable_concrete_using_optimization_technique/links/5a18168c4585155c26a7c4a9/Investigation-of-novel-sustainable-concrete-using-optimization-technique.pdf,0,0,0

During the insertion process. the microneedle may fail due to the bending and buckling effect. The failure of the microneedle will lead to the entry of foreign particles into the human skin which further creates a hazardous situation. The major failure of microneedle occurs due to the buckling effect. The buckling of microneedle occurs when the applied load exceeds the critical buckling load (Pcr). In this paper. the buckling of the microneedle is simulated to find the critical buckling load. The simulation of buckling analysis is done using linear and non-linear methods for different interpretations.

In this case. present design of car front crash zone is made as a compromise reconciling requirements of frontal crash tests with and without offset. Using the principle of pyrotechnic detachable connectors. a control of car deceleration is possible. System controller recognizing initial pre-crash parameters (velocity. mass. stiffness and overlap) can choose several levels of dissipated energy for each absorber. Three methodologies with different levels of simplification have been chosen to calculate absorbed energy and levels of deceleration. A simplified analytical. numerical Lumped Mass–Spring (LMS) model and numerical FE explicit models of car front structures were created. Two crash scenarios were analyzed: full front crash and 50% offset crash for two cases: with an unmodified vehicle and when the absorbing structure was equipped in adaptive system.

Using LS-Dyna Explicit software. a finite element model was designed to simulate the nanoindentation process of a two-dimensional MXene Ti 3 C 2 T z monolayer flake and to validate the material model. For the evaluation of the adhesive strength of the free-standing Ti 3 C 2 T z-based film. the model comprised single-layered MXene nanosheets with a specific number of individual flakes. and the reverse engineering method with a curve fitting approach was used. The interlaminar shear strength. in-plane stiffness. and shear energy release rate of MXene film were predicted using this approach. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that interlaminar shear strength and in-plane stiffness have the largest influence on the mechanical behavior of MXene film under tension. while the shear energy release rate mainly affects the interlaminar damage properties of nanosheets.

For small scale laboratory experiments. low-energy-dissipation absorber was developed. Prismatic absorber made of thin lead sheets can dissipate the impact energy at two energy density levels. Moving the concept to the real steel or aluminum structures can lead to satisfying value of the Specific Energy Absorption indicator with possible control of the energy dissipation. Experimental and FE explicit simulation results showing controllable impact process of a thinwalled prismatic absorber with rectangular crossection are presented. The control of crushing forces proved to be possible and efficient. Adaptivity ratio achieved in the presented example was 35%.

The results showed that. the lowest stress forms in such elastomeric material that exhibit the lowest stiffness changes of matrix adjacent zones. If at low elongation ratio values the principal stresses of porous elastomeric polymer material are similar to those of non-porous material with the same mechanical properties as the matrix. at high elongation ratio the principal stresses of porous material are 1.5–3 times higher than those of non-porous one. The results of experimental tests provide good agreement with these numerically obtained but the phenomenon of strengthening was observed as the higher stress than true stress at fracture of matrix material appears.

In addition. the receipts from tourism contribute substantially in financing the current account deficit of the balance of payments in this country. These are convincing arguments to justify the analysis of the determinants of the demand for tourism in Portugal and might constitute an important guide-line for the policy making institutions.Empirical studies on this field for Portugal have shown little attention in modelling appropriately the demand function for tourism and identifying the main sources of tourism flows. The majority of studies take into account the demand side determinants of tourism. usually proxied by income and price measurements. and little attention has been given to the supply factors which might influence substantially the tourism performance. Factors such as infrastructures in networks and accommodation capacity in the hosting country have been ignored in such studies.

It is now largely accepted that the Maastricht norms reinforced by the Stability Pact have imposed serious macroeconomic constraints on economic performance by not taking into account specific problems of the individual economies.

1138597,Per capita income convergence across countries and across regions in the European Union: some new evidence,1998,Alfredo Marques and Elias Soukiazis,19,Journal of Economic Surveys,3,389-420,,There is a great interest in the EU for measuring disparities between countries and between regions. The preoccupation for sustainable regional growth. especially for the less developed economies is manifested earlier during the effort for the completion of the single market and more recently during the process which will establish the economic and monetary union. In the economic literature devoted to the integration theory. there are two distinct positions relative to the process of regional growth and the catching up hypothesis. The first. is the thesis of regional divergence. which argues that a higher integration towards a single currency is expected to increase factor mobility which can be in favour of the prosperous regions. Concentration of economic activity to these attractive centres which dispose more developed markets and higher level of industrialisation can create additional difficulties to the less developed regions and delay their catching up process. The second. is the thesis of regional convergence arguing that a higher integration will attenuate the initial regional disparities and in the long run the tendency is regional convergence rather than divergence. According to the convergence argument the fact that the USA shows lower regional disparities than the European Union is the result of a deeper economic integration. including monetary integration and a common currency. Consequently. there are additional reasons for a faster integration in the EU through the establishment of the monetary union.

In second place. we examine the relevance of Structural Funds (European Regional Development Funds) as conditioning factors influencing the convergence process in Portugal and to what extent these funds contributed to the growth of regional per capita income. In doing so. we apply a panel data approach to the convergence in per capita income among the 30 NUTS III regions in Portugal. and a separate analysis is given for the regions constituting the “Littoral” and “Interior” zones. The evidence shows that the distinction between the “Littoral” and “Interior” areas is important in the convergence process in Portugal and that convergence is slightly faster in the regions of the “Interior”.

In section 1 three main theoretical approaches are brought together to explain the convergence phenomenon: the neo-classical approach of unconditional convergence. the “endogenous growth” theory of conditional convergence. and the demand orientated approach of cumulative growth. which predicts divergence as the most probable outcome. Section 2 explains the sources of unconditional convergence in the light of the empirical evidence that gives support to this result. Section 3 analyses the sources of conditional convergence making reference to the empirical studies which identify the main conditioning factors which lead to convergence. Section 4 evaluates the relevance and explains the limitations of the conventional approaches to convergence. Section 5 describes the cumulative approach to convergence or divergence as an alternative method for understanding the differences in growth rates between economies. Section 6 concludes. pointing out the reasons which make the cumulative approach to growth the most relevant approach in explaining differences in the living standards of regions and countries.,True,7arJ0okAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,20,https://www.academia.edu/download/41892872/What_have_we_Learnt_About_Convergence_in20160202-27205-1992lop.pdf,7234381828310593780,/scholar?cites=7234381828310593780,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41892872/What_have_we_Learnt_About_Convergence_in20160202-27205-1992lop.pdf,0,0,0

The empirical study uses the familiar approaches of σ-sigma and β-beta convergence (absolute and conditional) based on a cross section analysis. σ-sigma convergence intends to measure the dispersion of per capita income across the Portuguese regions over time. Absolute convergence tests the hypothesis of a negative relationship between the growth of per capita income and the initial level. According to the neo-classical theory this negative relationship is evidence that poor economies grow faster than rich economies because of diminishing returns to capital characteristics. Conditional convergence. on the other hand. testes the hypothesis that convergence in per capita income is due to structural changes. by transferring resources from less productive (agriculture) to more productive activities (industry and services). Important structural variables. such as capital accumulation. human capital qualification. I&D and trade are. among others. conditioning factors that explain real convergence.

The study is applied to data from EU regions (EU12) in the most recent programming periods where data are available. The results suggest an improvement of the Funds efficiency in growth in 2000–2006 when compared to the previous programming period. Moreover. the returns from investments of Funds tend to be higher in richer. higher-educated and more innovative regions.

Grupo de Estudos Monetários e Financeiros,The present study aims to verify whether the balance-of-payments constrained growth approach is suitable for explaining the Portuguese growth performance during the last decades. For that. we adopt “Thirlwall’s Law” that predicts actual growth by the ratio of the exports growth relative to the income-elasticity of the demand for imports. The income-elasticity of imports. essential for the entire analysis. is obtained from the estimation of the imports function by 2SLS. assuming that domestic growth is endogenous. To smooth cyclical variations. 15-year overlapping periods are considered in the computation of “Thirlwall’s Law”. assuming that income-elasticity with respect to imports is either constant or variable over time. It is found that the Law is a good instrument for predicting actual growth in Portugal and this result is reinforced by performing the McCombie test. Our results reveal that Portugal grew slightly higher relatively to the OECD countries in the entire period and this is consistent with the income-elasticity of the demand for exports exceeding that of imports. as “Thirlwall’s Law” implies. Portugal also grew slightly faster than the rate consistent with the balance-of-payments equilibrium. accumulating external deficits over time. Dividing the sample in the pre and post-adhesion period to the EU. it is shown that Portugal grew at a lower rate in the latter. and this is consistent with lower export growth and higher income-elasticity with respect to imports.

1138642,The interaction between human capital. foreign trade and economic growth: an empirical approach,2011,Micaela Andreia Alegria Antunes,,,,,,Along this dissertation we present five distinct studies. following different approaches but all with a common element: they take into account the impact of foreign trade on growth. the relevance of the balance-of-payments as a constraint to growth and the linkages between human capital and external trade. The study begins with the analysis of the role of human capital and foreign trade on the growth of several sets of countries (World. high-. middle- and low-income countries. Europe. OECD and the EMU countries). between 1980 and 2000. The human capital proxies used take into account quantitative and qualitative aspects to measure their impact on growth. The degree of openness and the net foreign balance are used as proxies for external trade to reveal their importance on growth as well. The interaction between human capital and foreign trade measures allows us to investigate the existence of technology and knowledge transfers. through trade. We also consider the EU set of countries checking for the existence of conditional convergence over the period 1980 to 2004. In this part we try to reconcile the neoclassical and Post-Keynesian theories of growth at least at the empirical level. To do so. we introduce into the neoclassical growth model the ratio of the incomeelasticity of the demand for exports over that of imports. to test the importance of the balance-of-payments constraint hypothesis on growth. It is shown that this demand factor fits well into the supply-orientated growth model even for countries with a single currency and a common monetary policy implying fixed exchange rates.

In addition. the receipts from tourism contribute substantially in financing the current account deficit of the balance of payments in this country. These are convincing arguments to justify the analysis of the determinants of the demand for tourism in Portugal and might constitute an important guide-line for the policy making institutions.Empirical studies on this field for Portugal have shown little attention in modelling appropriately the demand function for tourism and identifying the main sources of tourism flows. The majority of studies take into account the demand side determinants of tourism. usually proxied by income and price measurements. and little attention has been given to the supply factors which might influence substantially the tourism performance. Factors such as infrastructures in networks and accommodation capacity in the hosting country have been ignored in such studies.

The interactions of climate change policies with the tax system become relevant in this context. This paper investigates these interactions. by analyzing the impacts. both at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. of the distinct redistribution of carbon tax revenues to the economy. To this end. numerical simulations with a hybrid computable general equilibrium model (HyBGEM) are performed. Results indicate that the whole economic impacts of a carbon tax are largely dependent on the fiscal revenue recycling mechanism chosen. A well-designed carbon tax could play a significant role in addressing the challenges posed by climate change mitigation at the least cost to the economy.

1138705,Adaptive policies for multi-mode project scheduling under uncertainty,2012,Pedro Godinho and Fernando G Branco,216,European Journal of Operational Research,3,553-562,North-Holland,In this paper we propose an adaptive model for multi-mode project scheduling under uncertainty. We assume that there is a due date for concluding the project and a tardiness penalty for failing to meet this due date. and that several distinct modes may be used to undertake each activity. We define scheduling policies based on a set of thresholds.

In this paper. we address a discrete competitive location game in which two decision-makers have to decide simultaneously where to locate their services without knowing the decisions of one another. This problem arises in a franchising environment in which the decision-makers are the franchisees and the franchiser defines the potential sites for locating services and the rules of the game. At most one service can be located at each site. and one of the franchisees has preferential rights over the other. This means that if both franchisees are interested in opening the service in the same site. only the one that has preferential rights will open it.

The results suggest that gross trade creation for the accession economies is about 25 per cent of their 2003 trade. Although membership of the EU creates trade it also results in trade diversion; that is. a declining share of accession country exports and imports with non‐EU15 countries. Overall. the trade balances of the accession countries suffer larger trade deficits after accession due to import growth surpassing export growth. The extent of increase in the trade deficit due to accession is inversely related to the level of integration and income of the new members. Hence integration is path‐dependent and the EU should take this into account when preparing for further enlargements to the Balkans and Southeast Europe.,True,UmdnuOgAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,115,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9701.2006.00834.x,3368758401083793206,/scholar?cites=3368758401083793206,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42344870/A_Gravity_Model_Forecast_of_the_Potentia20160207-3931-csou3p.pdf,0,0,0

ERPT into import prices is significant in 12 industries. whereas TRPT is significant only in six industries. with full passthrough. However.

Moreover. its geographical concentration particularly exposes certain regions of Europe to job loss as the industry declines. This book provides an explanation for the differences observed in the impact of globalization which is based on the influence of the territory and of the production specialization of the firms. The conclusions presented in the book are withdrawn from a detailed study of the Spanish textile-clothing sector. The book highlights the intensity of the relationship between the organizational model of the territory where the firms are located (high concentration of interrelated firms in a well-defined geographical area called"" industrial district""). the specialization strategy implemented and the globalization of the economy. It also suggests the need to consider those factors as interdependent determinants of firm performance. particularly given the current trend for firms to simultaneously concentrate geographically and multilocalize domestically and internationally.

The partially time-varying character of our multilateral resistance variables overcomes the bias present in earlier studies that solely rely on country or country pair fixed effects. Applying the augmented gravity equation to the process of European Union (EU) integration during the 1990s. we find robust evidence that the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) have substantially increased intra-group trade. in the case of the Czech and Slovak Republic and Slovenia at the expense of the Rest of the World (ROW).

If this hypothesis is true. there should have been strong migration creation but little migration diversion in the last 20 years. The results broadly support migration creation for the CEECs prior to their EU membership. At the same time. the evidence of diversion away from other world regions is mixed.

India initiated extensive policy reforms that included the adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime and an acceleration of trade liberalization. This paper analyzes the impact of the policy reforms on exchange rate pass-through into export prices using sectoral panel data (at the two-digit Standard International Trade Classification level) for the pre-reform (1980–90) and post-reform (1991–2001) periods. Several econometric tests revealed the existence of a structural break in pass-through into export prices around 1991. The panel results suggest that the number of industries exhibiting incomplete pass-through increased in the 1990s relative to the 1980s. reflecting a higher degree of pricing power by these firms as export prices react to exchange rate changes in more sectors. after having controlled for the effect of product shares. marginal cost variations. and a macroeconomic policy index …,True,UmdnuOgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,36,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.imfsp.9450027,6683822795849253076,/scholar?cites=6683822795849253076,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40220172/mallick.pdf,0,0,0

Export price data during the post-1991 economic reforms period is disaggregated at the two-digit industry level and using a novel methodology in the ERPT literature (cointegration for heterogeneous panels) cross-industry differences in adjustment are identified. We observe that there is clear evidence of incomplete ERPT to prices in India's export markets. after having controlled for the level of exchange rate volatility and domestic inflation as an indicator of variations in marginal cost.

Our results indicate that spatial allocation together with transport costs are important determinants of regional inflation. while macroeconomic common factors do not play an important role in this process.

This action makes fiscal sustainability easier to achieve in the long run. On the other hand. for Latvia. Poland.

Therefore. the aim of this study is to develop a new framework (VLD) to assess fiscal vulnerability. VLD represents a new methodology on the measurement of fiscal vulnerability that relies on the assumption that vulnerability can occur even during calm times. In comparison with previous methodologies that studied fiscal vulnerability around crisis and fiscal distress times. our framework investigates fiscal vulnerability near fiscal adjustments episodes. Our methodology relies on two distinct indicators: one showing the vulnerabilities indicated by the level of the cyclically adjusted budget balance and distance-to-stability. and one showing the vulnerabilities pointed out through the changes of the cyclically adjusted budget balance and public debt. VLD is able to classify fiscal vulnerability into five distinct categories having scores from 0 (no fiscal vulnerability) to 4 (extreme fiscal vulnerability). Using annual data ranging over 1990–2013 for 28 European Union countries. we evidenced 310 episodes of fiscal vulnerability. out of which 128 episodes of low vulnerability. 94 of moderate. 62 of strong. and 26 of extreme fiscal vulnerability.

1138768,A Retrospective Approach on Government Response to Increasing Public Debt: Empirical Evidence for European Countries,2011,Andreea Stoian,,,15/2011,,,Many researchers have been focused for decades on the issue of public debt considering its effect on fiscal sustainability in the long run. There is a recent body of research showing that the current financial crises will lead to a considerable increase of public debt in a number of advanced economies. Many European countries have confronted with large and increasing public debt stocks that overrated GDP. Considering that. the question on how government should address this problem arises. Theoretically speaking. governments should increase/decrease primary surplus/deficit. and the response should be immediate. The aim of this paper is to investigate government’s reaction to increasing public debt for European Union countries. Fiscal reaction function is employed on annual data spanned mostly on 1980.2012. Empirical evidence shows various results. In the case of Germany fiscal policy is pro-cyclical. but the results reveal no significant reaction of government to changes in public debt. For Belgium and Denmark the test shows a long run relationship between cyclically adjusted primary balance and public debt and error correction term indicates the existence of adjustment mechanism in the short term for assessing primary surplus. In the cases of Spain and France the response is opposite as expected and parameters point out on difficulties in achieving a cointegrated relation. For Greece and Italy test rejects any cointegration relationship and the use of fiscal rule reveals that government has difficulties in generating primary surplus.

These went to large deficits and public debt stocks. Consequently. the exposure to liquidity and/or solvency risks increased. In this context. the question of how vulnerable fiscal policy is naturally arises. The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for assessing fiscal vulnerability. The methodology bases on a simple public debt dynamic model with growing economy. increasing public debt and inflation rate that allows the estimation of a required primary balance. Comparing with the current primary balance. one can said that fiscal policy is vulnerable whenever the required primary balance is larger than the current one. The methodology is applied on annual data spanned on 1970-2012 for Belgium. Ireland. Greece. Italy. Hungary. Malta and the Netherlands. The results show that fiscal policy was vulnerable in many of the years from the period under review.

Methods Participants were 472 students from three medical schools in Portugal. They completed validated adaptations to Portuguese of self-report measures of the NEO-Five Factor Inventory(NEO-FFI) and the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy(JSPE-spv). Students were categorized into two groups: “Bottom” (low empathy. N = 165) and “Top” (high empathy. N = 169) according to their empathy JSPE-spv total score terciles. Correlation analysis. binary logistic regression analysis and ROC curve analysis were conducted.  Results A regression model with gender. age and university had a predictive power (pseudo R2) for belonging to the top or bottom group of 6.4%. The addition of personality dimensions improved the predictive power to 16.8%. Openness to experience and Agreeableness were important to predict top or bottom empathy scores when gender. age and university were considered.” Based on the considered predictors the model correctly classified 69.3% of all students.

This paper checks the extent of public confidence in the restructuring of higher education currently underway by looking at its impact on the demand for academic programs in Portugal. We concentrate on students revealed first preference when applying to higher education. Results indicate that the programs that restructured to follow the Bologna principles were subject to higher demand than comparable programs that did not restructure; that effect. however. varies across fields of study and with program size.

Economic theory suggests that the impact of exchange rates should vary with the degree of exposure to international competition and with the technology level. We show that both the degree of openness and the technology level mediate the impact of exchange rate movements on labour market developments.

First. workers who are hired last. are the first to leave the firm. Second. workers' wages rise with seniority. where seniority is defined as a worker's tenure relative to the tenure of his colleagues. Controlling for tenure. the probability of a worker leaving the firm decreases with seniority. The increase in expected seniority with tenure explains a large part of the negative duration dependence of the separation hazard.

If. as often suggested. flexibility in hours of work is a useful measure to postpone retirement. then a reduction in working hours should be associated with retirement at later ages. Results prove otherwise suggesting that reducing hours of work before retirement is associated with early exits from the labour force. A reduction in hours of work seems to signal the worker’s wish to retire sooner rather than to announce the desire of remaining in the labour market. This result may enclose the need for some alternative policy strategies regarding working hours.

First. workers who are hired last. are the first to leave the firm (Last In. First Out; LIFO). Second. workers' wages rise with seniority (= a worker's tenure relative to the tenure of her colleagues). We seek to explain these regularities by developing a dynamic model of the firm with stochastic product demand and hiring cost (= irreversible specific investments). There is wage bargaining between a worker and its firm. Separations (quits or layoffs) obey the LIFO rule and bargaining is efficient (a zero surplus at the moment of separation). The LIFO rule provides a stronger bargaining position for senior workers. leading to a return to seniority in wages. Efficiency in hiring requires the workers' bargaining power to be in line with their share in the cost of specific investment. Then. the LIFO rule is a way to protect their property right on the specific investment.

In this paper. we show that the inclusion of labour adjustment costs in a trade model affects the impact of exchange rate movements on employment. We also explore how labour market rigidities interact with the degree of exposure to international competition and with the technology level. Our model-based predictions are consistent with estimates obtained using panel data for 23 OECD countries. Namely. our estimates suggest that employment in low-technology sectors that have a very high degree of openness to trade and are located in countries with more flexible labour markets are more sensitive to exchange rate changes.

É o investimento que introduz nas organizações as instalações. os equipamentos e os processos que incorporam o avanço do conhecimento e que permitirão utilizar de forma mais produtiva os recursos disponíveis. Porém. numa economia em que o enquadramento institucional – nomeadamente no que diz respeito aos sistemas político e de justiça – torna ainda mais incerta a rendibilidade do investimento. ou distorce os incentivos à sua realiza- ção. será mais difícil. por um lado. atrair investimento e. por outro lado. que o investimento flua para as atividades com maior retorno para a sociedade.

The evidence suggest that the trend of the returns to education seems to be growing from1986 to 1995. reaching a peak in1995 and reverting after that. from 1997 to 2004 there is a slightly increasing trend again and from thereafter until the end of 2000s the rate of return to education remains practically constant and close to 10%. In addition. the trend of the returns for men and for women is opposed. since from 2000 this trend is slightly decreasing for men but for women this trend keeps increasing until 2009. reaching a return rate of 10. 3%.,True,Ukeg4DAAAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC,12,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3091530263956003462&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3091530263956003462,/scholar?cites=3091530263956003462,,,0,0,0
1138798,Returns to postgraduate education in Portugal: Holding on to a higher ground?,2017,André Almeida and Hugo Figueiredo and João Cerejeira and Miguel Portela and Carla Sá and Pedro Teixeira,,,10676,,IZA Discussion Paper,In this paper we use a large official employer-employee dataset. which includes almost the whole universe of business firms. to document and decompose the rising graduates postgraduates' wage differentials in Portugal. Using a non-parametric matching exercise. we pay particular attention to differences in the assignment of these two groups of workers across occupations and tasks. This allows us to disentangle different sources of postgraduates' relative earnings and look at the creation of postgraduate jobs. We further look. however. at displacement and deskilling effects due to relative demand inertia as possible sources of such evolution of the relative earnings. Our results show that both displacement and deskilling effects. particularly of graduates with only a first-degree. appear to be at least as important as direct productivity effects in explaining postgraduates premiums. We also conclude that the relative importance of the former has been steadily increasing overtime and that. on the contrary. the net creation of high-paying. postgraduate-only jobs has been relatively modest. This suggests that postgraduate degrees have largely worked as a way of holding on to a higher ground in the labour market.,True,Ukeg4DAAAAAJ:vDijr-p_gm4C,11,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2949112,13072734799907283531,/scholar?cites=13072734799907283531,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/49404/1/NIPE%20WP_08_2017.pdf,0,0,0

Our results show a widening of the gender wage gap following the amendment: the wage gap for minors increased 2.7 percentage points more than for other groups. This change was mainly determined by a redistribution of fringe benefits and overtime payments. We discuss three possible sources of redistribution:(i) a change in the skill composition of the working males and females after the increase in the minimum wage.(ii) industrial differences in response to the changes in the wage floor. and (iii) discrimination.

Using a particularly rich linked employer-employee dataset from Portugal. covering a large number of corporate ownership changes across a wide spectrum of economic sectors over more than 20 years. we find that rent sharing is significantly higher in firms with a larger share of private ownership. Estimates from our most preferred empirical specification suggest that an increase in the private ownership share of 10 percentage points increases (on average) the rent-sharing elasticity by 0.0002. Based on a theoretical analysis that incorporates union-firm wage bargaining and efficiency wage effects within the same modelling framework. this result cannot be explained by private firms being more profit oriented than public ones …,True,Ukeg4DAAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC,9,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12122-011-9109-6,15701725521057458892,/scholar?cites=15701725521057458892,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/36778/1/62523197X.pdf,0,0,0

However. the investment costs often constitute a major barrier to their spread use. Moreover. the overall benefits of renewable energy technologies are often not well understood and consequently they are often evaluated to be not as cost effective as traditional technologies. From the moment that the energy sector started a deregulation process. with a high level of competitiveness and associated increased market uncertainty. traditional project evaluation techniques alone became insufficient to properly deal with these additional risk and uncertainty factors. The diffusion of the renewable energy technologies is also affected by this feature.

1138807,Universities’ contributions to social innovation: towards a theoretical framework,2013,Jorge Cunha and Paul Benneworth,,,,,,There has been much interest of late in the analysis of the regional role of universities from the point of view of what is known as the universities’ third mission. which comprises those activities related to technology transfer. lifelong learning. and social (or community) engagement. In this context. the third mission of universities can be defined as a phenomenon in which universities are encouraged to realise their broader socio-economic potential through knowledge exchange and partnerships (Vorley and Nelles. 2008).  The first research in this field was primarily directed towards economic issues. around technology transfer and lifelong learning activities.  However. one dimension of universities’ third mission that remains relatively untapped by the literature is how universities’ other kinds of knowledge contributions can drive wider societal development. in particular related to processes around community engagement (Benneworth. 2013). We argue that universities possess all resources necessary to support community development processes beyond the business sphere and that the underdevelopment of the community mission appears to represent a clear lacuna in the literature. Therefore. the aim of this paper is to make a contribution to a more systematic understanding of university-community engagement and hence to bring back some balance and perspective to literatures around university social contributions more generally. To do so. we focus on one particular relevant mechanism. social innovation and propose a conceptual framework to understand how universities can contribute to processes of social innovation.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,40,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/25957,17807722585763594184,/scholar?cites=17807722585763594184,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/25957/1/EURA_2013_Conference_Paper_cunha_benneworth.pdf,0,0,0

To this end. a comprehensive database of commercial Light Water Reactors (LWR) was developed and a statistical analysis was conducted. Findings reveal a significant delay in lead-time. especially for the last generation reactors constructed from 2010s. with ¾ of the sample showing significant construction delays. This results in an escalation of capital costs rather than in a decline. Average OCC of newer reactors is 60% higher than the ones implemented in the earlier stages of the nuclear era.

The electricity sector portfolios are also guided by similar objectives. namely maximizing return and minimizing risk. As such. this paper proposes two possible MVA for the design of optimal renewable electricity production portfolios. The first approach is directed to portfolio output maximization and the second one is directed to portfolio cost optimization. The models implementation was achieved from data obtained for each quarter of an hour for a time period close to four years for the Portuguese electricity system. A set of renewable energy sources (RES) portfolios was obtained. mixing three RES technologies. namely hydro power. wind power and photovoltaic. This allowed to recognize the seasonality of the resources demonstrating that hydro power output is positively correlated with wind and that photovoltaic is negatively correlated with both hydro and wind. The results showed that for both models the less risky solutions are characterised by a mix of RES technologies. taking advantage of the diversification benefits. As for the highest return solutions. as expected those were the ones with higher risk but the portfolio composition largely depends on the assumed costs of each technology.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,18,https://130.225.53.24/index.php/sepm/article/view/562,7315879668349870868,/scholar?cites=7315879668349870868,,https://130.225.53.24/index.php/sepm/article/download/562/929,0,0,0

1138816,Determinants of the use of capital investment appraisal methods: evidence from the field,2009,Paulo Afonso and Jorge Cunha,,,,,,In this paper. it is argued that there are specific contingencies that explain why firms use and do not use specific capital investment appraisal methods; namely. the pressure of competitive environment. firm’s strategy. production technologies and firm’s age. Several studies on the impact of such variables on management systems can be found in the literature (Abernethy and Lillis. 1995; Langfield-Smith. 1997). Nevertheless. there is little empirical evidence on the factors that explain the use of capital investment appraisal methods (CIAM) by firms. A questionnaire was designed to collect empirical evidence on the use of capital investment appraisal methods in the larger 500 Portuguese non-financial companies. It is expected that. in practice. CIAM could be regarded not only as an ad hoc usage of more or less sophisticated techniques. but characterised by different levels of sophistication and completeness.

1138817,Social entrepreneurship and social innovation: are both the same?,2014,Jorge Cunha and Paul Benneworth,,,,,Universidade do Minho,In the last two decades. a renewed interest on the concepts of social innovation and social entrepreneurship has emerged. In fact. a large body of theoretical developments that occurred in the fields of innovation. territorial development. social economics. and public governance (among others). have emphasised the need to adopt new approaches to new (or emerging) problems. such as: climate change; chronic diseases; increasing inequalities in income distribution; high rates of unemployment (particularly. among young people); the impact of ageing population; and mass urbanisation and social exclusion phenomenon. This paper aims at contributing to these literature by making an attempt to distinguish both concepts: social innovation and social entrepreneurship. For that purpose. the definition of each of these concepts. their main features as well as their major differences are presented. Then. some examples of social innovations are briefly described in order to illustrate that social innovation is a broader concept than social entrepreneurship.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,9,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/36913,8592971174951695669,/scholar?cites=8592971174951695669,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/36913/1/PAPER_ICOPEV2014_cunha_benneworth.pdf,0,0,0
1138818,A conceptual framework to understand student volunteerism,2019,Jorge Cunha and Rainer Mensing and Paul Benneworth,25,Tertiary education and management,1,31-44,Springer Netherlands,This paper develops a conceptual framework to understand the value of an increasing number of university study programmes that send students to the global south to learn through volunteering. We ask what determines the benefit that these activities bring to the host community. To understand this. we conceptualise these activities as student volunteerism and propose a framework to understand the value of these activities based on a previously developed framework for volunteer tourism. We examine a single case study of a minor programme in a Dutch university. exploring how course design and student selection affect student behaviour as an antecedent step to creating student benefits. We identify six kinds of factors that appear to promote ‘deeper’ (better) contributions and argue that these six factors require further analysis to better realise university contributions to societal development in Global …,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:ML0RJ9NH7IQC,6,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11233-018-09012-x,8778113934612788203,/scholar?cites=8778113934612788203,,,0,0,0

1138820,An optimization approach to select portfolios of electricity generation projects with renewable energies,2015,Eduardo Matos and M Teresa T Monteiro and Paula Varandas Ferreira and Jorge Cunha and Raquel Garca-Rubio,,,,,Natural Sciences Publishing,The traditional approach to electricity planning has been the least cost methodology. which focus on finding the stand-alone cost of each technology in order to minimize power system cost. However. the increasing liberalization path of electricity markets as well as the growing inclusion of renewable energy sources in the power generation mix increased the complexity of the power system planning. To overcome these difficulties an alternative methodology has been proposed in the literature: the mean-variance approach. which has the advantage of explicitly taking into account risk measures as well as the potential correlation between technologies and fuels in power system planning. In this work seven technologies for electricity generation are considered to study the Portuguese case in 2009-2011. Five from these seven technologies are renewable ones. A multiobjective optimization approach is used to identify the optimal solutions. considering two conflicting objectives - risk and return. The computational results are obtained using the routine fgoalattain from the MATLAB optimization toolbox.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,5,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/53360,14027309567590609722,/scholar?cites=14027309567590609722,,,0,0,0
1138821,On the use of MPT to derive optimal RES electricity generation mixes,2012,Paula Varandas Ferreira and Jorge Cunha,,,,,,The use of modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a common practice to derive efficient frontiers and support portfolio decision making in financial markets. Although real projects present different characteristics and technical restrictions. the general objective of the decision maker is the same: to maximize the expected return minimizing the portfolio risk. Long term electricity generation decision making is characterized by high uncertainty. high impact on social welfare and a large set of diversified technologies that may be included in future scenarios. The possibility of applying MPT approach to define efficient electricity generation portfolios is explored in this paper focusing on particular in renewable energy sources (RES technologies). The use of MPT for building RES scenarios is demonstrated for the particular case of Portugal. One year hourly data concerning power output from wind. hydro and solar plants along with the power demand was collected and included in the analysis. Three different approaches were considered for designing the efficient frontiers aiming at maximizing the RES electricity generation. minimizing deviation between the demand and the RES production and minimizing the levelised cost of the RES system. The results demonstrate how this approach can be an effective tool to support decision making but put also in evidence the need to build modified MPT models in order to take into account the technical restrictions of the system.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,5,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/21676,6236975978528297567,/scholar?cites=6236975978528297567,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/21676/1/ESES_ecos2012_459.pdf,0,0,0

A Portuguese Higher Education Institution - the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança (in Portuguese. IPB) - was used for that purpose as a case study. The IPB is located in the region of Bragança. an isolated and deprived region in the Northeast of Portugal. Two approaches were followed: the demand-side approach (Caffrey & Isaacs. 1971) determines the economic impact arising from the expenditures of the IPB and its individuals; and the supply-side approach (Becker. 1993; Bluestone. 1993) measuring the creation of human capital and the enhancement in the quality of life of local individuals. Data collection included surveys on the faculty. staff. students and graduates of the IPB; IPB’s records. and other official sources. Following these two approaches. the IPB’s total impact upon the region was determined. reaching 55 and 61 million euros. respectively. The stakeholders related to the higher education institution were also taken into account. It was perceived that all stakeholders understood the importance of the institution to the region. and they were all engaged in helping to promote the region and the HEI’s activities.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,4,http://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/handle/10198/10244,12099401164737124169,/scholar?cites=12099401164737124169,,https://bibliotecadigital.ipb.pt/bitstream/10198/10244/1/capitulo%20livro_IPS306.pdf,0,0,0
1138823,Real options theory in comparision to other project evaluation techniques,2011,Bartolomeu Fernandes and Jorge Cunha and Paula Varandas Ferreira,,,,,Universidade do Minho,Wrong investment decisions today can lead to situations in the future that will be unsustainable and lead eventually to the bankruptcy of enterprises. Therefore. good financial management combined with good capital investment decision-making are critical to survival and long-term success of the firms. Traditionally. the net present value (NPV) and discounted cash flow (DCF) methods are worldwide used to evaluate project investments. These techniques have been classified in two major groups: sophisticated and non-sophisticated. In the former group. techniques like the DCF methods (e.g. NPV and IRR) can be found. In the latter group. techniques like the Payback Period and the Accounting Rate of Return have been included. However given that. today investments are characterized by high risks and uncertainty. DCF methodologies are inadequate to deal with these issues. Some authors argue that only the techniques that can appropriately address the problem of uncertainty (like the Real Options theory) should be applied. In this paper. the major differences between DCF methods and Real Options (RO) theory will be analyzed. Using an example. the advantages of the RO theory. compared with other methods. such as the DCF methods. in the search of better decisions will be shown. This work is expected to contribute to an increase of application of the RO Theory. by showing this technique potential.,True,K7Z1NIcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,4,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/15567,1817252250837155225,/scholar?cites=1817252250837155225,,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/15567/1/fernandes_cunha_ferreira_ICOPEV2011.pdf,0,0,0

We employ a dynamic panel model using the Arellano–Bond's Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM). Our findings suggest that a 1% increase in business R&D intensity boosts economic growth by 0.050 (0.213) % in these countries in the short (long) run. Public R&D is found to be statistically insignificant. When introducing human capital in the regression. the contribution of business R&D to economic growth decreases. although it remains significant.

Our results indicate that FDI leads to a phenomenon of creative destruction. The introduction of labor saving techniques leads to an initial negative effect on employment. while the progressive vertical integration of foreign affiliates into the local economy eventually converges toward a positive long run effect. However. this phenomenon is only observed in EU countries. Our analysis thus gives partial support to the worries that FDI may displace jobs. Still. the relative importance of FDI as a determinant of employment is modest compared to economic restructuring and output growth.

We test several cross-section spatial models. controlling for the beta–convergence and we estimate the relationship for the 247 NUTS2 European regions and separately for 189 UE15 regions and 56 CEE regions. We control for spatial autocorrelation by employing either a spatial error model (SEM) or spatial lag model (SLM). When both beta-convergence and spatial dependence is accounted for. the relationship between RCI and growth becomes highly significant. When separate models are estimated for CEE and EU15. no relation is found in the case of EU15 regions. In the case of CEE regions. RCI is significant for growth (at a 10% level). when a beta-convergence model with spatial lag is considered.

Monica Ioana POP SILAGHI** bstract: This paper examines whether accruals anomaly is related to cross-country factors of the developed stock markets. The paper finds that the extensive use of an accrual accounting system or accounting standards with a spread ownership concentration may impact negatively the accruals anomaly in various countries. The cross-sectional regression reveals that the legal system has no influence in the occurrence of accruals anomaly. Moreover. accruals anomaly is positively affected by the tax regulations. Overall. our results suggest that cross-country differences in the accounting and institutional systems allow for accruals anomaly with prevalence in some countries.,True,NV2B2RIAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,4,https://revecon.ro/articles/2014-2/2014-2-8.pdf,13428480051288124480,/scholar?cites=13428480051288124480,,https://revecon.ro/articles/2014-2/2014-2-8.pdf,0,0,0

We employed cointegration and Granger-causality tests on stochastic systems composed of exports. imports and GDP. In order to have some degree of significance. we performed our tests on quarterly data. We found that exports do not Granger-cause GDP in the Romania’s case. while the inverse relationship holds. The presence of imports in the stochastic models does not affect significantly the results. For validating our results. we performed the same tests on the 10 countries that entered EU on 1 May 2005.

1138863,The smart grid and distributed generation nexus,2017,Guillermo Pereira and Patrícia Pereira Silva,,,,,Publit,The transition towards a more decentralised electricity system. in which distributed generation is integrated at the distribution level. challenges the traditional electricity infrastructure value chain. The deployment of smart grids has been proposed as a pathway for successfully integrating and managing these variable distributed energy sources. This chapter explores the reinforcing relationship between smart grids and distributed generation. We provide key concepts of both smart grids and distributed generation. Furthermore. technical. regulatory. and economic challenges are described. Future development trajectories. investments. and research and innovation plans are discussed in the wider context of the energy transition in the united states and the european union. as a result. this chapter emphasizes how smart grids and distributed generation can contribute to a future electricity sector that is more integrated. cost-effective. and cleaner. supporting the diffusion of distributed generation visà-vis the electricity system infrastructure and vice-versa. can facilitate an energy transition that prepares society for future needs. while ensuring that present costs and quality of service are not disproportionally compromised.,True,wyBvcjMAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Zapata12/publication/323784165_Assessing_the_effect_of_the_diffusion_of_solar_PV_in_the_Colombian_and_Brazilian_residential_sector/links/5aaad4c8a6fdccd3b9bbf287/Assessing-the-effect-of-the-diffusion-of-solar-PV-in-the-Colombian-and-Brazilian-residential-sector.pdf#page=13,5356664604763026422,/scholar?cites=5356664604763026422,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastian_Zapata12/publication/323784165_Assessing_the_effect_of_the_diffusion_of_solar_PV_in_the_Colombian_and_Brazilian_residential_sector/links/5aaad4c8a6fdccd3b9bbf287/Assessing-the-effect-of-the-diffusion-of-solar-PV-in-the-Colombian-and-Brazilian-residential-sector.pdf#page=13,0,0,0

This uncertainty is due to the rapid emergence of new service possibilities enabled by new information and communication technologies for electricity management and new distributed energy resources. This research addresses the observed uncertainty through a foresight study in which policy alternatives were evaluated in terms of business model innovation. technological adaptation. and market design issues. For this purpose. 208 experts evaluated 57 policy alternatives. following a Policy Delphi method. The study results indicate the importance of adapting the current business model and the need to simultaneously develop regulatory frameworks that support innovation.

The existing 20% energy efficiency target for 2020. recently reinforced for 2030 towards a 27% energy consumption reduction goal creates a higher pressure to deliver the potential benefits for the economy. environment and society. This research paper presents a governance analysis. as a proxy on the ability of Member States to contribute to the existing energy efficiency targets. The governance analysis conducted for the EU-28 highlights that more efforts are required to ensure that Member States follow and adopt existing legislation. alongside with developments on the existing financial support mechanisms. human capacities and institutional structures.

They are fun to drive. winning rave reviews from many drivers. The climate change benefits of electric vehicles are especially critical. Concentrations of heat-trapping gases are now higher than at any time since humans started walking the Earth—and climbing. We are already seeing the impacts. including more severe and frequent storms. floods. droughts and heat waves. More than 180 nations have now ratified the Paris Agreement. agreeing to work together to address this challenge and achieve net-zero emission globally by the second half of this century. That will require significant transformation in the transport sector with low carbon technologies such as electric drive trains. Electric vehicles are a small part of the global vehicle fleet but growing rapidly. Growth is especially strong in China. where drivers bought more electric vehicles last year than in the rest of the world combined. Growth is also significant in the United States. Japan and much of western Europe. In 2018 more than half of new cars sold in Norway had electric drive trains. These countries have many differences. Can they learn from each other with respect to electric vehicle deployment? We believe the answer is yes. This volume focuses in particular on urban policies. The authors find that. despite differences in size. political organization and other factors. the five cities in three countries studied face similar challenges with respect to deployment of electric vehicle infrastructure.

1138871,Assessment of policy. technology. and business model adaptation for smart and sustainable electricity distribution,2019,Guillermo Ivan de Loureiro Pereira,,,,,,The growing diffusion of distributed energy resources including renewable energy generation. electric mobility. and electricity storage. in combination with the deployment of smart grids. and a more active role of consumers are reshaping the electricity sector infrastructure and utilities’ business models. This is particularly challenging for electricity distribution utilities – Distribution System Operators (DSOs). in the European Union (EU) context. which operate at the interface of downstream connected consumers and distributed energy resources. and upstream large-scale electricity generation and transmission. therefore having a critical role in enabling adaptation and innovation across the supply chain. This thesis focuses on studying the changing role of DSOs and aims to contribute to a more detailed understanding of policy. technology. and business model adaptation towards smart and sustainable electricity distribution. This is delivered through three policy-oriented empirical assessments. Firstly. a foresight analysis implemented through a Policy Delphi expert elicitation technique is presented. evaluating future alternatives to inform business model innovation. technological adaptation. and market design options. Secondly. a case study approach is unveiled highlighting the DSO’s challenges and opportunities at present. Lastly. a capabilities assessment. applied through a Structural Equations Model (SEM). explores the ability of DSOs to implement business model innovations and adaptation in a rapidly changing electricity sector. These assessments build on novel primary data collected from over 200 electricity sector stakeholders. including …,True,wyBvcjMAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,0,https://eg.uc.pt/handle/10316/87534,,,,,0,0,0

The first four sub-indicators are “opportunity” indicators that take into account administrative. education and health outcomes and the quality of public infrastructure and that support the rule of law and a level playing-field in a market economy. Three other indicators reflect the standard “Musgravian” tasks for government: allocation. distribution and stabilisation. The input and output efficiency of public sectors across countries is then measured via a non-parametric production frontier technique. The study finds significant differences in PSP and PSE. which suggests a large potential for expenditure savings in many countries.,True,FlcHP7AAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1249,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-005-7165-2,11929085015187556449,/scholar?cites=11929085015187556449,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/152676/1/ecbwp0242.pdf,0,0,0

After a conceptual discussion of expenditure efficiency measurement. we compute efficiency scores and rankings by applying a range of measurement techniques. The study finds that expenditure efficiency across new EU member states is rather diverse especially as compared to the group of top performing emerging markets in Asia.

Those are two areas where public expenditure is of great importance so that findings have strong implications in what concerns public sector efficiency. When estimating the efficiency frontier we focus on measures of quantity inputs. We believe this approach to be advantageous since a country may well be efficient from a technical point of view but appear as inefficient if the inputs it uses are expensive. Efficient outcomes across sectors and analytical methods seem to cluster around a small number of core countries. even if for different reasons: Japan.
