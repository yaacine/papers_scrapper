In this work. we innovatively developed CoSO4-based Ag nanofluid which might be utilized as fluid optical filter for hybrid PV/T system with silicon concentrator (CPV) solar cell. Firstly. highly dispersed Ag/CoSO4 nanofluids with various concentrations were prepared. The results from the measured optical transmittance of the prepared nanofluids show that Ag/CoSO4 nanofluid has a strong absorption over a broader spectrum than that of water-based one. Subsequently. the effect of Ag nanofluids filters on the electrical performance of the silicon CPV cell was discussed. Ag/CoSO4 nanofluids produce lower short circuit current and thus lower electrical output than Ag/water nanofluids at the same mass fraction of Ag nanoparticles. whereas they yield higher stagnation temperature than Ag/water nanofluids …,True,VS2L9UoAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X1831137X,10256442025946015243,/scholar?cites=10256442025946015243,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinyue_Han2/publication/330055903_Investigation_of_CoSO4-based_Ag_nanofluids_as_spectral_beam_splitters_for_hybrid_PVT_applications/links/5f0d13ee4585155a552813d5/Investigation-of-CoSO4-based-Ag-nanofluids-as-spectral-beam-splitters-for-hybrid-PV-T-applications.pdf,0,0,0

Energy resources are becoming more scarce and expensive. Most of the currently used refrigerants have brought an international concern about global warming. The search for more efficient cooling/refrigeration systems with environmental friendly refrigerants has become more and more important so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ensure sustainable and affordable energy systems. The most widely used air-conditioning and refrigeration system. based on the vapor compression cycle. is driven by converting electricity into mechanical work which is a high quality type of energy. However. these systems can instead be possibly driven by heat. be made solid-state (ie. thermoelectric cooling). consist entirely of a gaseous working fluid (ie. reverse Brayton cycle). etc. This research explores several thermally driven cooling systems in order to understand and further overcome some of the major drawbacks associated with their performance as well as their high capital costs.

1330514,Experimental and Numerical Studies on the Soot Formation of Liquid Fuel Relevant Compounds,2018,Tongfeng Zhang,,,,,,In the present thesis. fundamental experimental and numerical studies are performed for the soot formation of liquid fuel relevant compounds. The thesis is composed of four research studies. The first develops an improved data analysis approach for the combined laser extinction and two-angle elastic light scattering diagnostics to relate the various measured optical cross sections to soot aggregate properties. Compared to previously reported studies. the proposed approach can be applied to a wider range of soot sources by removing the assumption made to scattering regime or moment ratio of aggregate size distribution. The second study investigates the effects of n-propylbenzene addition to n-dodecane on soot formation and aggregate structure in a laminar coflow diffusion flame using the combined laser extinction and two-angle elastic light scattering method. It is shown that the relative importance of soot inception and surface growth affected by n-propylbenzene addition is different along the flame wing and centerline. with the aromatic fuel chemistry effect being stronger along the centerline. The third study extends the investigation on the same issue using a numerical model. The simulation results show that mixing n-propylbenzene into the liquid fuel mixture accelerates soot inception. and increases soot surface growth per unit surface area by PAH addition. while soot surface growth per unit surface area by HACA is shown to decrease modestly with n-propylbenzene addition.

1330545,A house in the sun: Modern architecture and solar energy in the Cold War,2016,Daniel A Barber,,,,,Oxford university press,A House in the Sun describes a number of experiments in solar house heating in American architectural. engineering. political. economic. and corporate contexts from the beginning of World War II until the late 1950s. Houses were built across the Midwest. Northeast. and Southwestern United States. and also proposed for sites in India. South Africa. and Morocco. These experiments developed in parallel to transformations in the discussion of modern architecture. relying on new materials and design ideas for both energy efficiency and claims to cultural relevance. Architects were among the myriad cultural and scientific actors to see the solar house as an important designed element of the American future. These experiments also developed as part of a wider analysis of the globe as an interconnected geophysical system. Perceived resource limitations in the immediate postwar period led to new understandings of the relationship between energy. technology and economy. The solar house-both as a charged object in the milieu of suburban expansion. and as a means to raise the standard of living in developing economies-became an important site for social. technological. and design experimentation. This led to new forms of expertise in architecture and other professions. Daniel Barber argues that this mid-century interest in solar energy was one of the first episodes in which resource limitations were seen as an opportunity for design to attain new relevance for potential social and cultural transformations.

1330554,Modern Architecture and Climate: Design Before Air Conditioning,2020,Daniel A Barber,,,,,Princeton University Press,How climate influenced the design strategies of modernist architects Modern Architecture and Climate explores how leading architects of the twentieth century incorporated climate-mediating strategies into their designs. and shows how regional approaches to climate adaptability were essential to the development of modern architecture. Focusing on the period surrounding World War II—before fossil-fuel powered air-conditioning became widely available—Daniel Barber brings to light a vibrant and dynamic architectural discussion involving design. materials. and shading systems as means of interior climate control. He looks at projects by well-known architects such as Richard Neutra. Le Corbusier. Lúcio Costa. Mies van der Rohe. and Skidmore. Owings. and Merrill. and the work of climate-focused architects such as MMM Roberto. Olgyay and Olgyay. and Cliff May. Drawing on the editorial projects of James Marston Fitch. Elizabeth Gordon. and others. he demonstrates how images and diagrams produced by architects helped conceptualize climate knowledge. alongside the work of meteorologists. physicists. engineers. and social scientists. Barber describes how this novel type of environmental media catalyzed new ways of thinking about climate and architectural design. Extensively illustrated with archival material.

Transport models of a pre-conceptual 236 MWt pebble-bed fluoride-salt-cooled. high-temperature reactor (PB-FHR) estimate that the production of tritium is relatively low resulting in partial pressures ranging between 0 and 20 Pa.

The generation mechanism. distribution. reduction route. and release type of tritium (H-3) in HTR-PM are presented with a complete theoretical model. The calculation results indicate the majority of H-3 in the core is generated by the activation reaction of B-10. The activity concentration of H-3 in the primary loop and the specific activity of H-3 in the secondary loop at the operating equilibrium are computed as 3.69 × 106  of helium and 4.22 × 104 Bq/kg of water. respectively.

The primary coolant salt is known as flibe (7Li2BeF4). which was chosen for its desirable thermal-hydraulic and neutronic properties. Under irradiation. coolant salts containing lithium capture neutrons generating tritium in quantities that are several orders of magnitude larger than the amounts generated by existing light water reactors. Adsorption technology is proposed. using chemically compatible carbon materials for the capture and control of tritium in the FHR. Various nanoporous activated carbon. graphene and nuclear graphite materials have been characterized. This includes the determination of BET surface area. total pore volume. average pore size. and pore size distribution by performing low-temperature gas adsorption experiments and applying microscopic thermodynamic theory. In addition. morphological analysis was conducted with scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogen was used as a surrogate. Its chemisorption on these materials have been measured and modeled at the reactor conditions of 700°C and pressures under 4 kPa. Models suggest that the total measured solubility of hydrogen includes a combination of dissociative and molecular adsorption.

B,5B,487,David Publishing Company. Inc.,Insight into the different values of water is essential to support rational decision making about policies. management and investments in the water sector. The main objective of this paper is to estimate an economic value of irrigation water in Jordan by choosing appropriate methodology fit with available data. The Residual Imputation Method (RIM) is used to determine the average economic value of irrigation water used in agriculture across crops. The results showed that the weighted average of water value used in field crops is JD 0.44 m-3 and JD 1.23 m-3 for vegetable crops and JD 0.23 m-3 for fruit trees. The overall weighted average water value in irrigation is estimated with JD 0.51 m-3. With regard to individual crops. cucumbers had the highest water values with about JD 6.05 m-3. followed by string beans with JD 2.64 m-3. and sweet pepper with JD 2.54 m-3. The lowest returns per m³ were provided by squash. radish and hot pepper. For fruit tress banana has the highest water value JD 0.79 m-3 and olive tress has the lowest with only JD 0.069 m-3. The current practice of some banana producers is economically rational by installing Reverse Osmosis unit to irrigate banana. since water value is twice the desalination costs of one cubic meter. The estimated values represent the maximum price that farmers might be willing to pay for water under the current market conditions. Water subsidy distorts farmers’ perception of water as a scarce and thus valuable resource. Low water prices are thus likely to engender excessive use.

The water demand of the domestic sector is the first sector to be fulfilled according to Jordan’s water strategies and policies. However. many of the Jordanian residents are undervaluing the value of water. The Domestic water is provided by the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) at low prices for most residents in comparison to the actual cost of supply. This situation accompanied with the modest improvement of the operation and service performance leaded to large deficit in investing in the water system infrastructure to maintain and expand it. Additionally. many residents are paying higher cost for water sources other than the public water provided by WAJ due to the need for better water quality and additional water quantities.The objective of this paper is to estimate the value of water used for domestic purpose as a way to assist in setting the appropriate water tariff and through recognizing the actual economic value of water. Estimating the economic value of domestic water is a complex process since using water for domestic water does not contribute directly to an economic production while most of its value comes from the extrinsic values. The value to users of water is a key component of the extrinsic values that can be measured using the willingness to pay approach which could be expressed by the cost of water on users. Data availability is a key factor considered in determining the appropriate approach for valuing water. This factor leaded to apply the opportunity cost approach.

1330595,Drying of oil palm frond via swirling fluidization technique,2011,Mohd Faizal Mohideen and Mohd Faiz and Hamidon Salleh and Hanis Zakaria and Vijay R Raghavan,3,Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering,2011,2375-2380,,Oil palm frond (OPF) is one of the largest available resources of biomass from oil palm plantations. Previous research works reported the high potentials of using the OPF as the main component for cattle feed. The production of cattle feed however. depends strongly on the drying efficiency of freshly pruned OPF. The current study proposes the swirling fluidization technique as a method for drying the OPF. A laboratory scale swirling fluidized bed dryer (SFBD) was constructed to carry out investigation on hydrodynamics and drying characteristics of chopped OPF in hot air stream at temperatures of 45ºC and 60ºC. OPF which consists of leaves (57% moisture content–wet basis) and stem (70% moisture content–wet basis) are dried separately in the SFBD. The average time taken to reduce moisture to 15%(as per required in cattle feed production) is about 60 minutes for leaves and 90 minutes for stems. It was found that the hydrodynamics and drying kinetics of both leaves and stems differ greatly. The leaves dry faster with large amount of moisture loss in early stages of drying before slowing down. in contrast with stems. This leads to a conclusion that the leaves are kinetic controlled while the stems are diffusion controlled and thus justifies the drying to be conducted separately. In conclusion. drying of OPF using swirling fluidized bed is effective for both continuous and batch drying. The ability to fluidize the highly irregular shapes of OPF at relatively low energy consumption is another strong advantage to use the swirling fluidization technique in comparison with other methods of fluidized bed drying as reported in the literature.,True,_LBdb64AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,26,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohd-Faizal-Mohideen-Batcha/publication/289589370_Drying_of_Oil_Palm_Frond_via_Swirling_Fluidization_Technique/links/57be55d208aeb95224d07c19/Drying-of-Oil-Palm-Frond-via-Swirling-Fluidization-Technique.pdf,10235558185157907261,/scholar?cites=10235558185157907261,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohd-Faizal-Mohideen-Batcha/publication/289589370_Drying_of_Oil_Palm_Frond_via_Swirling_Fluidization_Technique/links/57be55d208aeb95224d07c19/Drying-of-Oil-Palm-Frond-via-Swirling-Fluidization-Technique.pdf,0,0,0

The dry process which uses abrasive media blasted onto a surface to clean dirt on the surface normally will release fine dust into the environment. Water is used with abrasive media to reduce the dust release into the environment and named as wet abrasive blasting process. However. water causes corrosion to metal surface. In this study. analysis of RBD palm olein as an alternative to the use of water in wet abrasive blasting process was investigated. The analysis in this study covers performance of cleaning process. personal dust exposure reduction. emission rate reduction and corrosion inhibition. In this research. the performance of RBD palm olein abrasive blasting was evaluated using ISO 8501-1 visual assessment method. Abrasive blasting workers’ exposure level to the dust release from abrasive blasting activity was determined using NIOSH Method 0500 dan 0600.

In this context. to perform the mixing process should have two different fluids that also have different properties which will combines it in a single equipment to make an another fluid. The main objective of this research study is to propose a new approach of fractal concept (circle grid perforated plate) for internal rapid mixing by determining the coefficient of variation (COV). This study was implemented by fully numerical simulations. The simulations of mixing fluid were carried out with the help of commercial computational fluid dynamic (CFD) package ANSYS CFX 14.0 sohare. The simulation was done primarily in cylindrical pipe with insertions of circle grid perforated plate with porosity of 50% and 75%. Three levels of laminar flow have been chosen to result in Reynolds numbers (Re) equal to 100. 200 and 400. The effectiveness of circle grid perforated plate static mixer has been evaluated by comparing the homogeneity level of mixing fluids to the Kenics static mixer that readily available in industries applications. Based on the research findings. the COV value of circle grid perforated plate with 75% porosity at Reynolds number 400 is 0.00427 which is almost completely mixed for mixing fluid and the pressure drop value is 6.02 1Wa. In term of manufacturing cost and energy loss due to static mixer. definitely this new approach of 75% porosity circle grid perforated plate is better design compared to the Kenics static mixer because of lower number of inserts and simpler design of static mixer to produce.,True,_LBdb64AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6338460370069049126&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42955267.pdf,0,0,0

1330642,Oil flow from compressor valve to discharge tube,2016,Jiu Xu,,,,,,Oil existence is important for compressor operation because it provides lubrication. cooling and sealing. But the discharge process of the compressor inevitably entrains some oil in the refrigerant vapor. which makes oil leave compressor and circulate in the system. For better heat transfer and refrigerant distribution. it is preferable to reduce the mass flow rate of oil in system circulation.  Visualization of closing and opening of the compressor discharge valve shows the how oil enters into the compressor plenum. High speed videos are taken to look at the valve and the discharge tube in order to get the oil droplet size and velocity. Due to the difficulty of flow visualization in the plenum space. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to simulate the oil flow from the valve to the discharge. Discrete phase model in CFD can calculate the oil droplet trajectory in a certain fluid field of refrigerant vapor. To validate the CFD simulation. size distribution from video processing at the valve is used as the input of the calculation and the calculation results are compared to size distribution in the discharge tube. Potential oil separation structure design inside the compressor plenum is also compared based on the simulation. Compressors produce annular-mist flow consisting of refrigerant vapor flow with oil film and oil droplets in the discharge tube.

Rosalam,23,Journal of Applied Science and Technology,1,,Penerbit UTM Press,This work reports the effect of the membrane pore size distribution on the oil droplets size distribution in permeate using the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. The sponge-like structures of the PVDF membranes were fabricated via the phase inversion technique using 30% v/v ethanol aqueous solution as coagulation medium. Water and polyethylene glycol (PEG1000) were used as the pore forming additives in the dope solutions. Microfiltration was employed to coalesce the oil droplets at the transmembrane pressure of 2.5 bar. Simulated alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) produced water was tested as the feed solution. Results revealed that the PVDF membranes with sponge-like structure were formed. The additives in the dope solutions have induced the membranes to become thicker due to more porous. spongy and resilient structure. The membrane pore sizes increased with the presence of the additives in the dope solutions especially when larger molecular weight of the additive. ie. PEG1000 was used.

1330726,The joint effect of centralised cogeneration plants and thermal storage on the efficiency and cost of the power system,2018,Juan Pablo Jiménez Navarro and Konstantinos C Kavvadias and Sylvain Quoilin and Andreas Zucker,149,Energy,,535-549,Pergamon,The coupling of the heating and the electricity sectors is of utmost importance when it comes to the achievement of the decarbonisation and the energy efficiency targets set for the 2020 and 2030 in the EU. Centralised cogeneration plants connected to district heat networks are fundamental element of this coupling.Despite the efficiency benefits. the effects of introducing combined generation to the power system are sometimes adverse. Reduced flexibility caused by contractual obligations to deliver heat may not always facilitate the penetration of renewable energy in the energy system. Thermal storage is acknowledged as a solution to the above.This work investigates the optimal operation of cogeneration plants combined with thermal storage. To do so. a combined heat and power (CHP) plant model is formulated and incorporated into Dispa-SET. a JRC in-house unit commitment and dispatch model.

Cross-sectoral linkages are already recognized as a cost-effective decarbonisation strategy that provides significant flexibility to the system. Modelling such cross-sectoral interconnections is thus highly relevant. In this work. these interactions are considered in a long-term perspective by uni-directional soft-linking of two models: JRC-EU-TIMES. a long term planning multisectoral model. and Dispa-SET. a unit commitment and optimal dispatch model covering multiple energy sectors such as power. heating & cooling. transportation etc. The impact of sector coupling in future Europe-wide energy systems with high shares of renewables is evaluated through five scenarios.

The possibility to increase the flexibility provided to the heat network through specific building design is investigated. The role of different parts of the building structure on thermal flexibility is assessed through a parameter variation on a building model. Different building designs are subjected to heat cutoffs. and flexibility is evaluated with respect to comfort preservation and heating power peak creation.Under the conditions of this study. the thermal transmittance of the envelope appears to have the largest impact on thermal flexibility. The importance of window design. namely the size. U-value and orientation. is underlined due to its critical influence on solar gains and heat losses.

1330767,Identification of parameters affecting the variability of energy use in residential buildings,2016,Panagiota Gianniou and Alfred Heller and Per Sieverts Nielsen and Carsten Rode,,"Proceedings of CLIMA Conference, Aalborg",,,,Energy use of buildings varies significantly. When aggregating the demand profiles of a group of buildings. the variations of energy demand are critical to determine the aggregated load profile. Especially when dimensioning district energy systems. it is important to know the variability of energy demand that can guarantee the efficient operation of the system. For this reason. it is useful to distinguish the parameters that affect building energy performance the most and to estimate the magnitude of these variations on each parameter. The aim of the present study is to identify the parameters that lead to the largest variations in energy performance of residential buildings in Denmark. A set of sensitivity analysis has been carried out using an extensive search algorithm. These sensitivity analyses were then applied for modelling a reference building representing Danish single-family houses of the 1940’s. The study was able to determine the key variables that affect energy use in old Danish single-family houses using sensitivity analysis and proposes a methodology for parameter optimization. This analysis pointed out that the insulation in external walls and roof lead to the largest variations in space heating demand. Also. the infiltration rate and occupancy behavior play important role on space heating consumption. It was concluded that these findings highly depend on the specific case study and the characteristics of the buildings that are examined.

EPFL,Nowadays. the minimization of energy consumption and the optimization of efficiency of the overall energy grid have been in the agenda of most national and international energy policies. At the same time. urbanization has put cities under the microscope towards achieving costeffective energy savings due to their compact and highly dense form. Thus. accurate estimation of energy demand of cities is of high importance to policy-makers and energy planners. This calls for automated methods that can be easily expandable to higher levels of aggregation. ranging from clusters of buildings to neighbourhoods and cities. Buildings occupy a key place in the development of smart cities as they represent an important potential to integrate smart energy solutions. Building energy consumption affects significantly the performance of the entire energy network. Therefore. a realistic estimation of the aggregated building energy use will not only ensure security of supply but also enhance the stabilization of national energy balances.In this study. the aggregation of building energy demand was investigated for a real case in Sønderborg. Denmark. Sixteen single-family houses-mainly built in the 1960s-were examined. all connected to the regional district heating network.

With the purpose to determine the performance of a device on a lab scale. but with commercial features. a flat plate solar collector with phase change material (PCM) containers under the absorber plate was constructed and tested. PCM used was a commercial semi-refined light paraffin with a melting point of 60 C. Tests were carried out in outdoor conditions from October 2016 to March 2017 starting at 7: 00 AM until the collector does not transfer heat to the water after sunset. Performance variables as water inlet temperature. outlet temperature. mass flow and solar radiation were measured in order to determine a useful heat and the collector efficiency. Furthermore. operating temperatures of the glass cover. air gap. absorber plate. and PCM containers are presented. Other external variables as ambient temperature. humidity and wind speed were measured with a weather station located next to the collector. The developed prototype reached an average thermal efficiency of 24.11% and a maximum outlet temperature of 50 C. Results indicate that the absorber plate reached the PCM melting point in few cases. this suggests that the use of a PCM with a lower melting point could be a potential strategy to increase thermal storage.

Likewise. the validity of representing processes through numerical simulations will depend on the accuracy of the thermal properties of the materials. The most relevant properties in the characterization of phase change materials (PCM) are the phase change enthalpy. thermal conductivity. heat capacity and density. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is the most widely used technique for determining thermophysical properties. However. several unconventional methods have been proposed in the literature. mainly due to overcome the limitations of DSC. namely. the small sample required which is unsuitable for studying inhomogeneous materials. This paper presents the characterization of two commercial paraffins commonly used in TES applications. using methods such as T-history and T-melting. which were selected due to their simplicity. high reproducibility. and low cost of implementation. In order to evaluate the reliability of the methods. values calculated with the proposed alternative methods are compared with the results obtained by DSC measurements and with the manufacturer’s technical datasheet. Results obtained show that these non-conventional techniques can be used for the accurate estimation of selected thermal properties.

Geological Society of Australia Special Publication,,71-84,,In the southern Eromanga Basin the Murta Member of the Mooga Formation comprises a mainly fine-grained lacustrine sequence intervening between braided-fluvial sediments of the Namur Sandstone Member and the overlying. marginal marine ‘Transition beds'. The sequence intertongues with the Namur Sandstone Member on a regional scale and the upper contact with the ‘Transition beds' is gradational. Regional reduction in thickness and sand content from the north-northeast to the southwest reflects a depositional pattern whereby the'Namur'braided fluvial regime contributed large volumes of sediment to the'Murta'lake on the northern and eastern lake margins. The Jackson Field oil discovery occurs in this area and sandy proximal delta and sub-lacustrine fan sequences have been cored there. The sequence prograded towards the south-southwest and fine-grained sediment and occasional coarse-grained sands were transported large distances into the lake by density flows (ie turbidity currents). The Dullingari Field. which is a structural-stratigraphic trap. occurs in this setting.

Late Carboniferous to Early Permian glacigene sedimentation in the basin gave way in the Sa marian to carbonate shelf sedimentation. after the melting of a glacier system. Early Artins ian uplift and erosion along the basin margin was followed by progradation of a sand-rich. wave-dominated delta system. Comp• action. subsidence and a deterioration of wave energy permitted a transition to a mud-rich. river-dominated. lobate delta with marginal tide influence. Complete marine inundation in the mid• Artins ian formed a broad shelf on which a thic. shore-face to offshore. shale-rich sequence was deposited. During the Late Kungurian. Kazanian. and Tartarian. the extent and nature of the shelf area was modified under the influence of a considerable influx of sand. Data evident from core. palyno• logical. and palaeoecological studies suggest that the organic matter pre• served in the Permian sequence con• tains a high proportion of oxidized material.

1330810,Prospectivity of Area AC93-3 on Australia's Northwest shelf,1994,IH Lavering,92,Oil and Gas Journal;(United States),8,,,During the last 10 years. the Australian government has regularly released acreage on the continental shelf for exploration. The intensity of exploration has increased dramatically during this time. but many parts of Australia still remain relatively underexplored. A little over 1.100 exploratory and development wells have been drilled on the Australian continental shelf the past 30 years--a small number by world standards and especially considering the Australia's offshore sedimentary basins cover about 12 million sq km. There remain good prospects for the discovery of oil and gas reserves in Australia. with the largest discoveries expected to be made on the continental shelf. Many of the areas recently released for bidding are underexplored and have good potential. This article examines one such area. Area AC93-3 lies largely in the Browse basin in the Timor Sea between Australia and Indonesia.

As such these predictions failed to take into account the dynamics of oil supply and demand of the crude oil market. and the dynamic nature of what is really measured by the'productive life of remaining reserves'.In fact Australia didn’t run out of oil in the time frame predicted by the local industry and we would have had a superior economic outcome over the past 40 years if a range of ‘market corrections’ been totally avoided.

Iran is the main saffron producer in the world with more than 88.000 hectares of cultivated area and annual production of 280 tons dried stigma. Mean stigma yield for the country is 3.2 kg ha-1. which is low compared with other countries with similar levels of production technology (Ebadzade at al.. 2016; Koocheki et al. 2016a). However. some Iranian leading farmers have produced up to 20 kg ha-1 stigma. which shows a high gap yield for saffron. Poor soil texture and structure. low soil organic matter and application of small mother corms are the main reasons for the high differences between potential and actual saffron yields (Behdani and Fallahi. 2015; Aghhavani Shajari et al. 2015). Bulb and corm size is the main factor to determine the flowering capacity in bulbous plants (Rezvani Moghaddam et al. 2014). Saffron yield in is very low in the first growing season. mainly due to inappropriate planting date and use of small corms (Behdani and Fallahi. 2015). Application of standard mother corms in saffron cultivation is a useful strategy to solve this problem. which also will prevent the waste of two years of cost. time. and water for the enlargement of small corms in flowering fields (Fallahi et al. 2016).

KG,The agricultural sector as a major supplier of food for a growing population is heavily dependent on energy resources. However. it should not be ignored that the indiscriminate use of fossil and nonrenewable energy sources in agriculture can have devastating effects on the environment so that by increasing the degree of mechanization of agricultural activities and the use of various machines in this segment. the use of fossil fuels has increased. These fuels are as one of the main sources of environmental pollution and rising greenhouse gas emissions in the present century (Maysami et al.. 2013). In recent decades. in the agricultural sector. energy consumption has increased due to population growth. reduction of arable lands. and improved living standards. To feed the growing population. there is a need for intensive use of chemical fertilizers. pesticides. agricultural machinery. electric energy. and natural resources (Barut et al.. 2010). This is while fossil resources are limited and the proper use of these resources with high productivity is vital to preserve them for the future generations of mankind (Brown et al.. 1998). On the other hand. the increased and intensive use of energy resources causes environmental problems (Alluvione et al.. 2011).

In this method. thin porous samples were weighed both dry and submerged in a wetting fluid. allowing their solid volume to be determined by application of Archimedes principle. The results showed that GDL porosity decreased as the amount of hydrophobic polymer additive was increased.

Material properties that depend on the dynamics of atoms can be predicted in terms of these atomic motions. yielding insight into atomic-level behaviors that ultimately dictate these properties. Such insight is crucial for developing a low-level understanding of material behavior. and MD simulations have been used to successfully predict properties for decades. Thermal transport properties in solids are largely dictated by collective atomic vibrations known as phonons. which can be understood and probed deeply through analysis of MD trajectories. The heart of MD simulations is the mathematical representation of potential energy between atoms. termed the interatomic potential. from which the forces and dynamics are calculated. The use of MD simulations to generally predict and describe thermal transport has not been fully realized due to the lack of accurate interatomic potentials for a variety of systems and obtaining accurate interatomic potentials is not a trivial task. Furthermore. it is not known how to create potentials that are guaranteed to accurately predict phonon properties. and this thesis seeks to answer this question.

1330948,Comparative study of ammonia-based clean rail transportation systems for Greater Toronto area,2014,Janette Hogerwaard,,,,,,Ammonia as a transportation fuel offers a carbon-free. hydrogen rich energy source that emits no greenhouse gases in combustion. and has no global warming potential. Furthermore. it may be produced from any renewable energy resource. and is a strong option for long term sustainability. Ammonia also provides a pathway towards a hydrogen economy. which is the long term goal for environmental sustainability. This thesis investigates the feasibility of integrating ammonia as a combustion fuel. hydrogen carrier. heat recovery and working fluid. and for indirect engine cooling. within locomotive propulsion systems for nine novel ammonia-based configurations. Thermodynamic. environmental. and economic analyses are conducted for a typical modern diesel-fueled locomotive and the proposed ammonia configurations. The study comparatively assesses potential long term solutions for sustainable. clean rail transportation. From the modeled results. the proposed systems operating with 50% of required fuel energy replaced by ammonia have a reduction in diesel fuel consumption from 0.211 kg/s to less than 0.10 kg/s. This is associated with a reduction in GHG emissions of more than 8 tonnes CO2eq for a typical daily locomotive duty cycle for commuter operation. Criteria air contaminants are reduced to below upcoming Tier 3 emission levels for NOx and HC emissions. and meet current levels for PM emissions. In total. ten locomotive propulsion systems are investigated including the diesel-fueled locomotive baseline. and the performance gains are considered against economic factors for fuel and equipment costs in a comparative assessment.,True,IdmTEu0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,http://ir.library.dc-uoit.ca/handle/10155/431,5817684442388624582,/scholar?cites=5817684442388624582,,,http://ir.library.dc-uoit.ca/bitstream/10155/431/1/Hogerwaard_Janette.PDF,0,0,0

1330951,Development and investigation of integrated solar systems for hydrogen and methanol production,2018,Janette Hogerwaard,,,,,,Implications of climate change. in particular the negative effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion. as well as the finite nature of fossil fuels necessitate the implementation of reliable and environmentally benign alternative energy options. This is particularly true for transportation and power generation sectors. which are responsible for the majority of carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that can be produced from renewable energy via electrolysis and direct photonic energy conversion from sunlight. produces no harmful emissions in combustion. and can be converted to electricity via fuel cells with good efficiency. However. it is challenging to store H2 in a cost and energy efficient manner. and it is not widely available to consumers in comparison to traditional liquid fuels for transportation applications. Storage of H2 produced from solar energy in synthetic fuels is a key step in moving towards an eventual hydrogen economy. By conversion to synthetic fuels such as methanol. hydrogen and solar energy may be directly utilised in current infrastructures as liquid fuels for transportation or in power generation applications.

Two-phase flow in parallel pipes takes place in heat exchangers. boilers and condensers in power plants and cooling systems. One of the attractive ways for utilizing solar energy for power is to construct an array of parallel pipes that absorb solar energy. Flow in parallel conduits may take place also in oil and gas production and within the core of a nuclear reactor. Ozawa et al.(1979. 1982. 1989) carried out experimental work on two-phase flow in capillary parallel pipes of 3.1 mm diameter. They attempted to simulate flow in boiling channels by the injection of air and water along the pipes. Reinecke et al.(1994) investigated flow reversal in vertical two-phase flow in parallel channels. Their experimental set up consists of six tubes with an inner diameter of 19.05 mm and a length of 1.3 m connecting a top and a bottom plenum.

Therefore. different bubble flow behavior can be observed between uniform and non-uniform heating conditions.

1331020,The Influence of Transverse Heat Flux Distribution on the Flow Instability for Subcooled Boiling Through a Narrow Rectangular Channel,2018,Omar S Al-Yahia and Taewoo Kim and Daeseong Jo,,,,,,Many engineering systems have a non-uniform power distribution. such as nuclear reactors. Different heat flux distributions lead to variation in local thermal hydraulic parameters; for single-phase and two-phase flow. Hence. areas that have high local heat flux initiate bubbles earlier compared to the low heat flux areas. Discrepancies in the Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB) were observed under uniform and non-uniform heat flux distribution in the transverse direction [1]. Different bubble generation may lead to different thermal hydraulic behavior through the flow channel. which especially appears after the significant bubble formation or significant void generation (SVG). Once the void fraction dramatically increases. mass and heat transfer instability occur through the channel. which is called Onset of Flow Instability (OFI). The flow channel remains stable when the slope of pump curve is lower than the one of system demand curve. On the other hand. once the slope of pump curve is higher than the one of system demand curve. the flow channels becomes unstable. In uniform heated channels. the OFI occurs at the same time with the Onset of Inlet Pressure Fluctuation (OIPF)[2]. A detailed review of flow instability under uniform heated channels is presented by Ruspini et al.[3]. Many experimental researches were conducted to investigate the OFI behavior in conventional and narrow channels [4-6]. Flow instability consideration is very important for designing a coolant systems that can operate under twophase flow conditions.

Most of research reactors use plate-type nuclear fuel. and coolant channel is narrow rectangular shape. Many researchers have investigated the ONB in a narrow rectangular channel. All previous investigations were performed under uniform heating condition. However. transversely non-uniform heating is encountered in the plate-type fuel research reactor. The power released from the edge of plate-type fuel is higher than the middle of plate-type fuel [1]. Al-Yahia et al.[2] investigated the effect of transverse power distribution on the subcoold boiling in a narrow channel.

1331023,Onset of Flow Instability in a Rectangular Channel Under Transversely Uniform and Non-uniform Heating,2017,Omar S Al-Yahia and Taewoo Kim and Daeseong Jo,,,,,,Flow instability in a narrow rectangular channel (2.35 mm x 54.0 mm x 300 mm) is studied under uniform and non-uniform heating conditions since the power released from the nuclear fuel is not uniform in the axial and transverse directions. Transverse non-uniform heating may cause local boiling where local heat flux is relatively higher than other locations. This may occur boiling locally. which disturb or generate a different velocity profile compared with that under uniform heating. The velocity profile change is significant when the flow condition reaches the Onset of Flow Instability (OFI). In the present study. an experimental facility has been designed to study the effects of non-uniform heating on the velocity profiles. Experiments are carried out using two different ways to reach the OFI;(1) decreases flow rate with constant power and (2) increases power with constant flow rate. When the flow reached the OFI. the pressure drop changes show different trends. This is because the flow travels faster where there is a significant boiling than that where there is not.

Biomass Gas can be used as a clean high-efficiency compression ignition fuel along with diesel. Biogas mainly comprises of hydrocarbon which is combustible like any hydrocarbons and can produce heat and energy when burnt. Biogas is a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide with traces of hydrogen sulphide. It is impracticable to store large volume of biogas at low pressures. It is therefore most economically used as it is produced. Biogas can be compressed and stored. or its fuel quality improved by removing carbon dioxide by chemical treatment. It is generally uneconomic to transport low and medium calorific value gases over long distance. It burns more completely than diesel fuels. It reduces greenhouse emissions. It is economical than diesel fuel. It creates job opportunities. It does not produce any harmful gas which causes cancer and smog. It can generate electricity at less cost. It gives assured regular fuel supplies. It does not enhance corrosion. In this project. engine performance test and smoke analysis was carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine. These tests were made with a series of blends of biogas with diesel. and a comparative study of performance for pure diesel and biogas blend were made. When biogas was blended with diesel the smoke emission was considerably reduced. but for pure diesel it was found to be more.

Here we investigate land-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) cycling through analysis of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and its component fluxes of gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) and soil carbon residence time. simulated by a set of land surface models (LSMs) over a region spanning the drainage basin of Northern Eurasia. The retrospective simulations cover the period 1960–2009 at 0.5° resolution. which is a scale common among many global carbon and climate model simulations. Model performance benchmarks were drawn from comparisons against both observed CO2 fluxes derived from site-based eddy covariance measurements as well as regional-scale GPP estimates based on satellite remote-sensing data. The site-based comparisons depict a tendency for overestimates in GPP and ER for several of the models. particularly at the two sites to the south. For several models the spatial pattern in GPP explains less than half the variance in the MODIS MOD17 GPP product. Across the models NEP increases by as little as 0.01 to as much as 0.79 g C m−2 yr−2. equivalent to 3 to 340 % of the respective model means. over the analysis period. For the multimodel average the increase is 135 % of the mean from the first to last 10 years of record (1960–1969 vs. 2000–2009). with a weakening CO2 sink over the latter decades.

While prior studies point to increasing temperatures as the principle environmental control. influences from moisture and other factors are less clear. We assess how changes in temperature. precipitation. cloudiness. and forest fires individually contribute to changes in GPP derived from satellite data across northern Eurasia using a light-use- efficiency-based model. for the period 1982–2010. We find that annual satellite-derived GPP is most sensitive to the temperature. precipitation and cloudiness of summer. which is the peak of the growing season and also the period of the year when the GPP trend is maximum. Considering the regional median. the summer temperature explains as much as 37.7 % of the variation in annual GPP. while precipitation and cloudiness explain 20.7 and 19.3 %.

This is mainly because of the increased albedo of deforested land which dominates over other biogeophysical and biogeochemical mechanisms in the energy balance. This dominance. however. may be due to an underestimation of the biogeochemical response. as carbon emissions are typically at or below the lower end of estimates. Here. we use the dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL for a better estimate of the carbon cycle under such large-scale deforestation. These studies are purely theoretical in order to understand the role of vegetation in the energy balance and the earth system. They must not be mistaken as possible mitigation options. because of the devastating effects on pristine ecosystems. For realistic assumptions of land suitability. the total emissions computed in this study are higher than that of previous studies assessing the effects of boreal deforestation. The warming due to biogeochemical effects ranges from 0.12 to 0.32 °C. depending on the climate sensitivity. Using LPJmL to assess the mitigation potential of bioenergy plantations in the suitable areas of the deforested region. we find that the global biophysical bioenergy potential is 68.1 ± 5.6 EJ yr−1 of primary energy at the end of the 21st century in the most plausible scenario. The avoided combustion of fossil fuels over the time frame of this experiment would lead to further cooling. However. since the carbon debt caused by the cumulative emissions is not repaid by the end of the 21st century. the global temperatures would increase by 0.04 to 0.11 °C.

Dry-cooling systems allow a water consumption reduction of up to 80% but at the expense of lower electricity production. A hybrid cooling system (the combination of dry and wet cooling) offers the advantages of each process in terms of lower water consumption and higher electricity production. A model of a CSP plant which integrates a hybrid cooling system has been implemented in Thermoflex software. The water consumption and the net power generation have been evaluated for different configurations of the hybrid cooling system: series. parallel. series-parallel and parallel-series. It was found that the most favourable configuration in terms of water saving was series-parallel. in which a water reduction of up to 50% is possible compared to the only-wet cooling option. whereas an increase of 2.5% in the power generation is possible compared to the only-dry cooling option. The parallel configuration was the best in terms of power generation with an increase of 3.2% when compared with the only-dry cooling option. and a reduction of 30% water consumption compared to the only-wet cooling option.

The performance of these cycles is significantly affected as the sCO 2 compressor inlet temperature moves away from the critical point which would be a function of ambient temperature. The precooler inlet temperature for a simple recuperative sCO 2 cycle is in the range of 100-120 C. and varies based on the recuperator effectiveness. compressor inlet temperature and cycle pressure ratio changes. This work explores the potential benefits of integrating an absorption chiller to recuperate the waste heat of the sCO 2 cycle to produce combined power and cooling. The combined power generation and cooling can significantly improve the primary energy utilisation efficiency as compared to its individual productions. In the proposed cycle. part of the cold energy is utilised for power block cooling and the rest for space cooling. This approach will not only allow the performance of the power plant to be less dependent on ambient conditions but also enhance the efficiency and allow reduction in the power plant water consumption. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the proposed integrated cycle efficiency can be enhanced up to 5% at an ambient temperature of 50 C. In addition. the absorption chiller is capable of providing 1300 tons of space cooling when the chiller is isolated from the pre-cooler. at a temperature of 45 C in the case of a 10 MW e sCO 2 power plant.,True,RLs3VFgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/thermodynamic-performance-of-a-supercritical-cosub2sub-cycle-inte,,,,,,0,0,0

Working fluid mixtures employed in the absorption cooling systems are environmental friendly and do not contribute in green house gas emission when compared to vapour compression systems which also use costly mechanical energy input. However. high initial costs and bigger size are some of the main obstacles that impede their wide use in small scale residential buildings and transport sector. In order to overcome these obstacles. design and configuration of the system and its components need to be reinvestigated in order to achieve compact components and reduce the size of the system.

1331107,Understanding the concept of nationally appropriate mitigation action,2013,Sudhir Sharma and Denis Desgain,,,,,,This publication is intended to enable national policy makers and other stakeholders. such as the private sector and technical experts. to acquaint themselves with the concept of NAMA. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) concept and enhance the understanding of NAMAs by explaining the underlying decisions of the Conference of the Parties in layman's terms. The first chapter describes how the concept of NAMA emerged in the context of the negotiations on climate change. The chapter gives an overview of how the concepts of NAMA and related MRV and financing issues have evolved through the different COPs. The second chapter clarifies the understanding of NAMAs in the context of the global temperature goal. and moves on to discuss the legal nature and scope of NAMAs. The chapter subsequently analyses the diversity of NAMAs submitted by developing countries to the UNFCCC. and ends by proposing a structure for formal submission of a NAMA. The third chapter specifically addresses the concept of measurement. reporting and verification (MRV). and describes the implications for countries implementing the MRV requirements. The last chapter discusses institutional arrangements. under the Convention. for providing financing to develop and implement NAMAs. The chapter also briefly discusses the different financial sources for implementing NAMAs. and concludes by explaining the concept of incremental cost in this specific context.

The primary focus is on the financial and economic barriers identified by countries to the transfer of prioritized low-carbon energy technologies. While many electricity markets in Latin America were liberalized during the 1990s and 2000s. such market-driven reform policies were far from uniform and in reality there exist a diversity of governance frameworks for national electricity markets. exemplified here by Argentina. Cuba. Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.

Tanzania and Zambia,2013,James Arthur Haselip and Denis Desgain and Gordon A Mackenzie,,,,,,This report presents the findings of research into the main outcomes of government and donor-backed efforts to promote small and medium-sized energy businesses (energy SMEs) in sub-Saharan Africa. The research follows an outcome analysis methodology. The focus is on four countries: Ghana. Senegal. Tanzania and Zambia and primarily on UNEP's AREED programme (2002-2012). This research focuses on the 'contributing factors' - a deliberately broader term that incorporates the internal 'success factors' - for energy SMEs. about which much has already been written. Indeed. the research findings presented in this report reaffirm most of what has been concluded in previous studies. These studies identified the lack of access to affordable finance as being the predominant. persistent. barrier to establishing and scaling up a commercially viable energy SME sector. emphasising the lack of strong policy support from governments. poor business skills capacity and the high cost of many RETs as related cause-and-effect barriers. While these issues continue to characterise. to a greater or lesser extent. the energy SMEs sectors in the countries studied for this research. it is more relevant to revisit the main assumption behind AREED and other donor-backed programmes designed to promote energy SMEs. The assumption is that the solution to the aforementioned barriers would be overcome by a 'demonstration effect' whereby successful energy SMEs. supported by donor-backed programmes. influence the commercial financial sector to invest in energy SMEs. thus triggering a virtuous circle of growth and profitability.

One upazila from each district and three villages from each upazila were selected randomly. Fifty farmers were selected from each village having at least 5 ducks throughout the year. Thus. a total of 300 farmers were selected for this study. The informations were collected by using an interview schedule. The majority of the farmers (39%) belonged to middle-aged category. Thirty per cent farmers have got primary level of education. About 50 per cent farmers had large family size having an average of 7 persons per family. Twenty seven per cent farmers had small land size with an average of 1.00 ha per household. Sixty one per cent of the respondents considered agriculture as a main occupation. About 99 per cent farmers annually earned Taka 1502.00 from duck rearing. The majority of farmers (82.25%) are rearing Desi ducks followed by Crossbred (12%) and Hybrid (5.75%). Forty four per cent of the farmers cleaned their duck houses 2-3 times in a month whereas only 11 per cent cleaned their duck houses everyday. 22 per cent once in month. 18 per cent 4-6 times in a month and 5 per cent farmers cleaned their duck houses 7-10 times in a month.

Synthetic B. napus had increased growth over parents and exhibited wider ranges with higher coefficients of variations than parents for morphological and yield contributing characters. and yield per plant. Siliqua length as well as beak length in synthetic B. napus was longer than those of the parents. Number of seeds per siliqua. 1000-seed weight and seed yield per plant in synthetic B. napus were higher than those of the parents. Although flowering time in synthetic B. napus was earlier than both parents. however the days to maturity was little higher over early maturing B. rapa parent. The synthesized B. napus has great potential to produce higher seed yield.

This urges for vertical expansion of agriculture. A large part of Barind area. north-western part of Bangladesh. suffers from dryness due to low and erratic rainfall. remains fallow during winter and dry season period. This study attempted to increase cropping intensity through conserving and utilizing profile soil moisture and minimal supplemental irrigation application. Rice-Fallow-Fallow. Rice-Chickpea-Sesame. Rice-Chickpea-Mungbean cropping patterns with different irrigation and mulching practices for dry-season crops were investigated. and economic analyses were performed to find out the most economic pattern couple with minimal irrigation water application. From the results of field experiments and economic analyses. Rice-Chickpea-Mungbean pattern identified the best as with ‘Binadhan-7’for transplant Aman rice.‘Binasola-4’for chickpea. and ‘Binamoog-5’for mungbean. A net profit of BDT 1. 38.850.00 per hectare equivalent to US $1.734 can be obtained from this practice applying 6 cm water in dry-season crops chickpea and mungbean. which is BDT 94.468.00 equivalent to US $1.181 per hectare higher than the existing local pattern.

Patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) were known to have higher prevalence of GERD in the Western countries. but data on the impact of GERD on DM patients in our country are scarce. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the presence of GERD in type II DM patients admitted at the Department of Medicine. Mymensingh Medical College Hospital. Mymensingh. Bangladesh from April 2015 to September 2015. A total of 137 type II DM cases were purposively collected. Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ) was used to check the presence of GERD. Patient's characteristics. laboratory data. face-to-face interview data were analyzed. Out of 137 type 2 DM patients 108 were suffering from GERD giving a prevalence rate of 78.8% which is quite high. Pathophysiological factors like age. sex. duration of DM. weight. waist circumference (WC) had no significant difference between GERD-DM and non-GERD-type II DM patients. Only hypertension and frequent eating fatty food were found to have significant differences between the two groups. From the study findings it could be said that the higher rate of GERD in patients with type II DM may be associated with lifestyle factor and some pathophysiological factors like hypertension.

East. South and Southeast Asia. Mutation-based breeding is to develop and improve plant varieties by modifying one or two major traits to increase their productivity or quality in a relatively short time than conventional breeding. This is now widely used in agriculture to get the success rapidly. The present study inspects the effect of chronic gamma irradiation on rice (Binadhan-8. NMR-152 and Pongsuseribu-2) varieties. Rice seedlings at the age of 14 days were exposed to chronic gamma irradiation (low dose rate radiation) in Gamma Green House (GGH) at Malaysian Nuclear Agency for 60 days. The treated seedlings were designated in three replicates. The accumulated doses received by the rice plants were from 29 to 639 Gy for 60 days. Control plants were grown outside the gamma green house. The plant heights were recorded every week after planting in GGH. Effects of radiation were measured in terms of plant height. number of tiller and number of filled grain produced. At cumulative doses of 67 and 162 Gy (0.07 and 0.17 Gy/hr. respectively). the rice seedlings showed the highest plant height with maximum tillering and highest number of filled grain. Those rates are stimulating to the growth and development of the plants.

Sıvı hidrojen üretimi için modellenen sistemin termodinamik performansı ORC sistemlerinde kullanılan farklı soğutucu akışkanlar (R123. R245fa. R601. n-Hexane) için farklı buharlaştırıcı sıcaklıklarında (100⁰C-150⁰C) incelenmiştir. Ayrıca çalışma kapsamında farklı sıvılaştırma çevrimleri ve absorbsiyonlu soğutma sisteminde kullanılan eriyik çiftleri dikkate alınarak hidrojen üretim sistemi için altı farklı model oluşturulmuştur. Modellerin enerji ve ekserji analizleri gerçekleştirilmiş. sıvı hidrojen üretim performansları karşılaştırılmış ve sistem için optimum çalışma parametreleri belirlenmiştir. Optimum çalışma şartları için eksergoekonomik analizler gerçekleştirilmiş ve sistemi oluşturan komponentlerin eksergoekonomik performansları değerlendirilmiştir. Oluşturulan tüm modeller birlikte ele alındığında. ön soğutmalı Claude sıvılaştırma sisteminin kullanıldığı ve absorbsiyonlu soğutma çevriminde NH3-H2O eriyik çiftinin tercih edildiği Model 2’nin termodinamik performansının diğer modellere kıyasla daha yüksek olduğu ve hidrojen üretim miktarı açısından ise daha kullanılabilir olduğu belirlenmiştir. Sabit çalışma şartlarında. soğutucu akışkan ve buharlaştırıcı sıcaklığına bağlı olarak Model 2’de üretilen hidrojen miktarı maksimum 0.18049 kg/s olarak hesaplanmış. enerji ve ekserji verimi ise …,True,g3Wn20QAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://acikerisim.uludag.edu.tr/handle/11452/18281,,,,,https://acikerisim.uludag.edu.tr/bitstream/11452/18281/1/Ali_H%C3%BCsn%C3%BC_BADEML%C4%B0O%C4%9ELU.pdf,0,0,0

Bina yapı elemanı içerisinde yoğuşmanın başlamaması için gerekli minimum yalıtım kalınlığı belirlenmiştir. Yapı elemanında ısı ve kütle transferi hesaplamaları. farklı iç-dış ortam sıcaklığı ve bağıl nem koşulları için yapılmış ve sonuçlar grafik yardımıyla aktarılmıştır. Genel olarak. gerekli yalıtım kalınlığı iç ortam sıcaklığı ve bağıl neminin artmasıyla artarken. dış ortam sıcaklık ve bağıl neminin artmasıyla azalmaktadır. Duvar yapı malzemesinden geçen su buharı miktarı ise iç ve dış koşulların yanı sıra kullanılan yalıtım kalınlığıyla da değişmektedir.,True,g3Wn20QAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,http://acikerisim.uludag.edu.tr/handle/11452/8779,,,,,http://acikerisim.uludag.edu.tr/bitstream/11452/8779/1/360458.pdf,0,0,0
