1044031,Autophagy and disease: always two sides to a problem,2012,Sunandini Sridhar and Yair Botbol and Fernando Macian and Ana Maria Cuervo,226,The Journal of pathology,2,255-273,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,Autophagy is a process traditionally known to contribute to cellular cleaning through the removal of intracellular components in lysosomes. In recent years. intensive scrutiny at the molecular level to which autophagy has been subjected has also contributed to expanding our understanding of the physiological role of this pathway. Added to the well‐characterized role in quality control. autophagy has proved to be important in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and of the energetic balance. in cellular and tissue remodelling. and cellular defence against extracellular insults and pathogens. It is not a surprise that. in light of this growing number of physiological functions. connections between autophagic malfunction and human pathologies have also been strengthened. In this review. we focus on several pathological conditions associated with primary or secondary defects in autophagy and comment on a …,True,ush5aacAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,262,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/path.3025,6994061218535826017,/scholar?cites=6994061218535826017,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/path.3025,0,0,0

Here we found that CMA was activated in T cells in response to engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). which induced expression of the CMA-related lysosomal receptor LAMP-2A. In activated T cells. CMA targeted the ubiquitin ligase Itch and the calcineurin inhibitor RCAN1 for degradation to maintain activation-induced responses. Consequently. deletion of the gene encoding LAMP-2A in T cells caused deficient in vivo responses to immunization or infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Impaired CMA activity also occurred in T cells with age. which negatively affected their function. Restoration of LAMP-2A in T cells from old mice resulted in enhancement of activation-induced responses.

However. the cellular origin of WAT fibrosis remains unclear. Here. we show that adipocyte platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α-positive (PDGFRα+) progenitors adopt a fibrogenic phenotype in obese mice prone to visceral WAT fibrosis. More specifically. a subset of PDGFRα+ cells with high CD9 expression (CD9high) originates pro-fibrotic cells whereas their CD9low counterparts. committed to adipogenesis. are almost completely lost in the fibrotic WAT. PDGFRα pathway activation promotes a phenotypic shift toward PDGFRα+CD9high fibrogenic cells. driving pathological remodeling and altering WAT function in obesity.

1044035,Functional coupling between HIV-1 integrase and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex for efficient in vitro integration into stable nucleosomes,2011,Paul Lesbats and Yair Botbol and Guillaume Chevereau and Cédric Vaillant and Christina Calmels and Alain Arneodo and Marie-Line Andreola and Marc Lavigne and Vincent Parissi,7,PLoS Pathog,2,e1001280,Public Library of Science,Establishment of stable HIV-1 infection requires the efficient integration of the retroviral genome into the host DNA. The molecular mechanism underlying the control of this process by the chromatin structure has not yet been elucidated. We show here that stably associated nucleosomes strongly inhibit in vitro two viral-end integration by decreasing the accessibility of DNA to integrase. Remodeling of the chromatinized template by the SWI/SNF complex. whose INI1 major component interacts with IN. restores and redirects the full-site integration into the stable nucleosome region. These effects are not observed after remodeling by other human remodeling factors such as SNF2H or BRG1 lacking the integrase binding protein INI1. This suggests that the restoration process depends on the direct interaction between IN and the whole SWI/SNF complex. supporting a functional coupling between the remodeling and integration complexes. Furthermore. in silico comparison between more than 40.000 non-redundant cellular integration sites selected from literature and nucleosome occupancy predictions also supports that HIV-1 integration is promoted in the genomic region of weaker intrinsic nucleosome density in the infected cell. Our data indicate that some chromatin structures can be refractory for integration and that coupling between nucleosome remodeling and HIV-1 integration is required to overcome this natural barrier.,True,ush5aacAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,62,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001280,18057200605111903633,/scholar?cites=18057200605111903633,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1001280,0,0,0

Through the ability to adjust the cell's proteome in response to different stimuli. different forms of autophagy have been shown to control T‐cell homeostasis and survival. Autophagic processes can also determine the magnitude of the T‐cell response to TCR engagement. by regulating the cellular levels of specific signaling intermediates and modulating the metabolic output in activated T cells. In this review we will examine the mechanisms that control autophagy activity in T cells. such as ROS signaling and signaling through common gamma‐chain cytokine receptors. and the different aspect of T‐cell biology. including T‐cell survival. effector cell function. and generation of memory. which can be regulated by autophagy.,True,ush5aacAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,37,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eji.201545955,10976579671086298594,/scholar?cites=10976579671086298594,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/eji.201545955,0,0,0

Previous studies have shown that macroautophagy is induced in activated T cells to regulate organelle homeostasis and the cell's energy metabolism. However. the signaling pathways that initiate and regulate activation-induced macroautophagy in T cells have not been identified. Here. we show that activation-induced macroautophagy in T cells depends on signaling from common γ-chain cytokines. Consequently. inhibition of signaling through JAK3. induced downstream of cytokine receptors containing the common γ-chain. prevents full induction of macroautophagy in activated T cells. Moreover. we found that common γ-chain cytokines are not only required for macroautophagy upregulation during T cell activation but can themselves induce macroautophagy.

CD4+ T cells upregulate autophagy. However. the functional consequences of that upregulation have not been fully elucidated. In this study. we identify autophagy as a tolerance-avoidance mechanism. Our data show that inhibition of autophagy during CD4+ T cell activation induces a long-lasting state of hypo-responsiveness that is accompanied by the expression of an anergic gene signature. Cells unable to induce autophagy after T cell receptor (TCR) engagement show inefficient mitochondrial respiration and decreased turnover of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN1. which translates into defective TCR-mediated signaling.

We generated a conditional triple-H1-knockout mouse strain and depleted H1 in haematopoietic cells. H1 depletion in T cells leads to de-repression of T cell activation genes. a process that mimics normal T cell activation.

Lipids are transferred from the plant to mycorrhizal fungi. which are fatty acid auxotrophs. and this lipid export requires the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase RAM2. a direct target of RAM1.

Here. we show that disruption of TAG hydrolysis in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) lipase mutant sugar-dependent1 (sdp1) leads to a substantial accumulation of TAG in roots and stems but comparatively much lower TAG accumulation in leaves. TAG content in sdp1 roots increases with the age of the plant and can reach more than 1% of dry weight at maturity. a 50-fold increase over the wild type. TAG accumulation in sdp1 roots requires both ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (DGAT1) and PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 and can also be strongly stimulated by the provision of exogenous sugar.

Adaptor proteins. which can localize to different subcellular compartments. where they bring together key signaling proteins. are emerging as attractive candidates for controlling spatially coordinated processes. However. their function in regulating cell migration is not well understood. In this study. we demonstrate a novel role for the adaptor protein containing a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain. phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain. and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1) in regulating cell migration. APPL1 impairs migration by hindering the turnover of adhesions at the leading edge of cells.

IL1RAPL1 protein physically interacts with neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1). but the functional impact of the IL1RAPL1/NCS-1 interaction remains unknown. Here. we demonstrate that stable expression of IL1RAPL1 in PC12 cells induces a specific silencing of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (N-VGCC) activity that explains a secretion deficit observed in these IL1RAPL1 cells. Importantly. this modulation of VGCC activity is mediated by NCS-1. Indeed. a specific loss-of-function of N-VGCC was observed in PC12 cells overexpressing NCS-1. and a total recovery of N-VGCC activity was obtained by a down-regulation of NCS-1 in IL1RAPL1 cells.

ET-intoxicated animals express severe neurological disorders that are thought to result from the formation of vasogenic brain edemas and indirect neuronal excitotoxicity. The cerebellum is a predilection site for ET damage. ET has been proposed to bind to glial cells such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However. the possibility that ET binds and attacks the neurons remains an open question. Using specific anti-ET mouse polyclonal antibodies and mouse brain slices preincubated with ET. we found that several brain structures were labeled. the cerebellum being a prominent one. In cerebellar slices. we analyzed the co-staining of ET with specific cell markers. and found that ET binds to the cell body of granule cells. oligodendrocytes. but not astrocytes or nerve endings. Identification of granule cells as neuronal ET targets was confirmed by the observation that ET induced intracellular Ca2+ rises and glutamate release in primary cultures of granule cells. In cultured cerebellar slices. whole cell patch-clamp recordings of synaptic currents in Purkinje cells revealed that ET greatly stimulates both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory activities. However. pharmacological dissection of these effects indicated that they were only a result of an increased granule cell firing activity and did not involve a direct action of the toxin on glutamatergic nerve terminals or inhibitory interneurons.

Because of the many different calcium‐binding proteins distributed throughout cells. signalling precision requires localized rises in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. In electrically non‐excitable cells. for example epithelial cells. this is achieved by primary release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum via Ca2+ release channels placed close to the physiological target. Because any rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates Ca2+ extrusion. and in order for cells not to run out of Ca2+. there is a need for compensatory Ca2+ uptake from the extracellular fluid. This Ca2+ uptake occurs through a process known as store‐operated Ca2+ entry.

SOCE is mediated by coupling of STIM1. the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor. to the Orai1 channel.

STIM1 has several functional domains. including the Orai1 interaction domain (STIM1 Orai Activating Region (SOAR) or CRAC Activation Domain (CAD)) and STIM1 homomerization domain.

Caspase-2 and AID. An OCRE (OCtamer REpeat of aromatic residues) domain found in RBM5 is important for alternative splicing regulation and mediates interactions with components of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. We show that the RBM5 OCRE domain adopts a unique β–sheet fold. NMR and biochemical experiments demonstrate that the OCRE domain directly binds to the proline-rich C-terminal tail of the essential snRNP core proteins SmN/B/B’. The NMR structure of an OCRE-SmN peptide complex reveals a specific recognition of poly-proline helical motifs in SmN/B/B’. Mutation of conserved aromatic residues impairs binding to the Sm proteins in vitro and compromises RBM5-mediated alternative splicing regulation of FAS/CD95. Thus. RBM5 OCRE represents a poly-proline recognition domain that mediates critical interactions with the C-terminal tail of the spliceosomal SmN/B/B’ proteins in FAS/CD95 alternative splicing regulation.,True,rPdUQREAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,14,https://elifesciences.org/articles/14707,13056856709754846546,/scholar?cites=13056856709754846546,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/14707.pdf,0,0,0
1044107,Crystal structure of intraflagellar transport protein 80 reveals a homo-dimer required for ciliogenesis,2018,Michael Taschner and Anna Lorentzen and Andre Mourao and Toby Collins and Grace M Freke and Dale Moulding and Jerome Basquin and Dagan Jenkins and Esben Lorentzen,7,Elife,,e33067,eLife Sciences Publications Limited,Oligomeric assemblies of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles build cilia through sequential recruitment and transport of ciliary cargo proteins within cilia. Here we present the 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the Chlamydomonas IFT-B protein IFT80. which reveals the architecture of two N-terminal β-propellers followed by an α-helical extension. The N-terminal β-propeller tethers IFT80 to the IFT-B complex via IFT38 whereas the second β-propeller and the C-terminal α-helical extension result in IFT80 homo-dimerization. Using CRISPR/Cas to create biallelic Ift80 frameshift mutations in IMCD3 mouse cells. we demonstrate that IFT80 is absolutely required for ciliogenesis. Structural mapping and rescue experiments reveal that human disease-causing missense mutations do not cluster within IFT80 and form functional IFT particles. Unlike missense mutant forms of IFT80. deletion of the C-terminal dimerization domain prevented rescue of ciliogenesis. Taken together our results may provide a first insight into higher order IFT complex formation likely required for IFT train formation.,True,rPdUQREAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,13,https://elifesciences.org/articles/33067,5316056657645831974,/scholar?cites=5316056657645831974,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/33067.pdf,0,0,0

Currently. the methylation epigenetic silencing of miRNAs with tumor suppressor features by CpG island hypermethylation is emerging as a common hallmark of different tumors. Here we showed that miR-433 and miR-127 were significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues compared with the adjacent normal regions in 86 paired samples. Moreover. the lower level of miR-433 and miR-127 was associated with pM or pTNM stage in clinical gastric cancer patients. The restored expression of miR-433 and miR-127 in GC cells upon 5-Aza-CdR and TSA treatment suggested the loss of miR-433 and miR-127 was at least partly regulated by epigenetic modification in GC. Furthermore. the ectopic expression of miR-433 and miR-127 in gastric cancer cell lines HGC-27 inhibits cell proliferation. cell cycle progression. cell migration and invasion by directly interacting with the mRNA encoding oncogenic factors KRAS and MAPK4 respectively. Taken together. our results showed that miR-433 and miR-127 might act as tumor suppressors in GC. and it may provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for human GC clinical operation in the near future.

In this study we investigated the role of nitric oxide and PKC in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated vascular hyporeactivity. METHODS: Contraction to phenylephrine and endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilation in the presence and absence of a nonspecific NO inhibitor (L-NAME) and potent PKC inhibitor (chelerythrine) were examined. RESULTS: In LPS treated rats. contractile response of aortic rings to phenylephrine and relaxation in response to acetylcholine were reduced. but relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside remained unchanged. The attenuation of contractile response to phenylephrine in the presence of L-NAME and chelerythrine was more pronounced in aortic ring isolated from LPS treated rats than control. L-NAME decreased acetylcholine-dependent vasodilation in both group but it was more pronounced in LPS treated rats. Chelerythrine pretreatment improved maximal relaxation to acetylcholine in aortic ring isolated from LPS treated rats. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the vascular hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine and acetylcholine after treatment with LPS may be related to an enhanced NO production in the smooth muscle cells and PKC plays a role as an intracellular mediator of LPS-induce NOS activity and vascular suppression.,True,Urhyd30AAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,23,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zahra_Gholamnezhad/publication/6936862_The_role_of_nitric_oxide_and_protein_kinase_C_in_lipopolysaccharidemediated_vascular_hyporeactivity/links/58f7888c0f7e9bfcf93bdd44/The-role-of-nitric-oxide-and-protein-kinase-C-in-lipopolysaccharidemediated-vascular-hyporeactivity.pdf,7158570209512270916,/scholar?cites=7158570209512270916,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zahra_Gholamnezhad/publication/6936862_The_role_of_nitric_oxide_and_protein_kinase_C_in_lipopolysaccharidemediated_vascular_hyporeactivity/links/58f7888c0f7e9bfcf93bdd44/The-role-of-nitric-oxide-and-protein-kinase-C-in-lipopolysaccharidemediated-vascular-hyporeactivity.pdf,0,0,0

We directly identified and quantitatively compared sites of replication initiation and termination in untransformed human cells. We found that replication preferentially initiates at the transcription start site of genes occupied by high levels of RNA polymerase II. and terminates at their polyadenylation sites. thereby ensuring global co-directionality of transcription and replication. particularly at gene 5′ ends. During replication stress. replication initiation is stimulated downstream of genes and termination is redistributed to gene bodies; this globally reorients replication relative to transcription around gene 3′ ends.

One of the most important applications of Ag-NPs is their use as an anti-bacterial agent. The use of plants in the synthesis of nanoparticles emerges as a cost effective and eco-friendly approach. In this study the biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Vitex negundo L. extract and its antimicrobial properties has been reported. The resulting silver particles are characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV–Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopic techniques. The TEM study showed the formation of silver nanoparticles in the 10–30 nm range and average 18.2 nm in size. The XRD study showed that the particles are crystalline in nature. with a face centered cubic (fcc) structure. The silver nanoparticles showed the antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.

1044143,RAPD analysis of somadonal variation in banana (Musa acuminate L.) cultivar Valery,2008,Masoud Sheidai,52,Acta Biologica Szegediensis,2,307-311,,Thirty decamer RAPD primers were used to study somaclonal variation among the parental plants as well as regenerated plants of the first. third. fifth. seventh and ninth sub-cultures. Eighteen out of thirty primers produced 289 bands in all the genotypes studied. Hundred and forty-two bands (48.95%) were common in the parental genotype and the regenerated plants while 147 bands were polymorph (51.40%). Among the primers used. OPI-07 produced the highest number of bands (24) while primers OPH-16 produced the lowest number (5). In total 74 specific bands were observed in the parental genotype and the regenerated plants of the sub-cultures. The presence of specific band/loci in the parental plants and loss of it in the regenerated plants of different sub-cultures indicates the loss of certain loci during tissue culture due to somaclonal variation. Such specific loci are of high importance in the genetic identification of the genotypes or somaclones from each other. Grouping of the parental cultivar and their sub-cultures regenerated plants indicate the genetic distinctness of the genotypes studied as they are placed in different clusters/groups far from each other.
