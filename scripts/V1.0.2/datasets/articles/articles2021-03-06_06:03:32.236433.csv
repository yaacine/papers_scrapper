GSCM is especially important in the construction industry. a project-based business that often results in heavy environmental pollution. For the successful implementation of GSCM in the construction industry to occur. contractors should make the best use of suppliers’ environmental capabilities based on shared understanding of the capabilities. This paper examines the shared understanding of suppliers’ environmental management capabilities between the contractor and suppliers by assessing the consistency between the contractor’s and suppliers’ evaluations of the capabilities. This explorative case study investigates a supply chain comprised of a major construction firm and 106 suppliers in Korea. The results of the case analysis show that the suppliers’ self-evaluation scores of environmental capability are higher than the contractor’s evaluation scores. Furthermore. from both evaluators. suppliers received the lowest scores in the evaluation item rating the relationship with second-tier suppliers and the highest in the evaluation item rating the relationship with the contractor. The consistency between the suppliers’ and contractor’s evaluation is related to several characteristics of suppliers. such as industry type. firm size and partnership duration with the contractor. This study contributes to the literature of GSCM and strategic alignment amongst supply chain partners for the construction industry.

The appropriability regime enables SMEs to secure financial returns on their R&D investment so that SMEs can continuously invest in innovation and obtain financial gains. However. the appropriability regime can change the effects of protecting innovation outcomes depending on the capacity of knowledge exploration. especially for SMEs. and previous studies have not discussed these issues. Thus. the main objective of this paper is to explore how the knowledge exploration capacity affects the relationship between different types of appropriability regimes and innovation performance. Multivariate regression is used to analyze the manufacturing SMEs sampled from the Korea Innovation Survey 2007 (KIS 2007). Our results demonstrate that both formal and informal appropriability regimes can improve firm’s innovation performance. Furthermore. although both inventive and absorptive capacity have positive moderating effects on the relationship between the informal appropriability regime and innovation performance. the inventive capacity moderates negatively the relationship between the formal appropriability regime and innovation performance. As a whole. the significance of this paper lies in providing further understanding of the different types of appropriability regimes and knowledge exploration capacity in SMEs.

Toward this end. the so-called advanced decelerated depreciation method (ADDM) was developed that complements the limitations of the existing depreciation methods such as the straight-line method and fixed percentage of declining-balance method.

A THC. which is a new incubation model. is a specialised organisation for establishing spin-offs as subsidiaries and commercialising university inventions. This study verifies the effects of THCs on the incubation productivity of universities by conducting a propensity-score matching and two-stage data envelopment analysis. The results show that. in the university group with high entrepreneurial orientation. universities with a THC are less productive in the invention stage but more productive in the commercialisation stage than universities without a THC. This demonstrates that THCs decrease productivity in the invention stage by playing the role of a gatekeeper but. in the commercialisation stage. increase productivity by playing the role of a sponsor.

This is because the selection of an alternative cannot be justified without a guarantee of economic feasibility. The calculation of a break-even point is necessary because SFR capital investment cost makes up the largest share of the cost for electricity generation. In other words. the cost of capital investment is an important cost driver. and the one that exerts the greatest effect on Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle economics. In the end. the break-even point of the SFR capital investment cost between the Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle and the direct disposal was calculated to be 4284 US $/kWe. In other words. it is possible to claim that the potential for the economic viability of the Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle is greater (compared to investing in direct disposal) when the SFR capital investment cost is 4284 US $/kWe or less. In addition. Pyro-SFR technology will enable sustainable nuclear power generation.

The etchant gases resulted in the highest etch rate of ZnO. suggesting that the etching of Zn in ZnO largely involves a process in which a volatile metallorganic zinc compound. such as is formed. The etch rate was increased with increasing rf table power. and the highest etch rate of 2000 Å/min was achieved at an rf table power of 200 W (dc bias:− 80 V). As the ICP power was increased. the etch rate also increased. which suggests that the plasma density is also an important factor in this process.

In the work. we fabricate an inverted CdSe/ZnS quantum dot (QD) based light-emitting diodes (QDLED). In order to reduce work function of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode for inverted structure. a very thin (< 10 nm) polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) is used as surface modifier [1] instead of conventional metal oxide electron injection layer. The PEIE layer substantially reduces the work function of ITO electrodes which is estimated to be 3.08 eV by ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). From transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study. CdSe/ZnS QDs are uniformly distributed and formed by a monolayer on PEIE layer. In this inverted QDLEDs. blend of poly (9. 9-di-n-octyl-fluorene-alt-benzothiadiazolo) and poly (N. N'-bis (4-butylphenyl)-N. N'-bis (phenyl) benzidine] are used as hole transporting layer (HTL) to improve hole transporting property. At the operating voltage of 8 V. the QDLED device emitted spectrally orange color lights with high luminance up to 2450 cd/m2. and showed current efficacy of 0.6 cd/A. respectively.,True,Vp6MSIAAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/CFKO201402641318349.page,,,,,0,0,0

The perovskite seeds serve as cesium sources and act as nuclei to facilitate crystallization during the formation of perovskite.

A q-Markov COVER is a state realization which matches exactly a finite portion of the impulse response sequence (Markov parameters) and output autocorrelation sequence (covariance parameters) of a linear system.

For monitoring the soil moisture content. we have used an in-house developed sensor. In the proposed network. the IITH mote is used as a sink and sensor node which provides low-power communication. We have evaluated our network with state of the art networks. proposed for agriculture monitoring. Power and cost are the two metrics used for evaluation of these networks.

To compute fused pixel value. we take weighted average of the source pixels. where the weight to be given to the pixel is adaptively decided based on the significance of the pixel. which in turn is decided by the corresponding children pixels in the finer resolution bands.

We establish a threshold result for this model: if the largest cluster size is smaller than C 1  log(mn) (where the rating matrix is of size m × n). then the underlying matrix cannot be recovered with any estimator. but if the smallest cluster size is larger than C 2  log(mn). then we show a polynomial time estimator with asymptotically vanishing probability of error.

Recently. it was shown that for a network of unit capacity links with either m = 2 or n = 2. the sum of the sources can be communicated to the terminals using scalar/vector linear network coding if and only if every source-terminal pair is connected in the network. We show in this paper that for any finite set of primes. there exists a network where the sum of the sources can be communicated to the terminals only over finite fields of characteristic belonging to that set. As a corollary. this gives networks where the sum can not be communicated over any finite field using vector linear network coding even though every source is connected to every terminal.,True,rl5cEtwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,21,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5191400/,4210660536103823130,/scholar?cites=4210660536103823130,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0811.0285,0,0,0

The bounds are obtained for three different nonregenerative relaying schemes. The lower bounds for the BER are obtained using the moment generating function (MGF) approach by evaluating the MGF of the end-to-end equivalent signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the system. From the BER expressions obtained. we also show that the diversity order for the MIMO relay cooperative system with each relay having M antennas increases approximately by a factor M from that of a system with single-antenna relays.

The parameter estimates of the arrival processes are obtained as the minimizer of a cost function between the empirical and calculated distributions. We also carry out extensive simulations and numerical experiments on the model to study the performance of the estimation algorithm for some non stationary arrival process.

Management of late blight has become more challenging during the last few decades because of the emergence of new virulent races of pathogen. especially A2 mating type (Daayf et al.. 2001; Kato et al.. 1997; Lambert and Currier. 1997) rendering newly released resistant potato cultivars susceptible in 5-7 years time the world over. including India. Hence. the only option left to manage late blight in these cultivars was the application of fungicides which have further complicated the situation with the appearance of fungicide resistant races. Therefore. quest for new alternative sources will always remain a priority so that the low to moderate level of resistance in such cultivars can be supplemented minimizing the use of fungicides that have a range of negative effects on humans and environment.Several microorganisms have been used against plant disease for decades. A well known group of microorganism used is the fluorescent Pseudomonas which excretes secondary metabolites including antibiotics and biosurfactants that are inhibitory to plant pathogens (Haas and Defago. 2005).

1151091,Identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain producing biosurfactant with antifungal activity against Phytophthora infestans,2013,Sonica Tomar and BA Singh and MA Khan and Satish Kumar and Sanjeev Sharma and Mehi Lal,40,Potato Journal,2,,,Biosurfactant is a structurally diverse group of surface-active molecules. synthesized by microorganisms. The ability to reduce surface and interfacial tension with low toxicity and high specificity and biodegradability is a major characteristic of a biosurfactant. In the present study. soil samples were collected from agriculture fields. railway tracks and garage sites. The samples were enriched in nutrient broth. serially diluted and plated onto nutrient agar plates. A total of ninety five isolates obtained from nineteen soil samples were screened for their biosurfactant producing capacity using oil spreading. haemolytic activity. drop collapse. tilted glass slide. emulsification index (%) and emulsification assays. Out of these. the five isolates with a very good capacity to produce biosurfactant were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa through PCR technique using Pseudomonas genus specific primers (PA-30) and P. aeruginosa species-specific primers (PA-31. PA-33. PA-34). The crude biosurfactant extracted from one of these five isolates was identified as glycolipid class of biosurfactant which exhibited 83.33% inhibition of Phytophthora infestans growth at 100 ppm concentration when tested in-vitro using poisoned food technique.,True,R3221T8AAAAJ:HJSXoJQnj-YC,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehi_Lal2/publication/287552822_Identification_of_pseudomonas_aeruginosa_strain_producing_biosurfactant_with_antifungal_activity_against_phytophthora_infestans/links/56d82f7e08aebe4638b34343/Identification-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-strain-producing-biosurfactant-with-antifungal-activity-against-phytophthora-infestans.pdf,8959433547334643886,/scholar?cites=8959433547334643886,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehi_Lal2/publication/287552822_Identification_of_pseudomonas_aeruginosa_strain_producing_biosurfactant_with_antifungal_activity_against_phytophthora_infestans/links/56d82f7e08aebe4638b34343/Identification-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-strain-producing-biosurfactant-with-antifungal-activity-against-phytophthora-infestans.pdf,0,0,0

The pathogen is polycyclic in nature and completes many cycles in a crop season. Management strategies for its effective control include use of host resistance. chemicals. forecasting. sanitation and even disease escape (2. 10). Although the best strategies to combat this menace is to breed for host resistance. yet the experience so far has shown that resistance in potato varieties break down within a decade. Therefore. only suitable alternative left over is use of fungicides. However. the pathogen has shown a remarkable capacity for change with respect to host genotype and fungicides. As a result. disease control requires regular application of fungicides at high rates and short intervals throughout the growing season. It is therefore. important to enhance host resistance with fungicides. The use of cultivars with durable resistance combined with scheduled applications of protective fungicides has been reported as useful for managing late blight. as well as for other diseases. Regarding effectiveness of mixture of fungicides and their rotation strategies. experimental data are limited (4).

1151104,Management of Late Blight of Potato,2018,Mehi Lal and Sanjeev Sharma and Saurabh Yadav and Santosh Kumar,,Potato-From Incas to All Over the World,,,IntechOpen,Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important crop and Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary is the oomycete. which was responsible for infamous Irish potato famine during 1843–45 and it continues to cause worldwide devastation of the potato. Moreover. this disease is re-emerging in the forms of different genotypes and causes huge yield loss in the potato crop. The factors which are responsible for huge yield loss of potato are applied improper management strategies and pathogen behavior. Management strategies includes; forecasting. cultural. biological. varietal and chemical management. Forecasting is the better option for management of late blight. if accurately forecasted and promptly information reaches to the end users. As infected potato tubers cause the primary sources of infection in next season. The cultural practices will also helpful in reducing inoculum load and managing the disease. The host resistance is best option for management of this disease. However. due to very divers’ virulence nature of P. infestans; the resistance of the varieties is wiped out within a decade. Several fungicides including contact. systemic and translaminar have been evaluated from time to time; however. the pathogen has shown a remarkable capacity for change with respect to host genotype and fungicides.

Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn is a soil borne pathogen causing web blight every year in varying intensity and causes heavy reduction in yield. It is considered one of the important causes for stagnated productivity of urdbean in the country (Dubey and Patel. 2001). The disease appeared about 21-25 days after sowing. depending upon rainfall. relative humidity and temperature. Yield losses due to this disease are estimated up to 20-30% depending on cultivars. environmental conditions. crop stages at which the disease appears and cultivation practices (Shailbala and Tripathi. 2007). Control of the diseases caused by R. solani is difficult because of it have saprophytic and parasitic properties. especially subgroups of AG 1 and AG 2. because it has an extremely wide host range (Ogoshi. 1996). There are currently 13 anastomosis groups (AGs) of R. solani (Carling et al.. 2003). The first symptom appears as small circular brown spot on the leaf lets. These spots enlarge often show concentric banding and become surrounded by irregular shaped water soaked areas. The mycelium on infected leaves appear as spider web thus the name given as web blight disease. Under favourable conditions. sclerotia germinate and the growing mycelial on the soil surface (extension to 10 cm) penetrates through healthy or damaged tissue of lower leaves. Sclerotia consist of loosely constructed knots of melanised hyphae. with no cellular differentiation (Webster. 1980).

Pulses are valued for their high protein content and protein quality and thus. supplement the cereal based diets. The protein content of most pulses ranges from 17-24 per cent which is almost 2-3 times more than that found in cereals. Pulses play an important role in the food and farming economy of our country. Lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.) is one of the oldest known protein-rich food legumes grown in India. It is cultivated throughout Northern and Central India. It is one of the oldest crops that originated in near east and Mediterranean region. Masur or lentil is a bushy. annual shrub plant that is popular for its lens shaped seeds. which are consumed as food in stew or other forms all over the world. These seeds have a vast range of colors from yellow to red-orange to green. brown and black and also have second highest levels of proteins and fiber after soybeans. The area under lentil in India is around 1.59 m. ha with a production of 0.94 m. t and productivity 697 Kg/ha (Anonymous. 2011). Lentil seed has a relatively higher protein. carbohydrates and calories compared to other legumes and its high average protein content and fast cooking characteristics make this crop as the most desired in many lentil producing regions (Muehlbauer et al.. 1985). Owing to biotic and abiotic stresses. the crop yield is below attainable levels. Among the biotic factors. diseases are serious threat to lentil production.

A piecewise-smooth surface model for image data that possesses surface coherence properties is used to develop an algorithm that simultaneously segments a large class of images into regions of arbitrary shape and approximates image data with bivariate functions so that it is possible to compute a complete. noiseless image reconstruction based on the extracted functions and regions. Surface curvature sign labeling provides an initial coarse image segmentation. which is refined by an iterative region-growing method based on variable-order surface fitting.

Systems are beginning to emerge in both the research and commercial sectors based on 'content-based' image retrieval. a technique which explicitly manages image assets by directly representing their visual attributes. The Virage image search engine provides an open framework for building such systems. The Virage engine expresses visual features as image 'primitives.' Primitives can be very general (such as color. shape. or texture) or quite domain specific (face recognition. cancer cell detection. etc.). The basic philosophy underlying this architecture is a transformation from the data-rich representation of explicit image pixels to a compact. semantic-rich representation of visually salient characteristics.

Before database issues can be addressed. it is necessary to give a definition of similarity as an operation.

The most attractive feature of range images is the explicitness of the surface information. Many industrial and navigational robotic tasks will be more easily accomplished if such explicit depth information can be efficiently obtained and interpreted. Intensity image understanding research has shown that the early processing of sensor data should be data-driven. The goal of early processing is to generate a rich description for later processing. Classical differential geometry provides a complete local description of smooth surfaces. The first and second fundamental forms of surfaces provide a set of differential-geometric shape descriptors that capture domain-independent surface information.

Most research for establishing correspondence uses only two frames of a sequence to solve this problem. By using a sequence of frames. it is possible to exploit the fact that due to inertia the motion of an object cannot change instantaneously. By using smoothness of motion. it is possible to solve the correspondence problem for arbitrary motion of several nonrigid objects in a scene.

1151145,A robust backpropagation learning algorithm for function approximation,1994,David S Chen and Ramesh C Jain,5,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,3,467-479,IEEE,The backpropagation (BP) algorithm allows multilayer feedforward neural networks to learn input-output mappings from training samples. Due to the nonlinear modeling power of such networks. the learned mapping may interpolate all the training points. When erroneous training data are employed. the learned mapping can oscillate badly between data points. In this paper we derive a robust BP learning algorithm that is resistant to the noise effects and is capable of rejecting gross errors during the approximation process. The spirit of this algorithm comes from the pioneering work in robust statistics by Huber and Hampel. Our work is different from that of M-estimators in two aspects: 1) the shape of the objective function changes with the iteration time; and 2) the parametric form of the functional approximator is a nonlinear cascade of affine transformations.

Therefore. the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop “sensor based” approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g.. weather. time of day. previous consumption).

Rice is one of the major food sources for many regions of the world especially in monsoon Asia and accounts for more than 11% of the global cropland. Accurate. on-time and early information on spatial distribution of rice would be useful for stakeholders (cultivators. fertilizer/pesticide manufacturers and agriculture extension agencies) to effectively plan supply of inputs. market activities. Also. government agencies can plan and formulate policies regarding food security. Conventional methods involves manual surveying for developing spatio-temporal crop datasets while remote sensing satellite observations provide cost effective alternatives with better spatial extent and temporal frequency. Remote sensing is one of the effective technologies to map the areal extent of the crops using optical as well as microwave/Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) sensors.

Pests and diseases remain a major threat and a large fraction of crops are lost each year due to them. Automated detection of crop health from images helps in taking timely actions to increase yield while helping reduce input cost. With an aim to detect crop diseases and pests with high confidence. we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and boosting techniques on Corn leaf images in different health states. The queen of cereals. Corn. is a versatile crop that has adapted to various climatic conditions. It is one of the major food crops in India along with wheat and rice. Considering that different diseases might have different treatments. incorrect detection can lead to incorrect remedial measures. Although CNN based models have been used for classification tasks. we aim to classify similar looking disease manifestations with a higher accuracy compared to the one obtained by existing deep learning methods. We have evaluated ensembles of CNN based image features. with a classifier and boosting in order to achieve plant disease classification. Using an ensemble of Adaptive Boosting cascaded with a decision tree based classifier trained on features from CNN. we have achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying the Corn leaf images into four different categories viz.

Cham, Ethical value exchange is moving to the forefront of the global challenges that HCI will have to address in the coming years. We argue that applying a context-sensitive. socio-technical approach to HCI can help meet this challenge. The background is that the life of marginalized people in contemporary society is challenging and uncertain. The marginalized can face health and cognitive issues as well as a lack of stability in social structures such as family. work and social inclusion. Three questions are of concern when innovating together with people ‘at the margins’: how can we describe users without stereotyping badly. what socio-technical HCI methods fit the local context. and how to make the design sustainable in the face of current planetary challenges (e.g.. climate change)? We discuss a socio-technical HCI approach called human work interaction design (HWID) to meet the challenges of designing …,True,bhSXOcsAAAAJ:GnPB-g6toBAC,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19115-3_19,,,,https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/217457668/AlibaugFishersAndHWID_ICT4D2019_AuthorVersion.pdf,0,0,0

It is a complex data-intensive process and requires the animal breeder to maintain 7–10 forms having 230 data fields. Each data field may have 5–100 options to be filled in. which is a challenging task to be done on a small screen mobile phone by low-literate breeder. We followed an iterative design process to improve the overall user experience. We interacted with the end users. understood their environment. and analyzed the existing methods. We analyzed all the forms and data recorded by them in last 3 years. We analyzed major parameters like cattle species. pregnancy stages. cattle locations. etc.. and based on the unique combination of these values. we defined various “contexts”. For every context and data field. we identified “context-sensitive” vocabulary (word library) extracted from the available records. So. for the selected data field. we recommended the values based on the context. from the vocabulary.

Cham,The elderly population is steadily increasing in most countries due to a decline in birth and mortality rate. The population of independently living senior citizens has also become significant. This has led to an active research focus in geriatric wellness. Apart from the usual physical and cognitive decline that proceeds with age. there are much softer aspects like dignity and ability to live independently (age-in-place). If we monitor the subject all the time by instrumenting them heavily. technology can possibly predict and prevent many abnormal situations. However. this curbs the idea of independent living. Hence. while instrumenting and monitoring is an important paradigm in Ambient Assisted Living (AAL). the need for the underlying technology to be non-intrusive or as natural as possible is also pressing.

In this paper. a security mechanism is proposed to defend against a cooperative gray hole attack on the well known AODV routing protocol in MANETs. A gray hole is a node that selectively drops and forwards data packets after it advertises itself as having the shortest path to the destination node in response to a route request message from a source node. The proposed mechanism does not apply any cryptographic primitives on the routing messages. Instead. it protects the network by detecting and reacting to malicious activities of any node.

1151241,Resource constrained offloading in fog computing,2016,Ajay Kattepur and Harshit Dohare and Visali Mushunuri and Hemant Kumar Rath and Anantha Simha,,,,1-6,,When focusing on the Internet of Things (IoT). communicating and coordinating sensor--actuator data via the cloud involves inefficient overheads and reduces autonomous behavior. The Fog Computing paradigm essentially moves the compute nodes closer to sensing entities by exploiting peers and intermediary network devices. This reduces centralized communication with the cloud and entails increased coordination between sensing entities and (possibly available) smart network gateway devices. In this paper. we analyze the utility of offloading computation among peers when working in fog based deployments. It is important to study the trade-offs involved with such computation offloading. as we deal with resource (energy. computation capacity) limited devices. Devices computing in a distributed environment may choose to locally compute part of their data and communicate the remainder to their peers.

Our schemes adapt the transmission rates between subscriber stations (SSs) and the base station (BS) dynamically using adaptive modulation. We ensure fairness among the SSs via a credit-based approach in which an SS that misses a chance to transmit due to bad channel gets more weightage when the channel favors scheduling. We also propose a method to compute an optimal polling interval that aims to maximize slot utilization and TCP throughput. We demonstrate through exhaustive simulations that the proposed schedulers maximize link utilization. provide long-term fairness and minimize contraction of TCP congestion window.

Caching is an important and integral part of ICN. In ICN. the requested contents that are downloaded from the original source are stored at intermediate on-path routers. With increase in similarity in the requests by multiple users. similarity of contents passing through edge routers increases. This leads to cache redundancy at the edge routers resulting in decrease in network performance. To improve the network performance in such kind of scenarios. we have proposed a co-operative caching policy in which the edge routers or on-path routers optimally store the requested ICN contents and are supported by a strategically placed central off-path cache router for additional level of caching.

Caching is an important and integral part of ICN. In ICN. the requested contents that are downloaded from the original source are stored at intermediate on-path routers. With increase in similarity in the requests by multiple users. similarity of contents passing through edge routers increases. This leads to cache redundancy at the edge routers resulting in decrease in network performance. To improve the network performance in such kind of scenarios. we have proposed a co-operative caching policy in which the edge routers or on-path routers optimally store the requested ICN contents and are supported by a strategically placed central off-path cache router for additional level of caching.

Our proposed technique is a simple and low-complexity solution which runs in real-time. This can be implemented as an optimization engine at each SDN controller. The optimization engine at each controller computes a payoff function and compares its own payoff value with that of neighbors and takes appropriate decisions such that either new controllers should be added. or existing controllers should be deleted or offloading should be performed between controllers dynamically.

Caching is an important and integral part of ICN. In ICN. the requested contents that are downloaded from the original source are stored at intermediate on-path routers. With increase in similarity in the requests by multiple users. similarity of contents passing through edge routers increases. This leads to cache redundancy at the edge routers resulting in decrease in network performance. To improve the network performance in such kind of scenarios. we have proposed a co-operative caching policy in which the edge routers or on-path routers optimally store the requested ICN contents and are supported by a strategically placed central off-path cache router for additional level of caching.

Many recent imaging modalities in medicine. such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). computed tomography (CT).  digital mammography also generate images directly in digital form. These technologies have greatly increased knowledge of normal and diseased anatomy for medical research and are a critical component  in diagnosis and treatment planning. With the increasing size and number of medical images. the use of computers in facilitating their processing and analysis has become necessary. Estimation of the volume of the whole organ. parts of the organ and/or objects within an organ i.e. tumors is clinically important in the analysis of medical  image. The relative change in size. shape and the spatial relationships between anatomical structures obtained from intensity distributions provide important information in clinical diagnosis for monitoring disease progression for the radiologist. In particular. computer algorithms for the delineation of anatomical  structures and other regions of interest are a key component in assisting and automating specific radiological tasks.

Multiple constraints are imposed on intermediate relay node selection and source to destination path selection. The relay node constraints for routing protocol design are cooperation. interference caused to other nodes and sufficient neighborhood connectivity. Path constraints for routing are end-to-end throughput and end-to-end delay. We do not assume full cooperation for call forwarding and present a facile incentive mechanism to motivate the cooperation for call forwarding. We incorporate a realistic mobility model and dynamic call dropping notion in our system. Flat fading i.i.d Rayleigh channel is assumed between mobile nodes.

In this proposed architecture each node in the system has a trust and provenance vector. Each information item transmitted over the network has a trust value associated with it.

Pests and diseases remain a major threat and a large fraction of crops are lost each year due to them. Automated detection of crop health from images helps in taking timely actions to increase yield while helping reduce input cost. With an aim to detect crop diseases and pests with high confidence. we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) and boosting techniques on Corn leaf images in different health states. The queen of cereals. Corn. is a versatile crop that has adapted to various climatic conditions. It is one of the major food crops in India along with wheat and rice. Considering that different diseases might have different treatments. incorrect detection can lead to incorrect remedial measures. Although CNN based models have been used for classification tasks. we aim to classify similar looking disease manifestations with a higher accuracy compared to the one obtained by existing deep learning methods. We have evaluated ensembles of CNN based image features. with a classifier and boosting in order to achieve plant disease classification. Using an ensemble of Adaptive Boosting cascaded with a decision tree based classifier trained on features from CNN. we have achieved an accuracy of 98% in classifying the Corn leaf images into four different categories viz.

1151387,Location estimation with reactive routing in resource constrained sensor networks,2010,Sanat Sarangi and Subrat Kar,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1009.4898,,,,Routing algorithms for wireless sensor networks can be broadly divided into two classes-proactive and reactive. Proactive routing is suitable for a network with a fixed topology. On the other hand. reactive routing is more suitable for a set of mobile nodes where routes are created on demand and there is not much time to evaluate the worthiness of a route. the prime concern being reachability due to constantly changing node positions. Sensor networks route events of interest from source (s) to destination (s) where appropriate actions could be taken. However. with mobile sensor nodes. it is not only important to know the events but the location of the nodes generating the events. Most sensor nodes are not equipped with expensive GPS or accurate RSSI computation hardware to aid localization. Keeping these in view. we propose a modified reactive routing algorithm. with added support for localization. to localize mobile sensor nodes on the basis of information received from fixed sensor nodes during mutual exchange of routing control packets. The accuracy of localization depends on the ratio of the number of fixed nodes to the number of mobile nodes and the topology of the fixed nodes. A typical application scenario would be a mix of mobile nodes and fixed nodes. where fixed nodes know their absolute location and the location of mobile nodes is derived from the fixed nodes. in step with the reactive routing protocol in action. The modified algorithm would be suitable for deployments where the approximate position of a mobile node (ie the event location) is required but there is no external support infrastructure available for localization.,True,hX4k4ikAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4898,13661489652308439853,/scholar?cites=13661489652308439853,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.4898,0,0,0

We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face. under varying illumination but fixed pose. lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However. since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing. images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation. we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation.

Our approach relies on an existing methodology for expressing signal processing and control circuits as biomolecular reactions. We first extend the methodology so that circuits can be expressed using just two classes of reactions: catalysis and annihilation. We then propose implementations of these reactions in three distinct classes of nucleic acid circuits. which rely on DNA strand displacement. DNA enzyme and RNA enzyme mechanisms. respectively. We use these implementations to design a Proportional Integral controller. capable of regulating the output of a system according to a given reference signal …,True,9NACq1MAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,77,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/sb400169s,15079702610526305698,/scholar?cites=15079702610526305698,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/sb400169s,0,0,0

Tape tension ripples are caused by reel eccentricities that produce disturbances with time-varying frequencies. In both designs. the frequency and the magnitude of the disturbance are estimated to synthesize an input signal to cancel the disturbance. In the first design. by adjusting the values of the adaptive parameters that are related to the frequency of the disturbance. the estimated frequency reflects the time-varying nature of the disturbance.

Gal3p. Gal80p. and Gal4p determine the transcriptional status of the genes required for the galactose utilization. Increase in the cellular galactose concentration causes the galactose molecules to bind onto Gal3p which. via Gal80p. activates Gal4p. which induces the GAL3 and GAL80 gene transcription. Recently. a linear time-invariant multi-input multi-output (MIMO) model of this GAL regulatory network has been proposed; the inputs being galactose and Gal4p. and the outputs being the active Gal4p and galactose utilization. Unfortunately. this model assumes the cell culture to be homogeneous. although it is not so in practice. We overcome this drawback by including more biochemical reactions. and derive a quadratic ordinary differential equation (ODE) based model. We show that the model. referred to above. does not exhibit bistability. We establish sufficiency conditions for the domain of attraction of an equilibrium point of our ODE model for the special case of full-state feedback controller. We observe that the GAL regulatory system of Kluyveromyces lactis exhibits an aberration of monotone nonlinearity and apply the Rantzer multipliers to establish a class of stabilizing controllers for this system. Feedback in a GAL regulatory system can be used to enhance the cellular memory.

Although membrane bioreactors (MBAs) have been studied for anaerobic wastewater treatment. sulfidogenic anaerobic MBAs (AnMBRs) received little or no attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of sulfate-reducing AnMBR and investigate the membrane foulants and filtration characteristics. Sulfate reduction and COD oxidation efficiencies exceeded 90% when the reactor was fed with a synthetic sulfate-rich (2000 mg/L) wastewater with COD/sulfate ratio of 0.75. Long-term filtration performance was evaluated using several filterability tests. Deposition of high molecular weight soluble organics and S. Si. Fe. Cu. Na. and Mg were detected in the cake layer. The formation of metal-sulfide precipitates was the main reason for heavy metal deposition on the membrane surface. Desulfovibrio-like sulfate reducing bacteria was detected in the bioreactor.

Then. four ball tests were performed by adding 1% H2SO4 to four kinds of gas engine oils. As a result of the tests. it has been determined that H2S in the content of biogas has adverse effects on lubrication. Oils that have lost their lubrication feature have been found to increase the wear on metal parts by 50-70% on average. In addition to these results. copper rod test was carried out on the same oil samples. Monthly H2S values were followed in a biogas plant used in energy production from waste. Changes in turbocharged bearings were observed after using of variable H2S ratio of 750 and 1500 hours. These changes were compared with field studies in the literature.

As these reaction rates depend primarily on the thermodynamic properties of the reactants and the corresponding transition state. this work attempts to predict these properties within the framework of group additivity.

In POX. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are important undesired byproducts. To improve the productivity of such POX processes. it is necessary to have an accurate chemical mechanism for methane-rich combustion including PAH. A new mechanism was created to capture the chemistry from C0 to C12. incorporating new information derived from recent quantum chemistry calculations. with help from the Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software. For better estimation of kinetics and thermochemistry of aromatic species. including reactions through carbene intermediates. new reaction families and additional data from quantum chemistry calculations were added to RMG-database. Many of the rate coefficients in the new mechanism are significantly pressure-dependent at POX conditions. The new mechanism was validated against electron-ionization molecular beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS) data from a high-temperature flow reactor reported by Kohler et al. In this work quantification of additional species from those experiments is reported including phenylacetylene (C8H6). indene (C9H8). naphthalene (C10H8) and acenaphthylene (C12H8) at many temperatures for several feed compositions.

1151616,Measuring rate constants and product branching for reactions relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistry,2018,Zachary James Buras,,,,,,Over the last century there have been countless experimental measurements of the overall reaction kinetics of gas-phase radicals. often with the aid of lasers. In more recent decades. ab initio predictions of product branching using quantum chemical calculations combined with modem rate theories have become common. However. there are few experimental measurements against which to validate predicted product branching. even for an important reaction system such as hydroxyl radical addition to acetylene that is critical to oxidation chemistry both in the atmosphere and in combustion. As a result. many of the kinetic parameters that appear in commonly used combustion mechanisms are based purely on predictions. The few experiments that do attempt to quantify product branching generally fall into two categories. each with unique advantages/disadvantages: crossed molecular beams (CMB) that simulate single collision conditions. or end-product analysis of a complex. thermalized process. such as pyrolysis. Laser flash photolysis (LFP) with molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) offers a compromise between CMB and end-product experiments: the reaction conditions are thermalized but still simple enough that primary products can be quantified with confidence. This thesis describes a unique apparatus. and the improvements made to it. that combines LFP and MBMS for primary product branching quantification. as well as multiple-pass laser absorbance spectrometry (LAS) for accurate measurements of overall kinetics. The full capability of this LFP/MBMS/LAS apparatus is demonstrated for the chemically interesting phenyl radical …,True,7S_2kHAAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/117862,,,,,0,0,0

1151618,Kinetics and Products of Vinyl+ 1. 3-Butadiene. a Potential Route to Benzene,2015,Guozhu Liu and Rehab MI Elsamra and Zachary Buras and Enoch E Dames and Shamel S Merchant and William H Green,,,,,American Chemical Society (ACS),The reaction between vinyl radical. C2H3. and 1.3-butadiene. 1.3-C4H6. has long been recognized as a potential route to benzene. particularly in 1.3-butadiene flames. but the lack of reliable rate coefficients has hindered assessments of its true contribution. Using laser flash photolysis and visible laser absorbance (λ = 423.2 nm). we measured the overall rate coefficient for C2H3 + 1.3-C4H6. k1. at 297 K ≤ T ≤ 494 K and 4 ≤ P ≤ 100 Torr. k1 was in the high-pressure limit in this range and could be fit by the simple Arrhenius expression k1 = (1.1 ± 0.2) × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 exp(−9.9 ± 0.6 kJ mol–1/RT). Using photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. we also investigated the products formed. At T ≤ 494 K and P = 25 Torr. we found only C6H9 adduct species. while at 494 K ≤ T ≤ 700 K and P = 4 Torr. we observed ≤∼10% branching to cyclohexadiene in addition to C6H9. Quantum chemistry master-equation calculations using the modified strong collision model indicate that n-C6H9 is the dominant product at low temperature. consistent with our experimental results. and predict the rate coefficient and branching ratios at higher T where chemically activated channels become important. Predictions of k1 are in close agreement with our experimental results. allowing us to recommend the following modified Arrhenius expression in the high-pressure limit from 300 to 2000 K: k1 = 6.5 × 10–20 cm3 molecule–1 s–1 T2.40 exp(−1.76 kJ mol–1/RT).,True,7S_2kHAAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/108286,,,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/108286/Green_Kinetics%20and%20products.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

The proposed technique is classified as an active island detection technique and it is based on the voltage change at the point of common coupling (PCC) that occurs in islanding. To avoid island detection failure in case of a close matching between IBDG-generated power and load power. an active power–voltage locus is introduced to shift the reference active power for PCC voltage change. therefore breaking the IBDG-load power balance and transferring the operating point outside the non-detection zone. A new harmonic performance index. named harmonic amplification factor. is introduced to detect the island. This factor amplifies each harmonic component by its order.

One of their serious drawbacks is their vulnerable nature to dc-side faults. since the freewheeling diodes act as a rectifier bridge and feed the dc faults. The severity of dc-side faults can be limited by connecting double thyristor switches across the semiconductor devices. By turning them on. the ac current contribution into the dc side is eliminated and the dc-link current will freely decay to zero. The main disadvantages of this method are: high dv/dt stresses across thyristors during normal conditions. and the absence of bypassing for the freewheeling diodes during dc faults since they are sharing the fault current with thyristors.

The penetration of PV systems as distributed generators in low-voltage grids has also seen significant attention. In addition. the need for higher overall grid efficiency and reliability has boosted the interest in the microgrid concept. High-efficiency PV-based microgrids require maximum power point tracking (MPPT) controllers to maximize the harvested energy due to the nonlinearity in PV module characteristics.

1151714,Detection of rotor slot and other eccentricity related harmonics in a three phase induction motor with different rotor cages,2001,Subhasis Nandi and Shehab Ahmed and Hamid A Toliyat,16,IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion,3,253-260,IEEE,Detection of rotor slot and other eccentricity related harmonics in the line current of a three phase induction motor is important both from the viewpoint of sensorless speed estimation as well as eccentricity related fault detection. However. it is now clear that not all three phase induction motors are capable of generating such harmonics in the line current. Recent research has shown that the presence of these harmonics is primarily dependent on the number of rotor slots and the number of fundamental pole pairs of the machine. While the number of fundamental pole pairs of a three phase induction motor usually is within one to four (higher pole pairs are generally avoided due to increased magnetizing current). the number of rotor slots can vary widely. The present paper investigates this phenomenon further and obtains a hitherto nebulous theoretical basis for the experimentally verified results.

The absence of manufacturing and operational standards has led to many point-to-point HVDC links built at different voltage levels. which creates another challenge. Therefore. the issues of voltage matching and dc fault isolation are undergoing extensive research and are addressed in this paper. A quasi two-level operating mode of the modular multilevel converter is proposed. where the converter generates a square wave with controllable dv/dt by employing the cell voltages to create transient intermediate voltage levels.

These conversions are normally made using bulky. complex. and costly transformers and high-voltage ac-dc converters with unnecessary bidirectional power flow capability. Multiple modules of single-switch single-inductor dc-dc converters can reach high gains without transformers in these applications due to low semiconductor conduction loss in high-power devices.

One of their serious drawbacks is their vulnerable nature to dc-side faults. since the freewheeling diodes act as a rectifier bridge and feed the dc faults. The severity of dc-side faults can be limited by connecting double thyristor switches across the semiconductor devices. By turning them on. the ac current contribution into the dc side is eliminated and the dc-link current will freely decay to zero. The main disadvantages of this method are: high dv/dt stresses across thyristors during normal conditions. and the absence of bypassing for the freewheeling diodes during dc faults since they are sharing the fault current with thyristors.

1151735,A new multilevel converter for megawatt scale solar photovoltaic utility integration,2012,HS Krishnamoorthy and S Essakiappan and PN Enjeti and RS Balog and S Ahmed,,,,1431-1438,IEEE,This paper presents a new multi-level DC-AC-AC converter topology for medium voltage grid integration of Megawatt (MW) scale utility photovoltaic (PV) plants. It is envisioned that a large PV field is divided into many zones. each comprising of two PV arrays. The number of zones depends on the voltage of the grid with which it is interfaced. In the proposed approach. zonal power balancing is achieved by employing a current-sharing technique. The power conversion architecture consists of an IGBT based full-bridge inverter feeding a medium frequency (MF) transformer with three secondary windings. The voltages at the transformer secondaries are then converted to three phase line frequency AC by three. full-bridge AC-AC converters. This also eliminates the 2 nd  harmonic power from the DC bus. thereby reducing the capacitor size. By stacking several such modules in series. a high quality multilevel medium …,True,eOzpYdcAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,53,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6166008/,8814670136946204989,/scholar?cites=8814670136946204989,,,0,0,0

Small gas bubbles can be formed in transformer insulation system due to aging problems. previous partial discharges (PD). or imperfect manufacturing process. The electric field strength inside the cavity is high compared to the surrounding insulation material when high voltage is applied. Because of the high electric field strength in the cavity and its low dielectric strength. PD activities take a place inside the insulation system due to this cavity. These PD activities will degrade the insulation system over the time and finally a breakdown can occur. PD characteristics in the presence of cavities in the oil-paper insulation system have been not fully studied especially when HVDC is applied.

These conditions give rise to the danger of leakage currents forming on contaminated or wetted surfaces and finally leading to insulation degradation and failure. Thus. outdoor insulation materials not only have to withstand the electric stress during service. but also they must be resistant against ageing phenomena by dust or humidity. The polymeric insulators were widely used in the last decades because of high contamination resistance. lightweight. mechanical strength and hydrophobicity of their surfaces. The electric stress in the presence of water droplets provokes partial discharges giving way to local reduction of hydrophobicity of insulator surfaces.

It has been applied all over the world for bulk power transmission over long distances with low amount of losses. It is also applied in order to transmit power through submarine cables and to interconnect two asynchronous systems. The converter transformer can be considered as one of the most important components of HVDC transmission system. The durability of the converter transformer insulation system is one of the main concerns for electric power utilities all over the world in the present time. As a result of the wide increase in converter transformer usage. it is very important to make its insulation system as reliable as possible. Small gas bubbles can be formed in transformer insulation system due to aging problems. previous partial discharges (PD). or imperfect manufacturing process. The electric field strength inside the cavity is high compared to the surrounding insulation material when high voltage is applied. Because of the high electric field strength in the cavity and its low dielectric strength. PD activities take a place inside the insulation system due to this cavity. These PD activities will degrade the insulation system over the time and finally a breakdown can occur.

Partial discharge (PD) activities take place when a localized breakdown occurs inside this embedded void. These PD activities degrade the healthy parts of the surrounding insulating papers and a complete breakdown can take place. Thus. it is important to define the main features of PD activities that occur as a result of a small void embedded between oil impregnated papers in order to distinguish such a defect under the operating conditions in the early stages before the whole insulation failure.

1151778,Internal Discharges in Cavities in Solid Dielectric Materials,2012,R.A.A. Abd El-Aal A. A. Hossam-Eldin,,,,AP LAMBERT Academic publishing GmbH& co.,,Internal discharges in cavities in solid dielectrics lead to the degradation. deterioration and complete failure of insulating materials. This would shorten the life time of the electrical equipments. This may affect the reliability of the power supply. A new technique for detecting and measuring internal discharges in cavities in solid dielectrics under alternating voltage conditions has been developed by using an Electrical research association detector (ERA detector model 5) and a multi channel pulse height analyzer. The system was calibrated by feeding voltage pulses of known magnitude into the circuit from a pulse function generator. The technique enabled the study of the magnitude and the repetition rate. of discharges in artificial air filled cavities in polythene samples. The loss tangent was measured using a HV Schering Bridge. The inception and extinction voltages for samples were determined before each experiment. The measurements were compared and showed a high consisted. The results obtained showed that for all cavity locations the discharge inception and extinction voltages decreased as the cavity area was increased. this was found in both cylindrical and spherical cavities. Again this can be attributed to the increase in the number of discharging sites on the surfaces of the cavity. In polythene a sample with cavity facing the high voltage electrode the discharges behaved in a different manner from that facing earthed electrode. The general theme that the repetition rate and magnitude of discharges decrease with the time of voltage application. this is due to the semi conducting deposits accumulated on the cavity surfaces.,True,XRHqdOkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raabd_El-Aal/publication/313938887_Internal_Discharges_in_Cavities_in_Solid_Dielectric_Materials/links/5d4f50004585153e594c4f79/Internal-Discharges-in-Cavities-in-Solid-Dielectric-Materials.pdf,17900933402427010920,/scholar?cites=17900933402427010920,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raabd_El-Aal/publication/313938887_Internal_Discharges_in_Cavities_in_Solid_Dielectric_Materials/links/5d4f50004585153e594c4f79/Internal-Discharges-in-Cavities-in-Solid-Dielectric-Materials.pdf,0,0,0

The presence of a gas cavity between impregnated papers layer is a serious problem. When localized breakdown takes place within this cavity. partial discharge (PD) occurs and ages the rest of the insulation system. This aging phenomenon declines the expected life time of the insulation system and subsequently the life time of the power transformers. Dissolved gas analysis is a recommended technique that is used in order to assess the state of the insulation system inside the transformers. In this paper.

Underground cable accessories. used in medium voltage cable systems. need a stress control tube in order to maintain and control the insulation level which is designed for long life times. The term “electrical stress control” refers to the cable termination analysis of optimizing the electrical stress in the area of insulation shield cutback to reduce the electrical field concentration at this point in order to reduce breakdown in the cable insulation. This paper presents the effect of some materials of different relative permittivities and geometrical regulation with the curved shape stress relief cones on the electric field distribution of cable termination. The optimization was done by comparing the results of eight materials used. Also. the effect of the change in the thickness of the stress control tube is presented.

Joints are the main accessories of the power cables. They are necessary to make connections between lines. The design of a cable joint mostly depends on the cable type. the applied voltage and the cores. These factors add to the way of how electric field stress is distributed at the cable joint. This paper presents a numerical analysis study to the stress control layering electric field distribution within a cable joint. In this paper. a 2D Finite Element Method (FEM) is used. A developed program using FEM has been used to simulate the electric field distribution in the joint of a single core crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) underground medium voltage cable. as well as to investigate the presence of the defects and water droplets in the joint.Many factors such as: the defect size and location. insulation material dielectric constant. insulation thickness. as well as the cavity dimensions. shapes (cylindrical or spherical) and number (one to three either in horizontal or in vertical formation) have been investigated. Also. the electric field in water droplet having different shapes (spherical. hemispherical and cylindrical) is presented. The electric field at this region is increases the electrical discharges at the defect sites. In turn the breakdown occurs when the magnitude of the electric field is larger than the breakdown strength.

1151855,Operating limits and dynamic average-value modelling of VSC-HVDC systems,2012,Mohamed Moustafa,,,,,,This thesis deals with modeling. simulation and operating limits of high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission systems that employ voltage-source converters (VSCs) as their building blocks. This scheme is commonly known as the VSC-HVDC transmission. A simulation-based study is undertaken in which detailed electromagnetic transient (EMT) models are developed for a back-to-back VSC-HVDC transmission system. Different control strategies are implemented and their dynamic performances are investigated in the PSCAD/EMTDC EMT simulator. The research presented in this thesis firstly specifies the factors that limit the operating points of a VSC-HVDC system with particular emphasis on the strength of the terminating ac system. Although the EMT model shows these limits it provides little analytical reason for their presence and extent. A phasor-based quasi-steady state model of the system including the phase-locked loop firing control mechanism is proposed to determine and characterize the factors contributing to these operating limits. Stability margins and limits on the maximum available power are calculated. taking into consideration the maximum voltage rating of the VSC. The variations of ac system short-circuit ratio (SCR) and transformer impedance are proven to significantly impact the operating limits of the VSC-HVDC system. The results show how the power transfer capability reduces as the SCR decreases. The analysis shows that VSC-HVDC converters can operate into much weaker networks. and with less sensitivity. than the conventional line commutated converters (LCC-HVDC).

In hybrid ac-dc microgrids. the control strategy of the interlinking converter allows the distributed generators (DGs) in either microgrid to respond to any load changes in the other microgrid. This load sharing strategy result in a contribution from all DGs to the fault current in either microgrid. Therefore. a new methodology to eliminate the fault current contribution between interlinked hybrid microgrids is proposed in this work.

Faculty of Engineering,The industrial revolution in Egypt and other developing countries need a huge amount of power. while utility could not be able to provide the needed energy and both the cost of energy and environmental issues should be also considered. So. energy saving can be one of the effective solutions to such problems. Demand Side Management (DSM) can be introduced as an effective system management for increasing the efficiency of the grid as it can save energy to both utility and consumer. DSM has different techniques including load shifting strategy that reshapes the load curve to reduce the peak demand and hence the overall total cost.          In this study a granite factory is considered as a case study where the load shifting technique is applied in order to reduce the running cost. The applied optimization technique cost function mainly depends on three main parameters: electrical cost (which is divided into on-peak and off-peak periods). demand cost (depends on the maximum utilized power) and workers’ wages (based on night or day shifts). Two different optimization techniques are applied and compared to get the best optimal results. The first technique is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the second technique is CVX that has been introduced and implemented in MATLAB® 2017 as a guide optimization reference technique.

Recently. the frequency environment of power systems has been made more complicated and the quantity of second harmonic in inrush currents has been decreased because of the improvement of core steel. This will cause the traditional techniques for transformer differential protection more likely to fail.

However this is a difficult problem to handle especially when dealing with multiple errors from the interactive conforming type. In this paper. a self adaptive genetic based algorithm is proposed.

1151958,Simulation of Distance Relay for Load Encroachment Alleviation with Agent Based Supervision of Zone3,2017,Mohamed Badr and Nabil Abassy and Emtethal Abdallah,3,Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development,1,1-11,,Cascaded tripping of power lines due to mal-operation of zone-3 distance relays has been one of the main causes of many previous blackouts worldwide. Encroachment of load into zone-3 characteristics during stressed system operation conditions is a basic factor for such mal-operation of the relays. By improving the operation of zone-3. it is possible to prevent mal-operations so that cascaded line tripping can be avoided. For proper study of the behavior of distance relay during faults and load encroachment phenomenon. we must build a model of distance relay. so in this paper a modeling study of distance relay is implemented using MATLAB/Simulink program. However. this model is distinguished from previous models that. examines in detail the third zone of distance relay. Many cases are simulated with changing line loading and fault location to ensure the capability of the relay to detect the fault and thus the maximum load ability limit of distance relay is obtained. In order to prevent cascading events caused by hidden failures in zone-3 relays. agent based relay architectures have been suggested in the recent past. In such architectures each zone-3 relay contains agents that require communication with other agents at various relevant relays in order to distinguish a real zone-3 event from a temporary overload. In this paper. a local master agent is consulted by all zone-3 agents before a tripping decision is made. The master agent maintains a rule base which is updated based on the local topology of the network and real time monitoring of the status of other relays and circuit breakers.

In photovoltaic (PV) grid connected systems. the major requirement is to achieve maximum output power from the source. Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques require measurements on the DC side of the inverter connected to the PV in order to determine the current operating point on the power characteristics. Typically this is achieved by perturbing the reference output power and observe the change in the PV voltage. current or both. Based on the observation. it could be determined whether the current operating point is beyond or below maximum power. This paper presents an MPPT technique for a single-stage PV grid connected inverter where the MPPT algorithm determines the current operating point at different operating conditions based upon observing the inverter controller action. Such approach eliminates the requirement of sensing elements to be added to the converter which aids the advantages of the single-stage converter. Design of the utilized PV system is derived based on filter parameters. PV panel selection and controller parameters.

Inspection processes are vital in the operation of power systems due to the need for safe and continuous operation [1]. Conventionally. a highlyexperienced representative is required in the analysis process to recommend for suitable solutions. The problems of the predictive inspections in the actual utilization include the increased investment in staff training and ignoring the economical benefits of this process by the management. In addition. there is a problem regarding high investment of purchasing inspection hardware and software. upgrading and calibrating software. setting up a predictive maintenance database. and developing the final report. These problems may discourage the use of such methods [2]. The economic analysis can easily indicate that the possible damage cost is not far away from the expense of the thermal inspections in some cases such as small projects. Hence. the thermal inspection is not recommended in these projects especially when the owner has no confidence on the feasibility of this process. With modern techniques and software. it is possible to avoid the need for highlyexperienced representative to analyze the inspection and extract suitable recommendations. It is required to provide an interface between the infrared “IR” camera and the operator that facilitates the analysis process.

Selim,,,,,,"This study reviews the problem of energy consumption reduction in public buildings in Egypt in the period 2005 up to 2016.The public buildings in Egypt consume around 30% of the total electrical energy. A considerable portion of consumed power is wasted unnecessarily by continuous operation of electrical loads such as fans and lights even without imperative need for these loads especially in public buildings(e.g. Auditoriums.

In this study. a proposed frameworkbased on a low cost smart controlled power saving system is implemented to control the usage of electrical energy. The idea is to use a low cost smart system to control the power input to the lighting and non-emergency equipment in governmental buildings during unworking hours started at 4 PM till 8 AM. The proposed power saving system is designedwith efficient controllers to regulate the on-off operation of electrical devices during the un-work shift from 4 PM to 8 AM ""night guard work-shift"". Two measures are carried out in this shift. which are the total accumulation times during OFF periods and the total accumulation times during ON periods of electrical equipment. The assessment of the proposed system is based on the savings ratios for certain energy consumption.

1152011,Solar driven steam jet ejector chiller,2009,Clemens Pollerberg and Ahmed Hamza H Ali and Christian Dötsch,29,Applied Thermal Engineering,5-6,1245-1252,Pergamon,This paper presents a solar driven process to generate cold water for air-conditioning by parabolic trough collectors and a steam jet ejector chiller. The only working fluid in the system is water. which is used as refrigerant and working fluid. The operational behaviour of such a system has been investigated by a small test rig. The investigation shows that the cooling water temperature as well as the cold water temperature has a strong influence on the coefficient of performance of a steam jet ejector chiller. The coefficient of performance reaches high values in part load and at good re-cooling conditions. so that the mean efficiency is clearly higher than the nominal efficiency of the system.

A ‘double skin facade’is optimally one of the best options in managing the interaction between the outdoors and the internal spaces. It also provides some architectural flexibility to the design. Double skin façade (DSF) building is one of the available energy conservation opportunities through recent intelligent buildings. The need to energy conservation and sustainable development in buildings is causing a new interest towards passive solar systems. This paper will survey the various types of double skin facades systems. exploring their features and functioning followed by a review of examples; both constructed and proposed. from different buildings. The paper will then assess and analyze recent research and examples to attempt to reach a conclusion as to whether with a double skin façade. minimizing energy consumption within building. Finally. double skin facade (DSF) has been proven to be highly useful and significant in current building developments. The only downside of double skin facade is that it is said to be more expensive than the traditional single glass facade. However. it is widely agreed by many experts that double skin facade (DSF) is more cost-effective in the long run.

The thermal modeling has been developed in COMSOL Multiphysics software environment and the electrical modeling has been carried out in PSIM software environment. The main objective of the electrical model is to investigate the IV and PV characteristics of an 80W thin film PV module with and without cooling at varying surface temperature and irradiation. In the thermal model. the dependence of module surface temperature. electrical efficiency. and thermal efficiency on water flow velocity is investigated. The results obtained from the proposed electrical and thermal models are validated experimentally. The results showed that the maximum electrical. thermal and net energy efficiency values of cooled PV module are 9.92%. 55.6%. and 65.4%. respectively.

Electrostatic precipitators are very useful as a means to reduce emissions from heavy industry factories. This paper aims to examine the performance of wire-duct electrostatic precipitators (WDESP) as affected by high-temperature incoming gases with a varying number of discharge wires while increasing their radius. The precipitator performance is expressed in terms of the corona onset voltage on the stressed wires and the corona current–voltage (I–V) characteristic of the precipitators working with incoming gases at high temperatures. The start of the corona onset voltage on the surface of the discharge wires is calculated for the precipitators under high temperatures based on the standard of the self-repeat of avalanches’ electrons developing on the surface of the stressed wires at high temperatures. For this. calculating the electrostatic field in the precipitators with single-and multi-discharge wires due to the stressed wire with the use of the well-known charge simulation method (CSM) with high-temperature incoming gases is important. The modeling of corona I–V characteristics is adopted using the finite element method (FEM) for single-and multi-(3-. 5-. and 7-) discharge wires of WDESP with high-temperature incoming gases. Additionally. the electrostatic field. potential. and space charge of WDESP are calculated by a simultaneous solution of equations of Poisson. current density. and the continuity current density.

Also. an accurate mathematical model was used to estimate the parameters of the PV panel. which is a non-linear optimization problem. Based on the experimental data and using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. the optimal five parameters of a single diode model of a PV panel were determined in this study. This experimental work was conducted and carried out in the Renewable Energy Laboratory of Assiut University. Egypt. A comparative analysis was completed for three identical solar PV panels; the first panel was coated with hydrophobic SiO 2 nanomaterial. so it was considered to be a self-cleaning panel; the second panel was uncoated and cleaned manually on a daily basis; and the third panel was kept dusty all the time through the experimental investigation. and was used as a reference. Experimentally. the output power of the PV panels was monitored for each panel in this study. Also. the anti-static and anti-reflection effects of coating solar PV panels with hydrophobic SiO 2 nanomaterial were investigated experimentally. According to the obtained experimental results. it was found that the use of SiO 2 coating for PV panels results in the better performance of the PV panels.

Extensions to the basic steps of soft sensor design. namely soft sensor performance enhancement and the modifications needed to facilitate different industrial process applications follow in Chapter 7 and 8. respectively. Widening the applications range and role of soft sensors to fault detection and sensor validation configurations is dealt with in Chapter 9. A great strength of Soft Sensors for Monitoring and Control of Industrial Processes is the use. throughout the text. of a set of industrial case studies to demonstrate the successes and drawbacks of the different methods used to create soft sensor models. A number of different methods may be used in each separate step of the soft sensor design process and the industrial case studies are often used to provide explicit comparisons of the performance of these methods. The industrial control and process engineer will find these comparison exercises invaluable illustrations of the sort of results that might be found in industrial applications. The monograph also highlights the importance of using knowledge from industrial experts and from the existing industrial process literature.

The effect of introducing chaotic sequences instead of random ones during all the phases of the evolution process is investigated. The approach is based on the substitution of the random number generator (RNG) with chaotic sequences. Several numerical examples are reported in order to compare the performance of the EA using random and chaotic generators as regards to both the results and the convergence speed. The results obtained show that some chaotic sequences are always able to increase the value of some measured algorithm-performance indexes with respect to random sequences. Moreover. it is shown that EAs can be extremely sensitive to different RNGs.

The structure introduced represents a generalization of the multilayer perceptron in the complex space (CMLP) reported in the literature. The fundamental result reported in the paper is a new density theorem which makes HMLPs universal interpolators of quaternion valued continuous functions.

Recently. the advantages achievable by using combinations of these methods. which have independent origin and evolution. have been pointed out. generating a new paradigm which is now termed"" soft-computing"". This new methodology subsumes the capabilities of neural networks for modelling non-linear systems and for solving classification problems. the power of fuzzy-logic to represent approximate or heuristic reasoning and the large capabilities of evolutionary computation for problem optimisation. The book presents a clear understanding of a new type of computation system. the cellular neural network (CNN). which has been successfully applied to the solution of many heavy computation problems. mainly in the fields of image processing and complex partial differential equations. CNNs' computation-based systems represent new opportunities for improving the soft-computation toolbox.

The instrument was designed with the aim of replacing measuring hardware during maintenance operations. The virtual instrument is based on a nonlinear moving average model. implemented by using multilayer perceptron neural networks. Stacking approaches are adopted to improve the estimation performance of the instrument. Classical linear algorithms of model aggregation are compared in the paper with a nonlinear strategy. based on the neural combination of a set of first-level neural estimators. The validity of the proposed approach is verified by comparison with the performance of both linear and nonlinear modeling techniques.

The system has DC sensing capabilities and is able to work in the range of a few millinewtons. IPMCs are emerging materials used to realize motion actuators and sensors. An IPMC strip is activated in a beam fixed/simply-supported configuration. The beam is tightened at the simply-supported end by a force. This influences the natural resonant frequency of the beam; the value of the resonant frequency is used in the proposed system to estimate the force applied in the axial direction.

The response of IPMC transducers as a function of modifying quantities is a matter of interest; however. it has not been investigated. It is reasonable to argue that environmental humidity and temperature represent the main modifying parameters. In fact. humidity changes the behavior of IPMC transducers. working as both sensors and actuators. because it changes the Young modulus of the devices and. hence. their mechanical response. The influence of temperature is suspected. because polymer characteristics are often influenced by this quantity.

They are interesting materials due to not only their electromechanical applications as transducers but also to their electrochemical features and the relationship between the ionic/solvent current and the potential field. Their electrochemical properties thus suggest the possibility for exploiting them as compact fractional-order elements (FOEs) with a view of defining fabrication processes and production strategies that assure the desired performances.  In this paper. the experimental electrical characterization of a brand new IPMC setup in a fixed sandwich configuration is proposed. Two IPMC devices with different platinum absorption times (5 h and 20 h) are characterized through experimental data: first. a preliminary linearity study is performed for a fixed input voltage amplitude in order to determine the frequency region where IPMC can be approximated as linear; then. a frequency analysis is carried out in order to identify a coherent fractional-order dynamics in the bode diagrams.

Several numerical examples are reported in order to compare the performance of the EA using random and chaotic generators as regards to both the results and the convergence speed. The results obtained show that some chaotic sequences are always able to increase the value of some measured algorithm-performance indexes with respect to random sequences.

1152123,Cellular neural networks: chaos. complexity and VLSI processing,2012,Gabriele Manganaro and Paolo Arena and Luigi Fortuna,1,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,The field of cellular neural networks (CNNs) is of growing importance in non linear circuits and systems and it is maturing to the point of becoming a new area of study in general nonlinear theory. CNNs emerged through two semi nal papers co-authored by Professor Leon O. Chua back in 1988. Since then. the attention that CNNs have attracted in the scientific community has been vast. For instance. there are international workshops dedicated to CNNs and their applications. special issues published in both the International Journal of Circuit Theory and in the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems. and there are also Associate Editors appointed in the latter journal especially for the CNN field. All of this bears witness the importance that CNNs are gaining within the scientific community. Without doubt this book is a primer in the field. Its extensive coverage provides the reader with a very comprehensive view of aspects involved in the theory and applications of cellular neural networks. The authors have done an excellent job merging basic CNN theory. synchronization. spatio temporal phenomena and hardware implementation into eight exquisitely written chapters. Each chapter is thoroughly illustrated with examples and case studies. The result is a book that is not only excellent as a professional reference but also very appealing as a textbook. My view is that students as well professional engineers will find this volume extremely useful.,True,bDYycfQAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,176,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=V9mpCAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:EsSglk4sVykJ:scholar.google.com&ots=2H6yy78Onw&sig=EpnOd5xv1tSes1sVfgErKRvoZWs,2978898394575062034,/scholar?cites=2978898394575062034,,,0,0,0

Such a structure. called hypercomplex multilayer perceptron (HMLP). is developed in quaternion algebra and allows quaternionic input and output signals to be dealt with. requiring a lower number of neurons than the real MLP. thus providing a reduced computational complexity. The structure introduced represents a generalization of the multilayer perceptron in the complex space (CMLP) reported in the literature. The fundamental result reported in the paper is a new density theorem which makes HMLPs universal interpolators of quaternion valued continuous functions. Moreover the proof of the density theorem can be restricted in order to formulate a density theorem in the complex space. Due to the identity between the quaternion and the four-dimensional real space. such a structure is also useful to approximate multidimensional real …,True,bDYycfQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,143,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608096000482,16961470425530006273,/scholar?cites=16961470425530006273,,,0,0,0

In particular. with respect to the previous work in which the procedures to be planned and activated in emergency conditions were defined in order to allow the evacuation of weak users (the disabled. senior citizens. etc.) from the area affected by a disaster. some advanced instruments and scenarios for designing the optimal path for emergency vehicles to reduce evacuation times are introduced. The problem of an emergency vehicle that has to pick up some users at fixed points of the network and to take them to the refuge area is schematized (as in a previous work) with two different approaches: as a shortest-path problem (one to one) and as a vehicle routing problem (many to one).

They are obtained as a combination of spatially disaggregated and aggregated data about simulated traffic conditions on an urban road network. The disaggregated data concern the congested link travel times. which are traditionally used as variable to be minimized in VRP. The novelty of this research article consists in the introduction of spatially aggregated data. which are estimated by means of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). In a within-day dynamic context. they are a measure of reliability of travel times because they could anticipate the latter ones’ variation in the short term.

The problem of an emergency vehicle that has to pick up weak users at fixed points of the network and to take them to the refuge area is schematized with two different approaches: one-to-one and many-to-one. The first regards the minimization of generalized cost of a path that connects an origin to a destination (as a shortest-path problem); the second considers the connection of one origin to many destinations (as a vehicle routing problem). Starting from a brief review of both these problems. the available tools for planning evacuation of weak users in emergency condition in the within of oneto-one and many-to-one are analysed.

The system can be in ordinary or emergency conditions. Path design formulation is based on dynamic programming and its solution is found through a modification of Dijkstra’s algorithm.

In this paper we propose models and procedures for path design. and accordingly for vehicle route design. for a fleet of emergency vehicles that operate to support the population involved in a disaster. When a disaster occurs. the road network changes from ordinary conditions to emergency conditions (ie due to the closure of some links. to the change in link costs. and so on). For a road network under emergency conditions. models and procedures used for networks under ordinary conditions cannot be directly applied [1]. In emergency conditions many of the models and procedures used in ordinary conditions need to be redefined.

Urban goods supply is analysed when the retailer is the decision-maker and chooses to supply his/her shop. Two components are considered: demand in terms of goods supply and vehicle routing with constraints to simulate goods movements. To analyse demand we consider a multi-step model. while to analyse goods movements a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is formalized. We examine the distribution process for a VRPTW in which the optimum paths between all the customers are combined to determine the best vehicle trip chain. As regard optimum path search. a multipath approach is proposed that entails the generation of more than one path between two delivery points.

The classic mesoscopic approach. where packets of users belonging to the same mode move following a path. is modified to take into account multiple modes interacting with each other. simultaneously and on the same multimodal network. In particular. to simulate modal change. functional aspects of multimodal arcs have been developed; those arcs are properly located on the network where modal change occurs and users are packed (or unpacked) in a new modal resource that moves up to destination or to another multimodal arc. A test on a simple network reproducing a real situation is performed in order to show model peculiarities; some indicators. used to describe performances of the considered transport system. are shown.,True,_WUwd7UAAAAJ:IWHjjKOFINEC,5,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2017/8436821/abs/,2799109716232123335,/scholar?cites=2799109716232123335,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jat/2017/8436821/abs/,0,0,0

1152168,The Impact of Dispatchability of Parabolic Trough CSP Plants over PV Power Plants in Palestinian Territories,2019,Aysar Yasin,2019,International Journal of Photoenergy,,14 page,Hindawi,This paper investigates the impacts of dispatchability of Parabolic Trough Concentrated Solar Power (PT-CSP) systems over PV power plants in Palestinian territories. Jericho governorate was taken as a case study. All conditions required for implementing PV and PT-CSP systems are verified. The capacity of each investigated system is 1 MW. and both systems are investigated in terms of technical. economic. and environmental aspects. The parametric analysis is used to identify the most feasible option of each renewable energy system by varying the cost of each option candidate and introducing thermal energy storage (TES) to the technology of PT-CSP systems with different capacities. A software based on the MATLAB environment is programmed to estimate the energy produced from each system with the important technical. financial. and environmental indicators. It is found that the alternative of installing a 1 MW PV system is the installation of 1 MWe PT-CSP systems with 14.5 h or 18.5 h TES. Introducing TES improves the dispatchability of the system and the capacity factor which consequently justifies the PT-CSP system investment. Increasing the degree of dispatchability improves the capacity factor of the PT-CSP system from 21% at 0 h TES to 57% at 18.5 h TES (24 h operation). The capacity factor of the PV system is 18.7% which is mostly similar to PT-CSP with zero dispatchability (0 h TES). The study considers the environmental benefits by estimating the amount of avoided CO2 emissions. and it was found that increasing the capacity factor augments the environmental benefits.,True,3kZZm4EAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,3,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2019/4097852/,11275498182907151991,/scholar?cites=11275498182907151991,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2019/4097852/,0,0,0

Sc.),1,151-172,najah university,Palestine owns high potential of solar energy radiations at the same time it suffers from high prices and shortage of conventional energy sources. The exploitation of renewable energy sources especially solar energy is considered one of the robust alternatives. A passive open-loop domestic solar water heater (SWH) system for a typical house in Palestine using glazed and evacuated tubes solar collectors is technically and financially evaluated in this paper. Palestine territories (West bank and Gaza strip) are divided into five sites in order to study the performance of domestic SWH all over the country. The RETScreen® software solar water heating project model is utilized in this paper to perform simulations for different cases and conditions. The simulations approved that the optimal tilt angle of the solar collectors in all sites is the latitude of each site or latitude plus 15. therefore the tilt angle is adjusted to 45.

Some performance indexes are evaluated: the frequency-deviation. the stability of the DC bus voltage. and the AC voltage total harmonic distortion. The performance of the planned scheme is assessed by two 24-hours simulation sets. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of FLC based management. Moreover. the effectiveness of the FLC approach is compared with the deterministic approach. FLC approach has saved 18.7% from the daily load over the deterministic approach. The study shows that the quality of the power signal in the case of FLC is better than the deterministic approach.,True,3kZZm4EAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aysar_Yasin/publication/348549412_Fuzzy_logic_power_management_for_a_PVWind_microgrid_with_backup_and_storage_systems/links/6015140fa6fdcc071ba15218/Fuzzy-logic-power-management-for-a-PV-Wind-microgrid-with-backup-and-storage-systems.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aysar_Yasin/publication/348549412_Fuzzy_logic_power_management_for_a_PVWind_microgrid_with_backup_and_storage_systems/links/6015140fa6fdcc071ba15218/Fuzzy-logic-power-management-for-a-PV-Wind-microgrid-with-backup-and-storage-systems.pdf,0,0,0

All rights reserved-Volume,3,254,,This paper investigates-technically and economically-the possibility of implementing the concentrated solar power (CSP) technology in the Palestinian Territories (PT) to fulfill their escalating electricity demand. For this purpose. five PT sites. namely Jericho. Nablus. Hebron. Ramallah. and Gaza Strip. are selected to investigate their suitability for installing a 1 MW CSP plant with parabolic trough collectors. The obtained results show that all of the investigated sites–except for Gaza Strip-are appropriate candidates for implementing the proposed CSP plant. With a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) reaching 0.164 US $/kWh (without storage) and 0.153 US $/kWh (with 3 hours of storage) in addition to a simple payback period (SPP)-of applying the CSP plant–reaching 7.5 years (without storage) and 7.6 years (with 3 hours of storage). Ramallah proves to be the most suitable site for installing the proposed plant. followed by Hebron. Nablus and Jericho. On the contrary. Gaza Strip-with LCOE of 0.496 US $/kWh (without storage) and 0.468 US $/kWh (with 3 hours of storage) besides a SPP of 20 years (without storage) and 27 years (with 3 hours of storage)–demonstrate its infeasibility for employing the proposed CSP plant. These facts are also supported by the results of the following investigated meters: the net present value. the annual life cycle savings. and the benefit-cost ratio. The results of the sensitivity analysis disclose that the solar farm’s cost and produced electricity tariff are the prevailing factors in defining the feasibility of applying the CSP technology in PT.,True,3kZZm4EAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aysar_Yasin/publication/344209362_Techno-Economic_Assessment_of_Implementing_Concentrated_Solar_Power_Technology_in_the_Palestinian_Territories/links/5f5bcef04585154dbbcb22f2/Techno-Economic-Assessment-of-Implementing-Concentrated-Solar-Power-Technology-in-the-Palestinian-Territories.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aysar_Yasin/publication/344209362_Techno-Economic_Assessment_of_Implementing_Concentrated_Solar_Power_Technology_in_the_Palestinian_Territories/links/5f5bcef04585154dbbcb22f2/Techno-Economic-Assessment-of-Implementing-Concentrated-Solar-Power-Technology-in-the-Palestinian-Territories.pdf,0,0,0

The selection of the optimal internal configuration for a hybrid generation plant from renewable energies is a complex task and no widely accepted design tools are today available to compare the features of different possible architectures for a given combination of solar irradiation. wind speed and load profiles. To do this a procedure is proposed based on the evaluation of four performance indexes. namely: the global efficiency. the efficiency in transferring energy from RES to BSS. the efficiency in transferring energy from BSS to load and the fraction of useful renewable energy.

This Study presents an experimental investigation on the heat transfer coefficient. temperature difference between the evaporator and the refrigerant inside evaporator channels. overall heat transfer coefficient. and overall thermal resistance in two-phase thermosyphon system. Investigations are carried out at different conditions: different system pressures. two different types of refrigerants R134a and R22. two different evaporator designs. natural and forced convection heat transfer mode in the condenser. The heat flux and the amount of refrigerant are the manipulated parameters in the system. It is found that the heat transfer coefficient increases almost linearly with the applied heat to the evaporator. and reduced pressure. It is also highly dependent on the type of refrigerant. because the performance of the refrigerant R134a likely to be better than that of R22. The heat transfer coefficient is also higher at natural convection condensation than forced convection condensation at the same heat load. while the overall heat transfer coefficient in the system for forced convection is higher than for natural convection condensation. The heat transfer coefficient is highly dependent on the design of evaporator. especially on the diameters channels. The natural convection heat transfer coefficient is found to be 27 kW/m².°C and 3.7 kW/m².°C using R134a and R22. respectively at heat load of 115W.

1152183,Buildings optimal insulation thickness effects on air conditioning capacity and PV self-consumption share level,,Mohammed F Alsayed and Aysar M Yasin,,,,,,Energy conservation projects and renewable energy power generation are the future of sustainable energy supply. Combining both is very effective and maximizes benefits. PTs building sector is the highest consumer. constitute 48.6% of the total Palestinian energy balance. Until now. there is no specific Palestinian engineering building code. As a result. building insulation is still mandatory. There are few performed studies about optimal building insulation thickness economic and environmental benefits. Regarding renewable energy national share increase. the PA developed many ambitious plans. most of which concentrated on increasing PV systems installed capacity due to its high potential. PTs enjoy 3000 sunshine hours per year. 5.4 kWh/m2/day average solar radiation. Few studies are targeting Palestinian building's renewable energy share increase through the principle of selfconsumption. This research presents a novel approach in investigating the economic feasibility of installing optimal insulation thickness in buildings. Practically. insulation layers are assumed to be installed during the building phase. before mechanical building systems. However. the insulation effect will reduce AC required capacity as a result of reducing summer CL. thus. reduce initial investment. For that reason. the P1-P2 method has been used to generalize the optimal insulation thickness approach for the West Bank area considering different Tb values. It has been found that at Tb= 18oC. optimal thickness values. total cost. energy saved. and Np values are 10-11cm. 18$/m2. 175-375$/m2. and 5-14 years. respectively.

The International Organization for Standardization's (ISO) guideline 14044 indicates that economic allocation should only be used as a last resort. when other methods are not suitable. However. the LCA literature reports several examples of the use of economic allocation. This is due partly to its simplicity and partly to its ability to illustrate the properties of complex systems. Sometimes a price summarizes complex attributes of product or service quality that cannot be easily measured by physical criteria. On the other hand. economic allocation does have limitations arising. for example. from the variability of prices and the low correlation between prices and physical flows.

This paper analyzes the performance of a building-integrated thermal storage system to increase the energy performances of solaria in a cold climate. A wall opposing a highly glazed façade (south oriented) is used as thermal storage with phase change materials embedded in the wall. The study is based on both experimental and simulation studies.

In the field of renewable energies this is often a very difficult task. because the energy source is in this case characterized by relevant variations over space and time. This implies that any temporal. but also spatial. estimation model has to be able to incorporate this spatial and temporal variability.The paper deals with the spatial estimation of the wind fields in Sicily (Italy) by following a data-driven approach.

This type of inlet flow was similar to that experienced by naval aircraft during steam catapult launches and has had the potential to adversely affect engine performance. The research was divided into three broad areas: experimental. theoretical and numerical. The first area. experimental. used the Naval Postgraduate School’s transonic compressor rig. The rig was modified to introduce hot steam into the inlet flow during testing. Two rotor-only tests were completed; one with an unswept rotor and the other with a forward swept rotor. The experimental program yielded two sets of results.

The exit air density will then be appreciably lower than the inlet density. The paper presents a one-dimensional compressible flow approach for the calculation of all the thermodynamic variables as dependent on chimney height. wall friction. additional losses. internal drag and area change. The method gives reasonable answers even across a single 1500 m step length used for illustration. but better accuracy is possible with multiple steps. It is also applicable to the rest of the plant where heat transfer and shaft work may be present. It turns out that the pressure drop associated with the vertical acceleration of the air is about four times the pressure drop associated with wall friction.

The specific area of interest is the behavior and location of low-frequency instabilities when operating close to stall. When running close to stall compressors begin to exhibit non-periodic flow between the blade passages even when appearing to be operating in a stable steady-state condition. These frequencies are not geometrically fixed to the rotor and typically appear at 0.3–0.8 of the rotor speed. The presence of these low-frequency instabilities are known and detection are reasonably commonplace. however attempts to quantify the location and strength of these instabilities as stall is approached have proved difficult.

1152320,Local scour around hydraulic structures,2009,Padmini Khwairakpam and Asis Mazumdar,1,International Journal of Recent Trends in Engineering,6,59,Academy Publisher,Scour is a natural phenomenon caused due to the erosive action of flowing stream on alluvial beds which removes the sediment around or near structures located in flowing water. It means the lowering of the riverbed level by water erosions such that there is a tendency to expose the foundations of a structure. It is the result of the erosive action of flowing water. excavating and carrying away material from the bed and banks of streams and from around the piers and abutments of bridges. Scour has been the main cause for failures of marine structures throughout the world. In this paper. an attempt has been made to review few previous studies related to scour. Many researchers have conducted various studies to predict the maximum depth and diameter of scour hole. Vertical piles have been generally used in flumes to investigate the effects of scour. In a few studies. techniques to reduce the scour depth have been employed by making use of splitter plates and collars on the piles. Helical wires or cables wrapped spirally around the pile to resemble a threaded pile have also been used to reduce the scour. With the use of different special techniques. the scour depth has been reported to reduce by modifying the flow field near the piles. Prediction of scour depth is difficult as there are many uncertainties associated with it. Various methods of protecting the erodible soils around foundations of marine structures have also been adopted and such methods sometimes prove costly. It is therefore felt that more studies are still required to predict the scour depth effectively and also to find cost effective ways to reduce the scour.,True,MRk6mvAAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,42,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.7108&rep=rep1&type=pdf,2312176403091406664,/scholar?cites=2312176403091406664,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.7108&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1152324,Safe and efficient control of hydro power plant by fuzzy logic,2012,Priyabrata Adhikary and Pankaj Kr Roy and Asis Mazumdar,2,IJESAT,5,1270-1277,,Many factors related to river run-off are vague. subjective and difficult to quantify. The fuzzy logic method is very useful for such problem solving approach such as small hydro power generation. The rule base and membership functions have a great influence on the performance and efficacy of the plant and also to optimize the small hydro power generation in the high altitude region particularly in India. The fuzzy linguistic variable performance can be easily characterized by common terms. The paper initially presents a new Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) method for safe reservoir control of dams through spillway gates. Finally it presents FLC method for turbine valve to control the water flow through turbine for hydro power generation. Thus it shows overall effective control and operation of the mechanical equipments in a hydro electric power generation project with FLC and its usefulness.

In order to conduct a comparative study. measurements within an equilibrium scour hole at a square pier. an equilateral triangular pier. and a flat plate with sides. facing the approaching flow. equaling the width of the circular pier were taken. Flow in an equilibrium scour hole under a clear water regime was considered for 4 separate tests. Tests were carried out for approaching flow having undisturbed constant flow depth greater than the pier width with a depth-averaged approaching flow velocity of about 68.2% representing the critical velocity of the uniform sand bed. It was observed that all the equilibrium dimensionless scour parameters. namely scour depth. length. width. area. and volume. depend on the effective pier width equal to the diameter of the smallest circumscribing circle of the pier. When the effective pier diameter increases and approaching flow depth is constant. scour parameters increase. Based on the results. some empirical equations are proposed for the scour depth. scour length. scour width. scour area. and scour volume.

Wetlands provide many substantial benefits not only to local society. but also to the people. who live far away from wetlands. These benefits are mainly numerous services. flood control. groundwater recharging and pollution reduction. Naturally. from the point of view of economy as well as ecology. the significance of wetland and stakeholders’ participation for preserving the wetland is huge. The objective of the present paper is to evaluate the economic valuation of an important floodplain wetland in the lower Gangetic basin. The focus is extended to notice the status of different mouzas with respect to their economic structure through cluster analysis and to optimize the number of working population involved in different occupations in such a way that the per capita economic valuation of each mouza is maximized. In this study. the wetland related occupations are selected and with help of income estimation method. the economic valuation of every mouza is calculated. Minitab-15 is applied to get a complete scenario of status of the mouzas in terms of their economic structure through the cluster analysis. However. the optimization problem boils down with the help of Matlab environment.

This has implications for our knowledge on the design requirements of such socially embedded IT. The paper reviews tools that are designed for the purpose to foster social capital. We will then discuss what is needed for an IS design theory related to knowledge communities and how such a theory could incorporate social capital theory.,True,6GTX5ZoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,550,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1057/palgrave.jit.2000053,1807164115056600193,/scholar?cites=1807164115056600193,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marleen_Huysman/publication/220220740_IT_to_Support_Knowledge_Sharing_in_Communities_towards_a_Social_Capital_Analysis/links/02e7e534e590d87e5b000000.pdf,0,0,0
1152369,Infrastructuring: Toward an integrated perspective on the design and use of information technology,2009,Volkmar Pipek and Volker Wulf,10,Journal of the Association for Information Systems,5,1,,In this contribution. we investigate how results from the ongoing discussion about e-Infrastructures can be used to improve the design of IT infrastructures in organizations. We first establish a perspective on organizational IT as work infrastructure that focuses on the infrastructural nature of organizational Information Systems and describe challenges for designing within and for this type of infrastructure. Then we elaborate on possible use of concepts from the e-infrastructure discussion. in particular on the concept of infrastructuring as it was developed by Star and Ruhleder (1996) and Star and Bowker (2002). Using their “salient characteristics of infrastructure” we describe the methodological approach of Infrastructuring to develop methodological and tool support for all stakeholders’ activities that contribute to the successful establishment of an information system usage (equivalent to a work infrastructure improvement). We illustrate our ideas by drawing on a case in which new work infrastructures are introduced into an organizational context and by mapping out existing and possible tool support for infrastructuring.,True,6GTX5ZoAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,507,https://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol10/iss5/1/,15075839325650082928,/scholar?cites=15075839325650082928,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.163.9558&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1152371,Social capital and information technology,2004,Marleen Huysman and Volker Wulf,,,,,MIT Press,A multidisciplinary examination of the interplay between social capital--the value derived from social ties--and information technology. The concept of social capital. or the value that can be derived from social ties created by goodwill. mutual support. shared language. common beliefs. and a sense of mutual obligation. has been applied to a number of fields. from sociology to management. It is only lately. however. that researchers in information technology and knowledge management have begun to explore the idea of social capital in relation to their fields. This collection of thirteen essays by computer scientists. sociologists. communication specialists. economists. and others presents a multidisciplinary look at this particular intersection of information technology and social science and the need to adopt a sociotechnical perspective. For the most part the contributors take a positive view of the interplay of social capital. knowledge sharing. and community building. Some essays look at specific instances. including the on-line and face-to-face relationships of a community of athletes. the building of social capital among Iranian NGOs. and the Internet-based communities created by the open-source movement. while others discuss more general ideas of civic and personal communities. The last four essays examine computer applications that augment social capital. including topic-and member-centered communications spaces such as the Expert Finder and the Loops system and virtual repositories of knowledge such as the Answer Garden and Pearls of Wisdom.,True,6GTX5ZoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,349,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8uYbB1AeVrYC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:XV_OtpQDK-YJ:scholar.google.com&ots=ABxlrNyk1Q&sig=lO4H43_Cl6WYBjVSZ7XTP5IL_OA,16585353989979004765,/scholar?cites=16585353989979004765,,,0,0,0

CSCW. over the last 20 years. has taken a critical stance towards most of these approaches. and instead. CSCW shifted the focus towards a practice-based perspective. This paper surveys CSCW researchers’ viewpoints on what has become called ‘knowledge sharing’ and ‘expertise sharing’. These are based in an understanding of the social contexts of knowledge work and practices. as well as in an emphasis on communication among knowledgeable humans. The paper provides a summary and overview of the two strands of knowledge and expertise sharing in CSCW. which. from an analytical standpoint. roughly represent ‘generations’ of research: an ‘object-centric’ and a ‘people-centric’ view.

Flexibility offered by component technologies typically addresses software developers at design time. However. the design of software which should support social systems. such as work groups or communities. also demands ‘use-time’. or technically spoken. ‘run-time’ flexibility. In this paper. we summarize a decade of research efforts on component-based approaches to flexibilize groupware applications at run-time. We address the user as a ‘casual programmer’ who develops and individualizes software for his work context. To deal with the challenges of run-time flexibility. we developed a design approach which covers three levels: software architecture. user interface. and collaboration support. With regard to the software architecture. a component model. called FlexiBeans. has been developed.

1152382,Social capital and information technology: Current debates and research,2004,Marleen Huysman and Volker Wulf,,Social capital and information technology,,1-16,MIT Press,Social capital has recently gained importance in a variety of research fields. The concept was originally introduced by sociologists and political scientists. Lately. scholars in organizational and management sciences have shown an increased interest in the concept. Social capital refers to network ties of goodwill. mutual support. shared language. shared norms. social trust. and a sense of mutual obligation that people can derive value from. It is understood as the glue that holds together social aggregates such as networks of personal relationships. communities. regions. or even whole nations.Social capital is about the value derived from being a member of a society or community. By being a member. people have access to resources that are not available to nonmembers. Research on social capital varies as to the type of resources that are gained from being member of a social network or community. For example. resources range from those that aid potential career moves or entrepreneurial start-up processes to services in so-called developing countries. Social capital has also been adopted recently by researchers interested in the topic of organizational learning and knowledge management. Although the concept of social capital has a much longer existence (cf. Hanifan 1916). it has become a prominent topic of discussion over the last two decades. Its emergence within the fields of political science and sociology started as a critic of the narrow analytic perspective on economic activities that is immanent in the neoclassical school of macroeconomic thinking (eg. Bourdieu 1986; Granovetter 1985; Uzzi 1997).

Ltd,The impact of culture on knowledge management in international teams is an important topic which is still not well understood. We contribute to the discussion by presenting two case studies of small software teams involved in distributed software development. In doing so. we illustrate how cultural and social issues influence the way knowledge exchange is performed by analyzing four knowledge sharing practices: status meetings and maintaining awareness. the collaborative use of shared artifacts and repositories. spending time at the other site and human ‘bridges’ that mediate between people and cultures. Our findings suggest that organizational culture is permanently re‐negotiated and adjusted to fit the distributed collaboration. as the teams learn how to deal with each other.

For this purpose we analyzed the Twitter communication by the London Metropolitan Police (MET) and the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) during the riots in August 2011. The systematic comparison of tweets demonstrates that the two forces developed very different practices for using Twitter. While MET followed an instrumental approach in their communication. in which the police aimed to remain in a controlled position and keep a distance to the general public. GMP developed an expressive approach. in which the police actively decreased the distance to the citizens.

Analyzing twitter use during the 2011 UK riots,2017,Mila Gascó and Petra Saskia Bayerl and Sebastian Denef and Babak Akhgar,34,Government Information Quarterly,4,635-645,JAI,The use of social media during crises has been explored in a variety of natural and man-made crisis situations. Yet. most of these studies have focused exclusively on the communication strategies and messages sent by crisis responders. Surprisingly little research has been done on how crisis publics (i.e.. those people interested in or affected by the crisis) use social media during such events. Our article addresses this gap in the context of citizens' Twitter use during the 2011 riots in the UK. Focusing on communications with and about police forces in two cities. we analyzed 5984 citizen tweets collected during the event for content and sentiment. Comparing the two cases. our findings suggest that citizens' Twitter communication follows a general logic of concerns. but can also be influenced very easily by single. non-crisis related events such as perceived missteps in a police force's Twitter communication.

Designing meaningful solutions for this complex work environment requires reflective thought and conceptual understanding of its social configuration. This paper presents organizing patterns of firefighting frontline practice as a means to inform ubiquitous computing design processes. The patterns originate from a qualitative analysis of an extensive range of user studies conducted with French and German firefighters.

It presents a history of ethnography. both as it was practiced before computer science picked it up and since. most especially in the CSCW and HCI domains. It examines. further. the various ethnographic or ‘fieldwork’frameworks currently popular. explaining and examining what each claims and entails. The focus of the book throughout is on the practical relationship between theory and practice. a relationship that is often misunderstood yet fundamental to successful design. The book is illustrated with real examples from the authors’ various experiences in academic and commercial settings. reporting on the use of ethnography before. during and after design innovation and implementation. The result is a book that provides the working knowledge necessary for using any kind of ethnographic approach in the design of computer technologies.

It does not arise simply where more than one person is involved. and other attempts to delimit the field do not succeed. Since all work is socially organised. it would seem that all work potentially falls within the CSCW domain. If so. then (i) it would not be confined to a particular class of system (‘groupware’); (ii) it would not be a small specialism but would extend virtually throughout system design; and (iii) its interdisciplinary character would affect large areas of its contributing disciplines. We defend these consequences. and argue that CSCW is therefore more akin to a paradigm shift for its contributing disciplines than a particular subdiscipline in itself.

The experience gained in the use of the large thermohydraulic codes identified three basis conditions that should be fulfilled for the correct use of the large thermohydraulic codes: - Used codes should be frozen and qualified through international assessment program; - Developer of the nodalization should be qualified to the use of the chosen code; - Nodalization of the plant should be properly qualified. Qualified plant nodalization has been developed in three stages: 1. Build-up of the qualified plant data base; 2. Development of the plant nodalization. or so called base input deck; 3.

However continuous improvements in analytical techniques and in the sophistication of hardware products do not necessarily correspond to new industrial applications within Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) technology. The declining condition for nuclear technology also contributes to the lag between developments and applications definitely causing NPP safety at a level below the achievable level. The possibility to extend BEPU to all areas of the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). so-called BEPUFSAR is outlined in the paper. This should be combined with the Extension of the SM concept (E-SM). BEPUFSAR techniques may be at the origin of E-SM which also will need specific monitoring hardware.

Following an outline of the complexity of the NST concept attention is given to the licensing process. Licensor and licensee are key actors for conducting the licensing process. Highly competent technologists are needed for and active role in the process: this may require life experience in specific subjects. The availability of such personnel is difficult to be gathered by any individual company or institution. whatever licensor or licensee. This is true even in Countries where nuclear technology was developed soon after the second World War. The same condition to engage life-experts for each specific licensing subject is almost unreachable in Countries where the exploitation of nuclear technology started later or. anyway. in small Countries. Deep expertise is also required when an innovative nuclear installation is designed and put in operation. As a consequence of all of this. either the actual licensing processes are not performed according to the best practice available at the international level. or the cost of the process. ie of involving top level expertise in each licensing subject. may become prohibitive. The bases are put to constitute a Consortium of Competence in Nuclear Technology (COCONUT) where the key licensing subjects are identified and the life-experts for each subject are cooperating.

Differences. expected between the calculated NPP scenario and the measured ITF scenario must be fully understood (this is achieved by performing a variety of sensitivity analyses): the final product of the activity is  to the best possible “qualified” NPP nodalization.,True,WcvwdLgAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,5,https://arpi.unipi.it/handle/11568/898897,10453147656504668324,/scholar?cites=10453147656504668324,,,0,0,0

1152480,Modelling sustainable development scenarios of Croatian power system,2010,Robert Pašičko and Zoran Stanić and Nenad Debrecin,61,Journal of Electrical Engineering,3,157-163,Sciendo,The main objective of power system sustainable development is to provide the security of electricity supply required to underpin economic growth and increase the quality of living while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. New challenges such as deregulation. liberalization of energy markets. increased competition on energy markets. growing demands on security of supply. price insecurities and demand to cut CO2 emissions. are calling for better understanding of electrical systems modelling. Existing models are not sufficient anymore and planners will need to think differently in order to face these challenges. Such a model. on the basis on performed simulations. should enable planner to distinguish between different options and to analyze sustainability of these options. PLEXOS is an electricity market simulation model. used for modeling electrical system in Croatia since 2005. Within this paper. generation expansion scenarios until 2020 developed for Croatian Energy Strategy and modeled in PLEXOS. Development of sustainable Croatian energy scenario was analyzed in the paper - impacts of CO2 emission price and wind generation. Energy Strategy sets goal for 1200 MW from wind power plants in 2020. In order to fully understand its impacts. intermittent nature of electricity generation from wind power plant was modeled. We conclude that electrical system modelling using everyday growing models has proved to be inevitable for sustainable electrical system planning in complex environment in which power plants operate today.,True,WcvwdLgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,4,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jee/61/3/article-p157.xml,12385788454333540632,/scholar?cites=12385788454333540632,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/jee/61/3/article-p157.xml,0,0,0

Formerly Kluwer Academic Publishers BV,Muonium (Mu=mgr++e-) is the bound state of a positive muon and an electron. Since the positive muon has a mass about 1/9 of the proton. Mu can be regarded as an ultra light isotope of hydrogen with unusually large mass ratios (MuratioHratioDratioT=1/9ratio1ratio2ratio3). The muon spin rotation technique (mgrSR) relies on the facts that (1) the muon produced in pion decay. pgr+rarrratio+ + ugrratio. is 100% spin polarized and (2) the positron from muon decay is emitted preferentially along the instantaneous muon spin direction at the time of the muon decay.In transverse field mgrSR (TF-mgrSR). the precession of the muon spin in muonium substituted radicals is directly observed by detecting decay positrons time differentially. From observed radical frequencies. the hyperfine coupling constants (Amgr) of C2H4Mu. C2D4Mu.13C2H4Mu. C2F4Mu. and C2H3FMu are determined.

Emphasis is given to the motivations or the needs for the barrier. Two main parts of the paper can be distinguished. The following topics are discussed in the former part (section 2):(a) the weakness of the barrier constituted by the current design of nuclear fuel;(b) the continuously increasing complexity of the system. with main reference to the Instrumentation and Control (I&C);(c) the role that the Large Break Loss of Coolant Accident (LBLOCA) had for arriving at the current layout of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). Furthermore avoiding the severe accidents in 1979. 1987 and 2011. is at the basis of the proposal.

1152488,Applicability of coupled code RELAP5/GOTHIC to NPP Krsko MSLB calculation,2005,Mario Keco and Nenad Debrecin and D Grgic,,,,,,Usual way to analyze Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) accident in PWR plants is to calculate core and containment responses in two separate calculations. In first calculation system code is used to address behaviour of nuclear steam supply system and containment is modelled mainly as a boundary condition. In second calculation mass and energy release data are used to perform containment analysis. Coupled code R5G realized by direct explicit coupling of system code RELAP5/MOD3.3 and containment code GOTHIC is able to perform both calculations simultaneously. In this paper R5G is applied to calculation of MSLB accident in large dry containment of NPP Krsko. Standard separate calculation is performed first and then both core and containment responses are compared against corresponding coupled code results. Two versions of GOTHIC code are used. one old ver 3.4e and the last one ver 7.2. As expected. differences between standard procedure and coupled calculations are small. The performed analyses showed that classical uncoupled approach is applicable in case of large dry containment calculation. but that new approach can bring some additional insight in understanding of the transient and that can be used as simple and reliable procedure in performing MSLB calculation without any significant calculation overhead.

An approach for deriving marginal cost curves for energy and ancillary services is proposed. taking into consideration price uncertainty and opportunity cost of water. which can later be used to determine hourly bid curves. The proposed approach combines an hourly conditional value-at-risk. probability of occurrence of automatic generation control states and an opportunity cost of water to determine energy and ancillary services marginal cost curves. The proposed approach is in a linear constraint form and is easy to implement in optimization problems. A stochastic model of the hydro-economic river basin is presented. based on the actual Vinodol hydropower system in Croatia. with a complex three-dimensional relationship between the power produced. the discharged water. and the head of associated reservoir.

Companies are participants of the day-ahead electricity market. The incumbent company owns the existing hydropower plants and holds concessions for the water. The new company decides to build a pump storage hydropower plant that uses one of the existing reservoirs as its lower reservoir. Meeting reservoir water balance is affected by decisions by both companies which are independently seeking maximal profit. Methods for water use settlement and preventing of spillage are proposed. A mixed-integer linear programming approach is used. Head effects on output power levels are also considered. Existences of dispatches that satisfy both companies are shown.

The approach for construction of the joint short-run marginal cost curve for the hydro-wind coordinated generation is proposed and applied on the real example. This joint short-run marginal cost curve is important for its participation in the energy markets and for economic feasibility assessment of such coordination. The approach credibly describes the short-run marginal costs which this coordination bears in “real life”. The approach is based on the duality framework of a convex programming and as a novelty combines the shadow price of risk mitigation. which quantifies the hourly cost of mitigating risk. and the water shadow price. which quantifies the marginal cost of electricity production. The proposed approach is formulated as a stochastic linear program and tested on the case of the Vinodol hydropower system and the wind farm Vrataruša in Croatia. The result of the case study is a family of 24 joint short-run marginal cost curves.

The paper. defines and quantifies new criterions for assessing enhanced geothermal systems for a particular site. For evaluation of the relative importance of each criterion in decision making. the weight is associated with each of the listed criterions. The different scenarios of end-use applications are tested in the case study. Finally. in the case study. the data and statistics are collected from real geothermal plants. The case study provides results for several scenarios and the sensitivity analysis based on which the approach is validated.

Geotherm. Reserv. Eng. Stanford Univ,,,,In Europe. only a few industrial geothermal plants based on the Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) technology (Soultz-sous-Forêts and Rittershoffen in Alsace. France and Insheim in Germany) are operating. Most of them are located in the Upper Rhine Graben and are related to the exploitation of natural fluids trapped in deep fractured hard rocks made of clastic tertiary sediments and/or crystalline rocks. The European commission decided to further explore and exploit its EGS potential by supporting the development of innovative techniques in different geological conditions. At European scale. these are deep sedimentary basins (eg the Southern Permian Basin area. the Pannonian Basin and the various foreland basins of the Alps and the Pyrenees) and the metamorphic and crystalline rocks of the Variscan orogen. which forms most of the bedrock of central and southern Europe. More than 70% of the overall geothermal potential of Europe is located in low permeable bedrock only exploitable by EGS technology. which allows–theoretically–a permanent heat and electricity production at any place. However. for the implementation of enhanced geothermal energy systems into our future energy supply. distribution infrastructures dealing with EGS are crucial. Only EGS makes geothermal energy-heating or heat storage–exploitable at large scale and in view of a significant market penetration.Until now. main drawbacks of EGS are related to 1) high costs (drilling.

Hence investment choice not only needs to be optimal. but it also needs to be robust enough to cope with uncertainties which occur during payback period. In this research. a family of flow duration curves is created to model stochastic nature of water availability. The risk-constrained approach for assessment of investments in cascaded hydropower plants is proposed in a form of a mixed-integer linear programming.

Becoming independent and market oriented subjects. the value of water and positioning of hydro power plants on the energy market requires new scheduling solutions. This paper proposes a new model of the power system scheduling where hydro power plants have an active role as market participants. The idea is based on the existing model which observes only the behavior of thermal power plants. Case study includes several scenarios which demonstrate the optimal utilization of water resources with the goal of maximizing the profit of each hydro power plant in the cascade system.

Among other possible solutions. one very most promising tool is the significant electrification of the transport sector. A slightly modified and already verified power system model used for Croatian low-carbon strategy was used here. The PLEXOS software was used to model the Croatian power system by simulating different scenarios. Two scenarios were examined: with and without electric vehicles. This research aimed to evaluate the total decrease in CO 2 emissions from both the transport and power sectors due to the increased number of electrical vehicles. The analysis of the Croatian power system was used to assess the flexibility potential of such a large number of electrical vehicles on power system flexibility while considering the volatile nature of wind and solar. Additionally. a question regarding solar availability and simultaneous low-availability of parked electrical vehicles was also examined.

The starting point of EU policy for the way towards low carbon economy is a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Power sector by 93-99% by 2050. In line with this objective. in 2014 the European Council adopted the climate-energy frame of 2030. which sets the goal of reducing emissions-40% by 2030. Also. there is the goal of renewable energy sources to 27% and an indicative target is to reduce energy consumption by 27%. In the electricity sector. in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions her goal is to increase the security of energy supply. sustainability of energy supply. increase the availability of energy and reduce energy dependency. In that sense European Council listed measures with priority in the promotion of energy efficiency. renewable energy. resource efficiency. advanced network and intelligent energy supply system. low emissions vehicles and vehicles with electric drive. energy storages but also the possible application of technology to capture and storage of CO2 in geological formations. In developing of low carbon strategies a variety of scenarios can be analysed.

1152531,Analysis of Offering Continuous Level of Power to Electricity Market from Wind Plants and Back-Up Plant––What Flexibility Should Have The NPP?,2019,Željko Tomšić and Ivan Rajšl and M Filipović,,,IAEA-TECDOC--1885,,,[en] Wind power varies over time and variations occur on all time scales. Understanding these variations and their predictability is of key importance for the integration and optimal utilization of wind in the power system. Due to the variability and uncertainty. wind plants cannot offer a continuous level of power to electricity market. The main motivation for this analysis is to investigate possibilities to participate in the electricity market by offering continuous guaranteed power from wind plants by a backup plant. If NPPs and RESs want to become ‘friends’. it is necessary to determine which minimum characteristics of feasibility the NPPs should have. A model of electricity production from wind farms and a backup plant was developed based on real hourly and minute by minute electricity production from wind plants. For the calculation. the following parameters are necessary: ramp up and down rate. time of start time reduction. fuel mass flow during start. electricity production during start. variable cost of the startup process. cost and charges for lifetime consumption for each start and start type. remuneration during startup time regarding expected or unexpected starts and the cost and revenue for balancing energy. In the analysis. because all needed parameters for the NPP are not known. a backup plant was selected to be a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant with input data and all characteristics on hourly and minute by minute timescales. Hourly analysis showed that there was no problem with delivery of the defined power. but the minute by minute resolution analysis showed that the backup plant could not always cover rapid changes in …,True,ETjUaMQAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:51081719,,,,,0,0,0

U centru su uzroci kao pad likvidnosti ekonomije SAD-a i kamatnih stopa. razvoj novih instrumenata financija. podcjenjivanje realnog rizika i smanjenje potrebnih razina kontrole. Kriza se pogađanjem hipotekarnih kredita i financija razvila sa posljedicama smanjenja proizvodnje. pada zapošljavanja i opće zaposlenosti. Nakon toga nastupa velika recesija. kao posljedica problema tržišta vrijednosnica. nekretnina. hipoteka. kredita i ostaloga. Ona predstavlja razdoblje općenitog ekonomskog slabljenja svjetskog tržišta. Tranzicijske zemlje su većinom sastavljene od postsocijalističkih zemalja u procesu prelaska na parlamentarnu demokraciju i tržišnu ekonomiju. Za postignuće navedenog. najosnovnije se mora postići prisutnost privatnog vlasništva i njegovih prava. Proces tranzicije postiže se kroz njegove glavne djelove odnosno liberalizaciju. restrukturaciju i privatizaciju. makroekonomsko stabiliziranje te institucionalne i pravne promjene odnosno reforme. Tranzicijske zemlje Srednje i Istočne Europe bile su pogođene krizom na načine prisvajanja neoliberalizma.

1152536,Operating Reserve Allocation Methods Relative to Energy Unit Commitment,2017,Ivan PAVIĆ and Matea FILIPOVIĆ and Igor KUZLE and Yong-qian LIU,,"DEStech Transactions on Environment, Energy and Earth Sciences",icepe,,,The most distinguished global trend in power systems development in the last decade is by far rapid growth of power generating facilities driven by renewable energy resources. In theory. their primary energy source is a free natural resource such as wind or solar radiation. therefore. their integration should lead to lower marginal costs at wholesale level and therefore lower retail electricity prices payed by end-consumers. The problem lies in their non-dispatchable and stochastic nature. Inability to be dispatched in accordance to power system real-time conditions means that they cannot be committed in the time of need for the power system. ie. they are unable to provide balancing reserves. Stochasticity of their generation leads to greater need for flexible units capable of changing their operating point. ie the greater need for operating reserve units. One can conclude. when the share of renewable energy sources increases. the share of units capable of operating reserves provision decreases. but at the same time the operating reserve requirements increase. Possibilities to solve mentioned problem and to bolster further renewable energy sources integration range from integration of a new flexible conventional units (such as gas power plants). or an energy storage technologies. to usage of renewable units for operating reserves provision despite their lost opportunity cost occurrence. When observing operating reserve’s adequacy. it is very important to evaluate the way how it is allocated. With efficient reserve allocation method. the need for additional investments in power system flexibility are deferred and mitigated.

Tijekom akcidenta u nuklearnoj elektrani dolazi do oštećenja goriva. Iz goriva se oslobađaju radioaktivni elementi u kontejment i grupiraju se u kategorije po sličnim svojstvima. Nakon oslobađanja iz elektrane radioaktivni ispust se promatra u dozama te se prati njegova disperzija u okoliš. Neki učinci primljenih doza ne mogu se vidjeti odmah već je za to potreban dulji vremenski period. Vrlo je važno pravovremeno utvrditi smjer kretanja ispusta kako bi se poduzele potrebne mjere i akcije zaštite ljudske populacije.

Ovakve varijacije prisutne su neovisno o trajanju promatranog vremenskog perioda. Stoga je razumijevanje i poznavanje podataka ove varijabilnosti ključan faktor kod uključivanja vjetroelektrana u elektroenergetski sustav kao i njihovog optimalnog korištenja unutar njega. Osnovna dva atributa promjenjive proizvodnje vjetroelektrana su varijabilnost i nesigurnost. Upravo zbog ovih karakteristika vjetroelektranama je otežano sudjelovanje na tržištu električne energije. posebice na burzama. Za navedene potrebe nužno je osigurati neku vrstu potpore vjetroelektranama s ciljem smanjenja varijabilnosti njihove izlazne snage. Ovaj rad predstavlja jednu takvu potporu i to u smislu plinskih elektrana kombiniranog ciklusa (CCGT). U programskom paketu PLEXOS razvijen je model vjetroelektrana i CCGT elektrane koji se temelji na stvarnim satnim vrijednostima kao i detaljnim karakteristikama CCGT postrojenja. Posebice su analizirana tehno-ekonomske karakteristike CCGT postrojenja uzimajući u obzir brzinu promjene snage kao i različite načine pokretanja.

Međunarodno Znanstveno-Stručno Savjetovanje/12. International Symposium: Power and Process Plants,,,,Kao posljedica velikog iskorištavanja prirodnih resursa i zagađenja okoliša javila se potreba za održivim planiranjem koje bi ujedinilo ekonomske. okolišne i društvene aspekte. Energetika je grana koja omogućuje održavanje današnjeg životnog standarda. ali također uvelike utječe na mijenjanje našeg okoliša. Pojam koji opisuje negativan učinak proizvodnje električne energije. odnosno troškove pridružene nekompenziranim štetama koje se javljaju kao neželjena posljedica proizvodnje električne energije je eksterni trošak. Proračun eksternih troškova može uvelike utjecati na donošenje odluka u planiranju i vođenju elektroenergetskog sustava. Izražavanje eksternog troška u novčanim vrijednostima. odnosno novčano vrednovanje svih utjecaja na okoliš smanjuje subjektivnost postupka donošenja odluke te omogućuje lakše uspoređivanje ponuđenih opcija. Ovaj članak donosi opis proračuna eksternog troška termoelektrana u Hrvatskoj korištenjem modela SIMPACTS (Simplified Approach for Estimating Impacts of Electricity Generation). SIMPACTS je vrlo jednostavan model za procjenu utjecaja na okoliš i eksternih troškova raznih tehnologija za proizvodnju električne energije koji ne zahtijeva veliku količinu ulaznih podataka. ali ipak pruža prilično točne i pouzdane rezultate.

SMRs have been recurrently studied in the past. from early days of nuclear power. but have never gained sufficient traction to reach commercialization. This situation persisted also in the 1990s; the focus was on large reactors based on the presumed common wisdom of this being the only way to make the nuclear power plants competitive. IRIS is one of several small reactor concepts that originated in the late 1990s. However. the specific role and significance of IRIS is that it systematically pursued resolving technology gaps. addressing safety. licensing. and deployment issues and performing credible economics analyses. which ultimately made it possible—together with other SMR projects—to cross the “skepticism …,True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC,33,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/NT12-A13555,8055184469670970403,/scholar?cites=8055184469670970403,,,0,0,0

After successfully completing the conceptual design phase. IRIS is now finalizing the preliminary design as well. The pre-application licensing review with the U.S. NRC has been initiated in October of 2002. The safety-by-design approach and PRA-guided design open the possibility to aim for licensing not requiring off-site emergency response planning. Multiple single-unit and twin-unit site layouts have been developed within the ESP (Early Site Permit) program currently pursued by three U.S. power utilities. Desalination and district heating options have recently been added to the base design. Staggered construction schedules of multiple units may be applied to optimize cash-flow and minimize the required investment. making IRIS a financially attractive option. even for economies with limited investment capabilities.

The IRIS concept addresses the key-requirements defined by the US DOE for next generation reactors. i.e. enhanced reliability and safety. and improved economics. It features innovative. advanced engineering. but it is firmly based on the proven technology of pressurized water reactors (PWR). An innovative safety approach has been developed to mitigate the IRIS response to small-to-medium Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). This strategy is based on the interaction of IRIS compact containment with the reactor vessel to limit initial blowdown. and on depressurization through the use of a passive Emergency Heat Removal System (EHRS). A small Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) provides supplementary depressurization capability. A pressure suppression system is provided to limit the pressure peak following the initial blowdown to well below the containment design limit. The ultimate result is that during a small-to-medium LOCA. the core remains covered for an extended period of time. without credit for emergency water injection or external core makeup. The IRIS LOCA response is based on 'maintaining water inventory' rather than on the principle of safety injection. This novel safety approach poses significant issues for computational and analysis methods since the IRIS vessel and containment are strongly coupled. and the system response is based on the interaction between …,True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,2,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20680875,18148033684498943056,/scholar?cites=18148033684498943056,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/20680875,0,0,0

The modification consisted in altering the reactor vessel internals in such way that the coolant downflow path in the baffle-barrel region was converted to an upflow path. Thereby. the pressure difference across the baffle joints has been minimized and the baffle jetting as a major cause of damage of peripheral fuel elements has been eliminated. As a support to the UFC modification review. thermal-hydraulic analyses of the Direct Vessel Injection (DVI) line Small Break Loss Of Coolant Accident (SB LOCA) have been analyzed using RELAP5/mod 3.3 code along with the FRAPTRAN calculation for hot fuel rod. Both the downflow configuration (pre-UFC) and the upflow configuration (UFC) were considered in the analyses to assess influence of the modification. Depending on the assumptions used in calculation small increase in Peak Cladding Temperatures (PCT) was predicted due to UFC. but safety limits are not endangered.,True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,1,https://arhiv.djs.si/proc/nene2015/pdf/NENE2015_207.pdf,16620717551104599525,/scholar?cites=16620717551104599525,,https://arhiv.djs.si/proc/nene2015/pdf/NENE2015_207.pdf,0,0,0

1152558,Nuclear power plant as a potential option for sustainable development of electrical power generation in Croatia,2008,Danilo Feretić and Nikola Čavlina,,"International Congress"" Energy and the environment 2008"": proceedings",,345,,The aim of the paper is to compare potential options for future electricity generation in Croatia having low environmental impact. From this reason nuclear plants. wind plants and natural gas plants are considered. but power plants using coal are not included in the analysis. Base for the analysis is electrical energy demand in Croatia up to the end of next decade. The sustainability of electricity generation besides low environmental impact requires economic acceptability of considered generating option and energy supply security (depending upon availability of energy source whenever is required by energy users). Due to the last requirement it is not possible to consider wind plants alone. but only when associated with a stable energy supplier. In the paper probabilistic analytical method is applied to compare economics (discounted net cash flow) and carbon dioxide emissions of combined system consisting of natural gas plants and wind plants versus nuclear power plant. Probabilistic method of analysis allows inclusion of uncertainties in future electricity generating cost prediction. particularly in respect to fuel costs changes.,True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://www.bib.irb.hr/428169?rad=428169,7032552729793162546,/scholar?cites=7032552729793162546,,,0,0,0
1152559,IRIS: A Comprehensive Approach to Implementing Nuclear Power in Countries with Smaller Electric Grids,2008,B Petrovic and Mario D Carelli and Layla Sandell and GD Storrick and N Cavlina,,,,,,Many emerging markets and smaller size countries are considering the nuclear option and the deployment of their first nuclear reactor(s). However. some of their requirements and available infrastructure are quite different from those of larger countries currently employing nuclear power. Specific considerations might include: a small size electrical grid. in some cases on the order of a few GWe; limited financial resources; no nuclear experience; inadequate availability of necessary material and people infrastructure. Large nuclear power plants of 1000 MWe or greater do not provide best fit. The IRIS (International Reactor Innovative and Secure) reactor. under development by an international team of eighteen organizations from nine countries led by Westinghouse specifically addresses these needs. IRIS is an advanced PWR with integral configuration that yields a simple design with enhanced safety. The IRIS size is 335 MWe and may be deployed in single or multiple modules. It can fit almost any grid. or a small utility within a larger grid; moreover. it allows incremental power additions as needed. The capital outlay is of the order of hundreds of millions rather than a few billions dollars. Successive construction and operation of multiple modules significantly reduces the required capital resources and capital at risk with generation income from earlier plants offsetting the construction outlays of subsequent ones. This is highly desirable in both developed and emerging markets. but it may be of critical importance to the latter. IRIS safety characteristics allow for licensing with a significantly reduced size of emergency zone. a critical feature for small …,True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,1,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21115171,12024364096190207653,/scholar?cites=12024364096190207653,,,0,0,0

The event was initiated by an operator action aimed to prevent the RCP 2 bearing damage. The action consisted of a power reduction. that lasted for 50 minutes. followed by a reactor and a subsequent RCP 2 trip when the reactor power was reduced to 28%. Two minutes after reactor trip. the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) were isolated and the steam dump flow was closed. On the secondary side the Steam Generator (SG) pressure rose until SG 1 Safety Valve (SV) 1 opened. The realistic RELAP5/MOD 3.3 analysis has been performed assuming realistic equipment behavior and operator actions. The comparison of the RELAP5/MOD 3.3 results for the realistic analysis with the measurement has shown small differences for the major parameters (nuclear power. average temperature. secondary pressure) for both power reduction transient (100–28%) and pump trip event.

Among all ATWS accidents. Loss of Normal Feedwater Flow together with Loss of Load accident has the greatest potential for damage to the reactor coolant system boundary. considering pressure peak in the primary coolant system. The analysis of Loss of Normal Feedwater Flow without reactor trip for NPP Krsko is presented in this paper. The calculation was performed for 21st cycle of NPP Krsko using RELAP5/MOD3.3 default point kinetics model and RELAP5/MOD3.3 coupled with PARCS v2.5 reactor kinetics code. In this approach RELAP5 reactivity data were generated in consistent way with PARCS XS data. Two types of the coupled calculations were performed. first with one thermal-hydraulics channel on RELAP5 side in order to be similar to point kinetics calculation and second with detailed thermal-hydraulics model to assess influence of real thermal-hydraulic feedback on primary peak pressure. Comparison of results obtained with point kinetics model and 3D model was made to check applicability of point kinetics calculations and to check if more realistic 3D modeling can bring some additional margin in calculation of peak primary pressure.(author),True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,1,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20793806,14059709992186632477,/scholar?cites=14059709992186632477,,,0,0,0
1152564,RCP seal leakage analysis during station blackout for NPP Krsko,2005,Sinisa Sadek and Srdan Spalj and Nikola Cavlina,,,,,,Reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) are equipped with staged shaft seals which are provided with cooling system designed to maintain seal integrity such that there is a normal (low) seal leakage rate at nominal reactor coolant system (RCS) pressure. For accident sequences in which there is no cooling to the RCP seals (station blackout. SBO). the leakage rate through the seals may increase with time due to degradation of the seal materials when exposed to coolant at elevated RCS temperatures. If make-up to the RCS is also not available. RCS coolant inventory will decrease and the core will begin to uncover and heat-up. which will lead to a core damage. The objective of the SBO analysis was to determine the available time for recovery of RCS make-up prior to core damage. The T/H analyses were done with the modified WOG2000 RCP Seal Leakage Model assumption of increased leakage scenarios starting at 13 minutes. ref. [1]. The time when the core exit temperature reaches 650 {sup 0}C was an indicator of the core damage. This temperature is a criteria for transition from EOPs (Emergency Operating Procedures) to SAMGs (Severe Accident Management Guidelines). ref. [2]. If core exit temperature is greater than 650 {sup 0}C and increasing. then all attempts to restore core cooling have failed. core damage can not be prevented. and the operator should go to the SAMGs. The analyses were performed with RELAP5/MOD3.3 computer code. Three cases regarding RCP seal leakage rate were analyzed (in all the cases initial RCP seal leakage rate was 21 gpm/RCP): 1. leakage rate remained 21 gpm/RCP (1.3x10{sup -3} m{sup 3}/s). 2 …,True,BlHVTw4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,1,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/20802520,4378805003297635288,/scholar?cites=4378805003297635288,,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/20802520,0,0,0

Zavod za sociologiju Filozofskog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Zagrebu,Rizik je oduvijek bio prisutan u društvu. a tehnološkim napretkom društva pojavljuju se i novi. dotad nepostojeći rizici. Stalna prisutnost rizika u društvu praćena je težnjom za sigurnošću. za boljim načinima kontrole i regulacije rizika. Kako se društvo razvijalo. tako je uložen i sve veći trud kako bi život postao sigurniji. odnosno kako bi se rizičnosti svele na što manju mjeru. No. umjesto da zbog toga javnost postaje manje zabrinuta. dio javnosti postaje sve više zabrinut rizikom. Taj dio javnosti smatra kako je društvo izloženije višem stupnju rizika nego što je bilo u prošlosti. te da je situacija svakim danom sve gora. Kako pravilno izabrati između dva različita rizika. dvije različite rizične situacije? Kad se ovo pitanje otvori. ukazuje se veliki nesrazmjer između stručnjaka i javnosti. Stručnjaci rizičnost situacije analiziraju racionalno. analitički. objektivno–i vjeruju da su time došli do stvarnog rizika. Nasuprot tome. smatraju da laici ovise o percepciji rizika. koja je subjektivna. iracionalna. pogrešna i manipulirana. Takvim načinom gledanja govori se o razlikama između stvarnosti i percepciji stvarnosti. No. da li je ispravno analitički određeni rizik smatrati stvarnim. referentnim a percepciju javnosti zanemarivati? Ovako podijeljeni stavovi rezultirali su u konačnici otvorenim neslaganjima i frustracijom između laika i stručnjaka. što je posebice vidljivo u energetici.

Such communities usually use photovoltaic systems on the rooftops of public and private buildings that are connected to a microgrid. Those energy system models represent an electrical network that is decentralized in which energy consumers also become producers (prosumers) and management of the grid is done by users. Optimization and trading of surplus energy produced in microgrids could be done via blockchain technology.

Ovim radom želimo ukazati na činjenicu da se takav model teško politički i ekonomski provodi. au tržišnim uvjetima je neodrživ. Ako lokalna zajednica posjeduje obnovljive energetske resurse tada ih može iskoristiti za svoj vlastiti razvoj ili prepustiti korištenje investitorima izvan zajednice ili pak zajednički investirati. Za korištenje resursa u funkciji vlastitog razvoja mora se pobrinuti lokalna vlast od koje se očekuje da predloži. pokrene i koordinira aktivnosti izgradnje postrojenja za korištenje obnovljivih izvora ali i mjere za uštedu energenata radi mogućnosti povečanja poslovne efikasnosti poduzetnika u svom kraju o kojima u velikoj mjeri ovisi zapošljavanje lokalnog stanovništva.Inovativni modeli investiranja u obnovljive izvore kao što su grupno financiranje izgradnje i zadružni i ESCO modeli mogu postati poluge lokalnog razvoja. Javne tvrtke i ustanove mogu i trebaju biti predvodnici takvog razvoja a građani mogu višak svojih sredstava uložiti u održiva energetska postrojenja i tako sačuvati vrijednost svojih sredstava uz minimalni rizik ali i pridonijeti lokalnom ekonomskom razvoju.

This paper will describe the development of different business models with an emphasis on crowdfunding. Crowdfunding is an alternative way of financing where a group of people funds projects. products. services. or ideas using Internet platforms (Hafner i dr.. 2017). Renewable energy sources are most often financed by a lending model of crowdfunding where many participants contribute small amounts to the project. The ratio of the revenue and the invested amount is defined by contract. There are different types of crowdfunding models: crowd lending. equity crowdfunding. donation-based crowdfunding. reward-based crowdfunding and hybrid models of crowdfunding. One of first EU crowdfunding platforms for renewable energy projects is Citizenergy. With over 54 projects and 36 million€ collected during a period of 2016-2017. Citizenergy has the experience to be an umbrella organization for other crowdfunding platforms. Citizenergy encourages different communities as energy cooperatives and organizations to participate in renewable energy projects.

Because of their prices and impacts. many governments have established support mechanisms to speed up the implementation and investment because of its benefits. It resulted in a share of renewables of over 70% of installed capacities in the energy sector of EU-27. At the same time. despite economic crisis. the number of green jobs recorded its highest level. The purpose of this article is to present a model which assesses middle and long term effects of supporting and investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency. Effects are considered holistically and thus every measure is evaluated by its impact on environment. economy and society through the life-cycle of technology. The model is created to facilitate and ensure best investments in the green energy sector which is still in an early phase of development in Croatia. Effects on environment are evaluated by the reduction of greenhouse gasses. effects on society are evaluated by the number of new jobs created. effects on economy by the rise of GDP. Additionally. financial values for the State were given for every consequence in case the measure was supported by the government. Values are estimated as a difference from the business as a usual scenario. in which measures for supporting renewable energy sources and energy efficiency were not implemented.

In line with scientific findings. the EU’s objective (in the context of necessary reductions by developed countries as a group) is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80%–95% by 2050 compared to 1990. This calls for a deep. rapid transformation of the energy system and an assessment of the role of policy instruments such as carbon pricing for this transition.

1152612,Minimizing cost of energy efficiency savings targets–residential sector’s investment choices,,Marko Matosović,,,,,,In recent years. the importance of modelling individual consumer groups. depending on their socio-economic characteristics. receives an increasing role and is the theme of growing number of studies. The joint conclusion that arises from research is the need to respect the heterogeneity of individual consumer groups and their different preferences that need to be appropriately addressed. One of the conclusions is that it is the diversity of characteristics of consumers that is one of the main market barriers for implementation of energy efficiency measures. This research presents the methodological approach for minimizing the costs of energy efficiency obligated parties by incorporating household consumption characteristics and investment choices into energy efficiency planning and decision model. Used approach is based on the stated preferences survey for including consumer decisions and national energy consumption data for including household characteristics. The decision-making process was modelled via willingness to invest function and applied on the existing family housing stock. By applying the described framework policy makers. energy companies under EEO scheme. or any other subsidy or incentive providing authority aiming to reach specific energy savings target. can obtain the distribution of financial incentives among different consumer groups (ie income classes) which also account for different amounts of energy savings. The developed model provides results of cost and energy saving optimization. ie minimal level of subsidies that is needed to achieve set energy savings goal. or the level of energy savings possible with …,True,wlhoO7EAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://www.bib.irb.hr/935147?rad=935147,,,,,0,0,0

To investigate impacts of living in energy poverty. two sets of field visits and a phone survey have been undertaken (N=394) in Sisak- Moslavina County. Croatia. Data was collected (N=375) on living conditions. energy use and health through a structured survey. The majority of respondents live in uninsulated dwellings (93%) with fuelwood stoves as the only source of heating (78%). Mould and draught are a common sight (57% and 89% respectively). We have found a link between adverse living conditions and poor health proving that current policies are ineffective addressing that issue. During the second round of field visits. all households were provided with simple energy efficiency measures. To test impact of those measures a phone survey (N=60) was undertaken. Respondents have noted improvement in their overall comfort (77%). Significant improvement in quality of life (87%) was attributed to measures implemented.

All mentioned challenges are calling for consideration of    various options (like nuclear. coal. gas or renewable scenarios) and for    better understanding of energy systems modelling in order to optimize proper    energy mix. Existing models are not sufficient any more and planners will    need to think differently in order to face these challenges.

The reasons for the slow introduction of PVs in Croatia are multiple. and they vary from legislative barriers to financial incapability to support this rather expensive technology. In 2007 new legislature for renewables was set. including feed in tariffs for PVs. However. the support for PVs is at the moment limited to a total of 1 MWp installed capacity. This limit seems rather low compared to some countries. such as Spain and Germany. where already installed capacity is few hundred megawatts. Nevertheless. taking into account Croatian limited financial resources 1MWp limit seems to be reasonable to some extent.

U svijetu je u 2012. godini 896 milijuna ljudi živjelo s manje od 1.90 USD (oko 13HRK) na dan. Unatoč brojnim programima koji se provode s ciljem smanjenja općeg siromaštva. preko deset posto svjetske populacije i dalje živi ispod granice ekstremnog siromaštva [1]. Jedan od oblika siromaštva je energetsko siromaštvo. Energetsko siromaštvo se manifestira bilo kroz potpuni izostanak pristupa modernim oblicima energije (npr. električnoj energiji) ili kao nemogućnost podmirenja troškova energije koja je potrebna za osiguranje zdravstveno. društveno i kulturološki prihvatljivih uvjeta stanovanja. U svijetu preko jedne milijarde ljudi još uvijek nema pristup električnoj energiji. a gotovo tri milijarde ovise o ogrjevnom drvu i drugim oblicima biomase za kuhanje i grijanje [2]. U Hrvatskoj se energetsko siromaštvo primarno javlja kao nemogućnost podmirenja troškova. Energetsko siromaštvo predstavlja nemogućnost kućanstva i pojedinaca da si priušte adekvatne osnovne energetske usluge–grijanje. hlađenje. kuhanje. pranje i rasvjetu. Porast cijena energije velik je društveni problem u svim državama Europske unije te time predstavlja i značajan politički problem [1]. a isti je prisutan iu Hrvatskoj.

This kind of façade system has the ability to    increase the energy efficiency and flexibility of buildings. while improving    the quality of the indoor environment. The best way to develop and evaluate    this complex type of building structure is the use of total building    performance simulation in combination with experimental data. The overall    research plan is based on experimental work. the process of validation and    the numerical simulation of the validated model. Thus. the task of this part    of the research is a comparative analysis between the current state of a    building with double skin façades and models with traditional envelope type.    The main question that arises is whether and how the double skin façades may    contribute to the decrease in the energy consumption of the building by    increasing the quality of the thermal comfort of the occupants. The    simulation software tool. EnergyPlus in combination with airflow network    algorithm. is used for modelling and all necessary energy calculations. The    validated model in the analysis is used for comparative evaluation with    models with traditional façades. The simulation results for all the models    analysed assess what their impact is on the energy consumption for heating    and air-conditioning of the building.

Researchers and industry persons can leverage from this big data to make intelligent decisions via deep learning (DL) algorithms. However. the performance of DL algorithms are heavily dependent on the proper selection of parameters. If the hyperparameters are poorly selected. they usually lead to suboptimal results. Traditional approaches include a manual setting of parameters by trial and error methods which is time consuming and difficult process. In this paper. a Bayesian approach based on acquisition is presented to automatic selection of optimal parameters based on provided data. The acquisition function was established to search for the best parameter from the input space and evaluate the next points based on past observations. The tuning process identifies the best model parameters by iterating the objective function and minimizing the loss for optimizable variables such as learning rate and Hidden layersize. To validate the presented approach. we conducted a case study on real-life energy management datasets while constructing a deep learning model on MATLAB platform. A performance comparison was drawn with random parameters and optimal parameters selected by presented approach.

While there are various types of power distribution networks. a recently introduced novel structure of an aromatic network could begin a new era in the distribution levels of power systems and designs of microgrids or smart grids. In order to minimize blackout periods during natural disasters and provide sustainable energy. improve energy efficiency and maintain stability of a distribution network. it is essential to configure/reconfigure the network topology based on its geographical location and power demand. and also important to realize its self-healing function. In this paper. a strategy for reconfiguring aromatic networks based on structures of natural aromatic molecules is explained. Various network structures are designed. and simulations have been conducted to justify the performance of each configuration. It is found that an aromatic network does not need to be fixed in a specific configuration (ie. a DDT structure). which provides flexibility in designing networks and demonstrates that the successful use of such structures will be a perfect solution for both distribution networks and microgrid systems in providing sustainable energy to the end users.,True,ZoPCx7AAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/10/4317,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/12/10/4317/pdf,0,0,0

Exergy refers to the maximum useful work that can be obtained from a system at a given state in a given environment. This implies that the conservation law applies to energy but it is subjected to exergy.

Considering this shortcoming. we propose a feature selection algorithm in gene expression data analysis of sample classifications.

We repeat this process until all subsets are merged into one informative subset. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by analyzing three distinct gene expression data sets.

Despite many modifications with important roles in cellular activity. lysine succinylation has recently emerged as an important PTM mark. It alters the chemical structure of lysines. leading to remarkable changes in the structure and function of proteins. In contrast to the huge amount of proteins being sequenced in the post-genome era. the experimental detection of succinylated residues remains expensive. inefficient and time-consuming. Therefore. the development of computational tools for accurately predicting succinylated lysines is an urgent necessity. To date. several approaches have been proposed but their sensitivity has been reportedly poor.

The implementation of null LDA method is. however. computationally very expensive. In this paper. we theoretically derive the null LDA method from a different perspective and present a computationally efficient implementation of this method. Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of S T+ S B (where S B is the between-class scatter matrix and S T+ is the pseudoinverse of the total scatter matrix S T) is shown here to be a sufficient condition for the null LDA method. As EVD of S T+ S B is computationally expensive. we show that the utilization of random matrix together with S T+ S B is also a sufficient condition for null LDA method.

One of the SDGs (ie. SDG7) suggests that it is necessary to ensure energy access for all. In developing countries like India. the progress toward SDG7 has somewhat stagnated. The aging conventional electric power system has its dominant share of energy from fossil fuels. plagued with frequent power outages. and leaves many un-electrified areas. These are not characteristics of a sustainable and modern system in the context of the SDG7. Promoting renewable-based energy systems. especially in the context of microgrids (MGs). is one of the promising advances needed to rejuvenate the progress toward the SDG7. In this context. a hybrid renewable energy microgrid (HREM) is proposed that gives assurance for energy access to all in an affordable. reliable. and sustainable way through modern energy systems. In this paper. a techno-economic and environmental modeling of the grid-independent HREM and its optimization for a remote community in South India are presented.

This is mainly due to the presence of salts or chemical chlorides that pose a danger to the concrete structures. The determination of the existence of these corrosive salts is vital for defining the service life of concrete. This research looked at developing an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor for the detection of corrosive salts. The first design adopted a single-loop coil (SLC) concept. and the second was based on a multiple-loop coil (MLC) one using copper wire. Tests were conducted on these two techniques. and with the results obtained. the latter seemed more promising; thus. a prototype sensor was developed using the MLC concept. As this new prototype sensor was able to detect the manifestation of chemical contents in a concrete structure. it could be used as a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for the detection of corrosive chemicals in concrete and has the further possibility of detecting corrosion in concrete.

It provides numerous advantages like minimal maintenance. low cost. compactness and no requirement of high-performance power amplifiers. Controlling the rotor position and its displacements under parameter variations during acceleration and deceleration phases was not effective with the use of conventional controllers like proportional–integral–derivative (PID) and fuzzy-type controllers. Hence. to get the robust and stable operation of a bearingless switched reluctance motor (BSRM). a new robust dynamic sliding mode controller has been proposed in this paper. along with a sensorless operation using a sliding ode observer. The rotor displacement tracking error functions and speed tracking error functions are used in the designing of both proposed methods of the sliding mode switching functions. To get a healthy and stable operation of the BSRM. the proposed controller’s tasks are divided into three steps. As a first step. the displaced rotor in any one of the four quadrants in the air gap has to pull back to the centre position successfully. The second step is to run the motor at a rated speed by exciting torque phase currents. and finally. the third step is to maintain the stable and robust operation of the BSRM even under the application of different loads and changes of the motor parameters.

Tsunoda,,,,,,Over the last few decades. the use of electroencephalography (EEG) signals for motor imagery based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) has gained widespread attention. Deep learning have also gained widespread attention and used in various application such as natural language processing. computer vision and speech processing.

However. motor imagery EEG signal feature extraction using CSP generally depends on the selection of the frequency bands to a great extent.

The idea of the proposed method is to utilize the information from all the available channels for effectively selecting the most discriminative filter banks. CSP features are extracted from multiple overlapping sub-bands. An additional sub-band has been introduced that cover the wide frequency band (7–30 Hz) and two different types of features are extracted using CSP and common spatio-spectral pattern techniques. respectively.

The Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) are functional regions within IDPs that undergo a disorder-to-order transition on binding to a partner protein. Identifying MoRFs in IDPs using computational methods is a challenging task. In this study. we introduce hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles to accurately identify the location of MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Using windowing technique. HMM profiles are utilised to extract features from protein sequences and support vector machines (SVM) are used to calculate a propensity score for each residue. Two different SVM kernels with high noise tolerance are evaluated with a varying window size and the scores of the SVM models are combined to generate the final propensity score to predict MoRF residues. The SVM models are designed to extract maximal information between MoRF residues. its neighboring regions (Flanks) and the remainder of the sequence (Others). To evaluate the proposed method. its performance was compared to that of other MoRF predictors; MoRFpred and ANCHOR. The results show that the proposed method outperforms these two predictors.

WSNs generally consist of a large number of sensor nodes and recording the location of each sensor nodes becomes a difficult task. On the other hand. based on the application environment. the nodes may be subject to mobility and their location changes with time. Therefore. a scheme that will autonomously estimate or calculate the position of the sensor nodes is desirable. This paper presents an intelligent localization scheme. which is an artificial neural network (ANN) based localization scheme used to estimate the position of the unknown nodes. In the proposed method. three anchors nodes are used. The mobile or deployed sensor nodes request a beacon from the anchor nodes and utilizes the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of the beacons received. The RSSI values vary depending on the distance between the mobile and the anchor nodes. The three RSSI values are used as the input to the ANN in order to estimate the location of the sensor nodes. A feed-forward artificial neural network with back propagation method for training has been employed. An average Euclidian distance error of 0.70 m has been achieved using a ANN having 3 inputs. two hidden layers. and two outputs (x and y coordinates of the position).,True,H0EvFHYAAAAJ:u9iWguZQMMsC,13,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201431057370026.page,1547847122451583679,/scholar?cites=1547847122451583679,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201431057370026.pdf,0,0,0

Time synchronization is also helpful to save energy in WSN because it provides the possibility to set nodes into the sleeping mode. In wireless sensor networks all of above applications need that all sensor nodes have a common time reference. However. most existing time synchronization protocols are likely to deteriorate or even be destroyed when the WSNs attack by malicious intruders. The recently developed maximum and minimum consensus based time synchronization protocol (MMTS) is a promising alternative as it does not depend on any reference node or network topology. But MMTS is vulnerable to message manipulation attacks. In this thesis. we focus on how to defend the MMTS protocol in wireless sensor networks under message manipulation attacks.

This paper proposes a novel distributed time synchronization protocol for WSNs. which compensates for the nondeterministic delays by estimating the uncertainties in the synchronization packet delays. The main idea is to minimize the uncertainties in the synchronization packet delays to achieve a synchronization scheme that is accurate. efficient and has a low communication overhead. An average per hop synchronization accuracy of 2.4 µs has been achieved.,True,H0EvFHYAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,0,http://modul.repo.mercubuana-yogya.ac.id/modul/files/pkk/OpenJournalOfEconomy/10_117.pdf,,,,http://modul.repo.mercubuana-yogya.ac.id/modul/files/pkk/OpenJournalOfEconomy/10_117.pdf,0,0,0

1152787,A prototype of an electromagnetic induction sensor for non-destructive estimation of the presence of corrosive chemicals ensuing concrete corrosion,2019,Kabir A Mamun and Ravin N Deo and FR Islam and Hemanshu R Pota and Aneesh A Chand and Kushal A Prasad and Aisake Cakacaka,19,Sensors,9,1959,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete often leads to huge unbudgeted expenses for maintaining. monitoring and renovating an infrastructure. This is mainly due to the presence of salts or chemical chlorides that pose a danger to the concrete structures. The determination of the existence of these corrosive salts is vital for defining the service life of concrete. This research looked at developing an electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor for the detection of corrosive salts. The first design adopted a single-loop coil (SLC) concept. and the second was based on a multiple-loop coil (MLC) one using copper wire. Tests were conducted on these two techniques. and with the results obtained. the latter seemed more promising; thus. a prototype sensor was developed using the MLC concept. As this new prototype sensor was able to detect the manifestation of chemical contents in a concrete structure. it could be used as a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for the detection of corrosive chemicals in concrete and has the further possibility of detecting corrosion in concrete.

Currently. the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into the current power generation systems can offer attractive economic and environmental merits. including considerable fuel savings and carbon dioxide emission reductions. In relation to sustainability. efficiency and economic feasibility. solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most promising sources of RESs which is being touted as a leading solution to long-term electrification and development problems in rural and urban parts of Pacific Island Countries (PICs). In this work. a grid-tie PV system is instigated at a residential scale. The idea of this research is not to claim the power output from the PV system but to show the feasibility of a grid-tie system at a residential scale.

The fuel cell system. including all its auxiliaries and related control systems. is emulated by a buck converter realized experimentally and controlled in the DSPACE environment. The realization of the buck converter allows the behaviour of any fuel cells to be easily emulated since only the modification of the control law of the switch is necessary. The proposed emulator can be applied easily to other fuel cell systems if the polarization curve has the same current rate and maximum power. In this way it is possible to utilize the converter and perform the necessary tests to optimize a fuel cell system by avoiding the waste of hydrogen and the purchase of cells as well as any cell damage.

Australia,In multi-robot systems. predefined task allocation and coordination may not always work as desired. This is due to the inability to entirely model all aspects of the robot’s interactions with the environment before task execution. Robots with limited capabilities also present the challenge of how their limited resources should be utilised to achieve the objectives of the global task. This paper presents a task allocation and coordination strategy for mobile robots with limited capabilities. To determine task-robot combinations. task allocation utilises a VOTS that represent a robot’s suitability for a task. Task allocation yields a team of robots comprising task managers and task executers. After task allocation. task executer robots execute the global task. while task manager robots monitor the performance of the global task. If the global task’s performance is not optimal. the task executer robots’ resource utilisation is varied using a feedback coordination mechanism.

The navigation framework shared by the various implementations is described. A multi-layered architecture is employed that incorporates reactive control. deliberative path planning and exploration capabilities. The reactive controller utilises a two-stage optimisation in directional and velocity space. Path planning employs a probabilistic A* algorithm applied to a dynamically-updated occupancy grid. Implementation differences between applications include the path planning cost function. and certain aspects of the reactive control system that are affected by different robot shapes and drive systems. Some key results from both applications are presented. including experiments performed in simulation and in the real world.,True,aIR4jwYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,11,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2007/papers/paper73final.pdf,704632263536802673,/scholar?cites=704632263536802673,,https://www.araa.asn.au/acra/acra2007/papers/paper73final.pdf,0,0,0
1152829,Towards a robust feedback system for coordinating a hierarchical multi-robot system,2014,Praneel Chand and Dale A Carnegie,62,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,2,91-107,North-Holland,Restricting the usage of a team of robots to a few expert human users can be disadvantageous. In applications such as exploration. it may not always be possible for human experts to travel to sites. resulting in negative consequences. It is preferable to have a robotic system that is capable of coordinating itself based on inputs provided by non-expert human users. Hence. this paper presents the development of a robust feedback system for coordinating a hierarchical team of robots where inputs are specified by non-expert human users. Experiments with a multi-robot mapping and exploration task show that the feedback system successfully detects and corrects three types of failures. These are poor performance. partial failure and complete failure. Moreover. the system is robust to threshold value variation and monitor time interval variation within the tested limits.,True,aIR4jwYAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,9,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921889013002273,1446925139369301276,/scholar?cites=1446925139369301276,,,0,0,0
1152830,Development of a reduced human user input task allocation method for multiple robots,2012,Praneel Chand and Dale A Carnegie,60,Robotics and Autonomous Systems,10,1231-1244,North-Holland,Task allocation mechanisms are employed by multi-robot systems to efficiently distribute tasks between different robots. Currently. many task allocation methods rely on detailed expert knowledge to coordinate robots. However. it may not be feasible to dedicate an expert human user to a multi-robot system. Hence. a non-expert user may have to specify tasks to a team of robots in some situations. This paper presents a novel reduced human user input multi-robot task allocation technique that utilises Fuzzy Inference Systems (FISs). A two-stage primary and secondary task allocation process is employed to select a team of robots comprising manager and worker robots. A multi-robot mapping and exploration task is utilised as a model task to evaluate the task allocation process. Experiments show that primary task allocation is able to successfully identify and select manager robots.

However. in certain applications. these memory constrained robots may need to perform global path planning to navigate beyond their local region. A two-tiered path planning technique based on the A* algorithm is presented to facilitate successful global path planning. The technique involves initially dividing a large global map into smaller local maps whose size is determined by the robot’s memory capacity. Following this. a path to the destination is planned by searching the local maps using a two-tiered A* algorithm. The effect of local map size on the path length and planning time is investigated for different global map sizes and obstacle densities.,True,aIR4jwYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7,http://repository.usp.ac.fj/5680/,8025228068528154515,/scholar?cites=8025228068528154515,,,0,0,0

1152838,Development of an artificial intelligence system for the instruction and control of cooperating mobile robots,2011,Praneel Chand,3,,,,Universal-Publishers,This thesis focuses on the development of an artificial intelligence system for a heterogeneous ensemble of mobile robots. Many robots in the ensemble may have limited processing. communication. sensing. and/or actuation capabilities. This means that each robot may not be able to execute all tasks that are input to the system. A hierarchical system is proposed to permit robots with superior processing and communication abilities to assign tasks and coordinate the less computationally able robots. The limited processing robots may also utilise the resources of superior robots during task execution. Effective task allocation and coordination should result in efficient execution of a global task. Many existing approaches to robot task allocation assume expert knowledge for task specification. This is not ideal if a non-expert human user wants to modify the task requirements.A novel reduced human user input task allocation and feedback coordination technique for limited capability mobile robots is developed and implemented. Unlike existing approaches. the presented method focuses on expressing tasks and robots in terms of processing. communication. sensing. and actuation physical resources. This has the potential to allow non-expert human users to specify tasks to the team of robots. Fuzzy inference systems are utilised to simplify detailed robot information for comparison with simple human user inputs that represent task resource requirements. Like many existing task allocation methods. a greedy algorithm is employed to select robots. This can result in suboptimal task allocation.

Carnegie,,,,481 - 486,IEEE,In some multi-robot applications. such as exploration. predefined task allocation and coordination can fail to function adequately. This failure is attributed to the inability to completely model a robot's interactions with the environment before task execution. Hence. the main focus of this paper is on a feedback coordination mechanism that executes periodically after initial task allocation. This feedback mechanism monitors the individual and group performance of worker robots. If the performance of a worker robot is unsatisfactory. a task reallocation algorithm adjusts the task-robot combinations of the team. Three cases of unsatisfactory robot performance that can be detected by the feedback mechanism include: complete failure. partial failure and poor performance.

1152840,The design of a pair of identical mobile robots to investigate cooperative behaviours,2005,Dale A Carnegie and Andrew D Payne and Praneel Chand,,Cutting Edge Robotics–Section V Multi-Robot Systems,,377-396,,When moving large or heavy items. the traditional tendency with machinery is to build a large mechanism capable of handling the load. This leads to continuous scaling of the mechanical size and weight of devices being built. with a proportional increase in expense. An alternative to this conventional trend is the use of cooperative behaviour. Humans are limited by their physical size and strength–and yet are capable of moving heavy furniture and other large items outside their individual strength ability. This is accomplished with the help of another person to share the load. or a large number of people for a substantial object.Requirements of coordination. communication and precision control have restricted this approach being considered for mobile robots in the past. However. more powerful processors and software are removing these barriers. permitting cooperative robots to be seriously considered for a number of applications. By working in parallel. cooperative behaviour can increase efficiency and reduce the time required to complete a task. Reliability is increased by introducing redundancy when using a team of robots. while cost is reduced due to the use of smaller simplistic machine designs. Application specific design and manufacturing costs can be removed by fabricating the robots semi-generically. Reduced weight means less preparation and upkeep of the working environment. and new complex tasks can be introduced which are too difficult for a single entity to achieve.,True,aIR4jwYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,6,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JNEn23UyHuAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA377&dq=info:PudY-Dr_ydUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=yotY9e4dt5&sig=5WnKNinWH18qtg4ICXcQoQcCMV8,15405124629137254206,/scholar?cites=15405124629137254206,,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=JNEn23UyHuAC&oi=fnd&pg=PA377&dq=info:PudY-Dr_ydUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=yotY9e4dt5&sig=5WnKNinWH18qtg4ICXcQoQcCMV8,0,0,0

The large number of interrelated parameters that influence the cutting forces (cutting speed. feed. depth of cut. primary and secondary cutting edge angles. rake angle. nose radius. clearance angle. cutting edge inclination angle. cutting tool wear. physical and chemical characteristics of the machined part. etc.) makes it extremely difficult to develop a proper model. Although an enormous amount of cutting force related data is available in machining handbooks. most of them attempt to define the relationship between a few of the possible cutting parameters whilst fixing the other parameters. Also. proper mechanisms for extracting general models from existing machining data are still to be developed. In this paper an approach for modeling cutting forces with the help of artificial neural networks is proposed.

1152852,Automatic cutting-tool condition monitoring on CNC lathes,1998,Tamas Szecsi,77,Journal of Materials Processing Technology,1-3,64-69,Elsevier,This paper addresses the problem of automatically defining cutting-tool wear on CNC lathes. The problem is solved by analysing the axial force during the pressing of the cutting edge of an insert into the workpiece while the cutting process is stopped. During machining the feed movement is interrupted and the position of the cutting tool at this moment becomes a reference point. With no feed movement the rotation of the workpiece continues for a few revolutions. the cutting edge being moved off the transient surface in the axial direction. after which the rotation stops. With slow axial movement the cutting edge is pressed into the surface of the workpiece and at the same time the pressing depth relative to the reference point and the axial force are measured. Analysis of the results shows a close relationship between the axial force. measured at a fixed pressing depth and the flank wear of the cutting tool.

1152874,Investigating the possibilities of compensating systematic errors of three-coordinate touch probes using contact signal,2017,D Dimitrov and V Karachorova and V Mihov and T Szecsi,13,Procedia Manufacturing,,450-457,Elsevier,During inspection with three-coordinate touch probes. working on the principle of a kinematic resistance system. the total measuring error called backlash has a negative effect on the measurement accuracy. In order to eliminate the effect of backlash. many companies offer various solutions. As an alternative solution. a new system with improved design of the touch probe and is based on the principle of electrical contacts has been developed. The capabilities and limitations of this new touch probe are analysed in this paper. It is shown that the improved design can reduce the fluctuation of the dislodging force caused by the change of the direction of the force. and the addition of the contact system makes it possible to define the systematic measurement errors.,True,ZxHXO9MAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978917306868,13743528352087233228,/scholar?cites=13743528352087233228,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978917306868/pdf?md5=6b5d21b3c6512b9b29a173bac1f0b265&pid=1-s2.0-S2351978917306868-main.pdf,0,0,0

The design is carried out within a large-scale Markov jump parameter systems framework. Using an integral quadratic constraints description for system interconnections and disturbances. we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decentralized controller which stabilizes the overall system and guarantees its optimal robust performance.,True,xn4pt7QAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,116,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207170500105384,8065526290933472240,/scholar?cites=8065526290933472240,,,0,0,0

Ltd.,This paper presents a novel application of backstepping controller for autonomous landing of a rotary wing UAV (RUAV). This application. which holds good for the full flight envelope control. is an extension of a backstepping algorithm for general rigid body velocity control. The nonlinear RUAV model used in this paper includes the flapping and servo dynamics. The backstepping‐based controller takes advantage of the ‘decoupling’ of the translation and rotation dynamics of the rigid body. resulting in a two‐step procedure to obtain the RUAV control inputs. The first step is to compute desired thrusts and flapping angles to achieve the commanded position and the second step is to compute control inputs. which achieve the desired thrusts and flapping angles. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the inclusion of a flapping angle correction term in control.

The goal is to find the minimum size of battery storage and its corresponding location in the network based on the size and place of the integrated solar generation.

So. it is necessary to use anthropometric data to design the school furniture. Students spend about more than five hours per day at school with little or no breaks. Most classroom activities involve sitting for long period of time. Due to prolonged sitting on inappropriate classroom furniture. students feel back pain and other musculoskeletal disorders. Every effort should be made to ensure that students do not face this problem. In Bangladesh. an anthropometry survey indicated that the furniture used by students. were not manufactured according to ergonomics principle. So. the purpose of this study is to compare furniture dimensions within three different primary schools with the anthropometric measurements of the Bangladeshi students. in order to evaluate the potential mismatch between them.

Manufacturing features like holes. slots. pockets. edge chamfers and keyways are widely used for machining applications. Design functionality is one of the key factors to design a product through a feature based system. A designed product may be rejected during the manufacturing process not only due to the violation of design for manufacture rules but also due to functionality problems. In this paper. design functionality rules for feature based applications are described. These rules are incorporated into a hierarchical feature library.,True,j6-ll4kAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJCAET.2011.040047,,,,,0,0,0
1152947,Development of a manufacturing feature-based design system,2010,ASM Hoque,,,,,,Traditional CAD systems are based on the serial approach of the product development cycle: the design process is not integrated with other activities and thus it can not provide information for subsequent phases of product development. In order to eliminate this problem. many modern CAD systems allow the composition of designs from building blocks of higher level of abstraction called features. Although features used in current systems tend to be named after manufacturing processes. they do not. in reality. provide valuable manufacturing data. Apart from the obvious disadvantage that process engineers need to re-evaluate the design and capture the intent of the designer. this approach also prohibits early detection of possible manufacturing problems.  This research attempts to bring the design and manufacturing phases together by implementing manufacturing features. A design is composed entirely in a bottom-up manner using manufacturable entities in the same way as they would be produced during the manufacturing phase. Each feature consists of parameterised geometry. manufacturing information (including machine tool. cutting tools. cutting conditions. fixtures. and relative cost information). design limitations. functionality rules. and design-for-manufacture rules. The designer selects features from a hierarchical feature library. Upon insertion of a feature. the system ensures that no functionality or manufacturing rules are violated. If a feature is modified. the system validates the feature by making sure that it remains consistent with its original functionality and design-for-manufacture rules are re-applied.

When partial shading occurs the system has multiple-peak output power characteristics. In order to track the global maximum power point (GMPP) within an appropriate period a reliable technique is required. Conventional techniques such as hill climbing and perturbation and observation (P&O) are inadequate in tracking the GMPP subject to this condition resulting in a dramatic reduction in the efficiency of the PV system. Recent artificial intelligence methods have been proposed. however they have a higher computational cost. slower processing time and increased oscillations which results in further instability at the output of the PV system. This paper proposes a fast and efficient technique based on Radial Movement Optimization (RMO) for detecting the GMPP under partial shading conditions. The paper begins with a brief description of the behavior of PV systems under partial shading conditions followed by the introduction of the new RMO-based technique for GMPP tracking. Finally. results are presented to demonstration the performance of the proposed technique under different partial shading conditions. The results are compared with those of the PSO method. one of the most widely used methods in the literature. Four factors. namely convergence speed. efficiency (power loss reduction). stability (oscillation reduction) and computational cost. are considered in the comparison with the PSO technique.

1152973,The rise and fall of gluten!,2015,Imran Aziz and Federica Branchi and David S Sanders,74,,3,221-226,Cambridge University Press,Mankind has existed for 2·5 million years but only in the last 10 000 years have we been exposed to wheat. Wheat was first cultivated in the Fertile Crescent (South Western Asia) with a farming expansion that lasted from about 9000BC to 4000BC. Thus it could be considered that wheat (and gluten) is a novel introduction to man's diet! Prior to 1939 the rationing system had already been devised. This led to an imperative to try to increase agricultural production. Thus it was agreed in 1941 that there was a need to establish a Nutrition Society. The very roots of the society were geared towards necessarily increasing the production of wheat. This goal was achieved and by the end of the 20th century. global wheat output had expanded 5-fold. Perhaps as a result the epidemiology of coeliac disease (CD) or gluten sensitive enteropathy has changed.

1152992,Hybrid renewable energy microgrid for a residential community: a techno-economic and environmental perspective in the context of the SDG7,2020,Nallapaneni Manoj Kumar and Shauhrat S Chopra and Aneesh A Chand and Rajvikram Madurai Elavarasan and GM Shafiullah,12,Sustainability,10,3944,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Energy. being a prime enabler in achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). should be affordable. reliable. sustainable. and modern. One of the SDGs (ie. SDG7) suggests that it is necessary to ensure energy access for all. In developing countries like India. the progress toward SDG7 has somewhat stagnated. The aging conventional electric power system has its dominant share of energy from fossil fuels. plagued with frequent power outages. and leaves many un-electrified areas. These are not characteristics of a sustainable and modern system in the context of the SDG7. Promoting renewable-based energy systems. especially in the context of microgrids (MGs). is one of the promising advances needed to rejuvenate the progress toward the SDG7. In this context. a hybrid renewable energy microgrid (HREM) is proposed that gives assurance for energy access to all in an affordable. reliable. and sustainable way through modern energy systems. In this paper. a techno-economic and environmental modeling of the grid-independent HREM and its optimization for a remote community in South India are presented. A case of HREM with a proposed configuration of photovoltaic/wind turbine/diesel generator/battery energy storage system (PV/WT/DG/BESS) was modeled to meet the community residential electric load requirements.

1153012,Smith predictor based sliding mode control for a class of unstable processes,2017,Utkal Mehta and Rubén Rojas,39,Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control,5,706-714,SAGE Publications,A strategy to regulate unstable processes using a modified Smith predictor based sliding mode controller (SP-SMC) is illustrated. The proposed scheme presents disturbance rejection and optimal control input usage with overall improved regulatory performances. The unstable process with time delay is first estimated using a simple measurement of limit cycle output obtained from a modified relay experiment. Then this paper extends a work on SP-SMC for unstable processes. which leads to significant improvements in its regulatory capacities of reference inputs and disturbances.

There are many empirical features in this algorithm such as continuous number categorization. missing value handling. etc. However in many cases it takes more processing time and provides less accuracy rate for correctly classified instances. On the other hand. a large dataset might contain hundreds of attributes. We need to choose most related attributes among them to perform higher accuracy using C4. 5. It is also a difficult task to choose a proper algorithm to perform efficient and perfect classification. With our proposed method. we select the most relevant attributes from a dataset by reducing input space and simultaneously improve the performance of this algorithm. The improved performance is measured based on better accuracy and less computational complexity. We measure Entropy of Information Theory to identify the central attribute for a dataset. Then apply correlation coefficient measure namely. Pearson’s. Spearman. Kendall correlation utilizing the central attribute of the same dataset. We conduct a comparative study using these three most popular correlation coefficient measures to choose the best method on eight well known data mining problem from UCI (University of California Irvine) data repository.

Since solar light is a promising abundant resource. the development of an efficient photovoltaic cell is attractive. Since the conventional solar cells consist of a semiconductor material with a fixed band gap. they can use a limited region of the solar light spectrum. and thus. their efficiency is rather low. In order to improve the efficiency of a solar cell. a novel concept of an enhanced photo-sensor for photovoltaic application using area arrayed graphene nano ribbon (GNR) was proposed. Graphene exhibits superconductive properties with zero band gap in its original structure. however. the band gap of graphene starts to open when it is cut into a ribbon with the width thinner than 70 nm. and it shows semiconductive properties. The amplitude of the band gap is a strong function of the width of graphene nano-ribbon (GNR). Using area-arrayed GNRs with different width. it is possible to develop a new photo-sensor with enhanced photosensitivity. The key parameter for this design is the alignment of plural GNRs with different band gap.

1153080,Production of coated and free-standing engineering components using the HVOF (High Velocity Oxy-Fuel) process,2003,Joseph Stokes,,,,,,The present study aims to establish the potential of producing various hard metal industrial thick components using the High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray process. rather than by sintering or casting techniques currently used. It is innovative in that generally research work earned out on this process focuses on coating technologies. In order to spray-form thick tungsten carbide cobalt (WC-Co) components. certain problems have to be overcome. More specifically these problems include minimizing residual stresses (which cause shape distortion in the components). therefore maintaining the integrity of the deposit on a microstructural scale.  Residual stress arises during deposition and. in the present research. was reduced by limiting the rise and fluctuation of the deposition temperature. This was achieved by the utilization of a carbon dioxide cooling system and automated traverse movement of the spray gun. which together enabled continuous deposition at a steady temperature of 500°C. reducing the residual stress by 58% compared to manual spraying. A spraying distance of 200mm and a powder feed rate of 38gmm 1 exhibited the lowest stress within the deposit using the automated system.  The minimization of the residual stress increased the maximum deposit thickness achieved from 0 6mm to 1 2mm. Higher deposit thicknesses were achieved when the deposition area was reduced. These findings were simulated by the finite element analysis technique The present research describes the successful production of 9mm thick spray-formed WC-Co components (12mm m diameter) Associative work in this thesis includes the …,True,qc_nDqMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,28,http://doras.dcu.ie/18232/,15634555126494119329,/scholar?cites=15634555126494119329,,http://doras.dcu.ie/18232/1/Joseph_Stokes.pdf,0,0,0

Anaerobic digestion (AD) fulfils the requirements for a sustainable alternative fuel. and is also an environmentally friendly waste treatment method. It requires less energy than other methods such as gasification or pyrolysis due to its low operating temperature. Whiskey distillery and brewery waste streams are classed as high strength organic wastes due to their high BOD/COD content. thus rendering them a suitable feedstock for anaerobic digestion.

In atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) one of many plasma spray methods. a coated layer is formed on a substrate surface by spraying melted powders onto a substrate at a high speed using a high-temperature plasma jet [2. 3]. Powder grains are transported within a carrier gas at hightemperature and high speed. injected into plasma jet. The melting powder is transferred to the substrate surface being coated and after impact. lamellar layer formation occurs [4]. Optimization of spray parameters is important for obtaining high-quality coating. In conventional plasma spray coatings. Argon (Ar) is used as the carrying gas. However. oxygen is also used as carrier gas in hightemperature plasma jet for the metal oxide powders to minimize decomposition of the metal oxide powder and the plasma coated material. as it improves the heat transfer characteristics of plasma during the spraying process [5]. Insufficient melting can occur if powder particles are too large. Optimum grain size and distribution affect the melting point of the material. the spray system used and application method of the coating [6]. In previous studies. it was determined that the microstructure of the coating material depending not only on the characteristics of the thermal spray powder but also on the hot spraying conditions [7-9].Al2O3.

One of the main advantages of this technology is the utilization of such systems in cooling/heating applications where the air is the heat transfer fluid (HTF). Generally. the heat transfer rate in a LHTS unit and its efficiency depends on the difference between the melting temperature of the PCM and the HTF temperature. If a single PCM is used. the temperature difference between the PCM and the HTF along the flow direction will be decreased. This leads to a decrease in the heat transfer rate and efficiency. In this case. nearly a constant temperature difference between the PCM and the HTF can be maintained during phase change. Therefore. the heat transfer rate to/from the PCM is constant.

The Brownian motion effect is considered in predicting the nanofluid properties. The governing equations are solved using the finite volume method with the SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm. The studied parameters are the Rayleigh number (1000≤ Ra≤ 15.000). Hartman number (0≤ Ha≤ 45). nanofluid volume fraction (0≤ φ≤ 0.06). and the cavity aspect ratio (0.1≤ AR≤ 0.7). The results have shown that the nanoparticles volume fraction enhances the natural convection but undesirably increases the entropy generation rate. It is also found that the applied magnetic field can suppress both the natural convection and the entropy generation rate. where for Ra= 1000 and φ= 0.04. the percentage reductions in total entropy generation decreases from 96.27% to 48.17% for Ha= 45 compared to zero magnetic field when the aspect ratio is increased from 0.1 to 0.7. The results of performance criterion have shown that the nanoparticles addition can be useful if a compromised magnetic field value represented by a Hartman number of 30 is applied.

The results showed that any increase in the NP volume concentration enhances the average Nusselt number (N u) and the normalized entropy generation. and reduces the thermal performance of the cavity in all orientations of the hot block. The maximum enhancement in cooling performance was 17.75% and occurred in the right-oriented hot block in the sand-based porous cavity. Furthermore. adding the NP to the base fluid leads to a more capable cooling system and enhances the irreversibility of the process.

The new methodology was developed and validated in a numerical modeling and then applied to propane autoignition experiments to determine the adiabatic ignition delay of the fuel. the so-called measured adiabatic ignition delay. Propane ignition delays were measured in a wide range of low to intermediate gas temperatures ranging from 769 to 952 K. at pressures of 23–30 bar. and at equivalence ratios of approximately 0.5 and 1.0 for a rapid compression machine (RCM).

Then combined heat transfer medium is modeled by adding infrared radiation terms. The parameters which investigated are final surface temperature. final water content. heating time and radiation effects on them have been studied by various penetration depth (wavelength) and different input powers. The results show by increasing penetration depth in shorter wave length. heating time reduced and final surface temperature and core final water content also decreased that it demonstrated a necessity for a balance between them for high quality product.

A literature survey showed that the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) is the most widely used method. although there are other methods that showed better performance. Moreover. it was found in the literature that artificial intelligence methods have been widely used for predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Thus. in the present study. genetic algorithms (GAs) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been utilized to search and determine the antecedent and consequent parameters of the ANFIS model. Solid concentration and temperature were considered as input variables. and thermal conductivity. dynamic viscosity. heat transfer performance. and pumping power in both the internal laminar and turbulent flow regimes were the outputs. In order to evaluate and compare the performance of the models. two statistical indices of root mean square error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R) were utilized. Based on the results. both of the models are able to predict the thermophysical properties appropriately. However. the ANFIS-PSO model had a better performance than the ANFIS-GA model.

The most distinct manner is storing the values of dependent variables in the same set of nodes and using the identical control volumes for all variables. Such a grid is called Collocated. Collocated grid arrangement has many positive results in problems with complex solving range. especially with discontinuous boundary conditions. But this arrangement was not used for a long time for incompressible flow due to pressure and velocity isolation problems and creation of fluctuations in pressure. So the researchers in the mid-60s. have developed a new arrangement to reduce this isolation and increase the coupling between pressure and velocity. This new arrangement called staggered grid. provided the field of a new method for solving fluid flow problems called SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equation) algorithm. This report presents the solution to the continuity. Navier-Stokes equations. Standard fundamental methods like SIMPLER and primary variable formulation have been utilized.

Many models have been developed to predict the flash point using the DIPPR database. However. for only 740 of the 1628 organic compounds available in the DIPPR database. the data for both flash point and normal boiling point were experimentally determined.

1153277,Numerical calculation of fluid induced forces in shell-and-tube heat exchangers,2009,B Ghadiri Dehkordi and H Houri Jafari,,,,,,An understanding of flow fields through tube bundles is needed to accurately calculate the flow behaviour and flow-induced forces in heat exchangers. In this study. the finite volume method was used to analyze flow field through tube bundles with circular cylinders. A hybrid scheme with a Cartesian-staggered grid was used for spatial discretization. A ghost cell technique was used to enforce the no-slip condition on the surface of the embedded boundaries. The study used a semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) algorithm in order to optimize the convergence rate. A great-source-term technique was used to set flow field values on an arbitrary grid point. The pressure drag coefficient. fraction drag coefficient. total drag and angle of separation in the flow around a single circular cylinder were summarized in 4 different grid sizes. Two different flow patterns were observed. It was concluded that external patterns for the square arrangement are unsteady with irregular vortex shedding. while internal patterns are steady and do not change with time. 8 refs.. 2 tabs.. 3 figs.,True,de5e2n4AAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,3,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21214035,15048310033943355669,/scholar?cites=15048310033943355669,,,0,0,0

In this study nonlinear 2D wind is estimated. Nonlinear damping and stiffness with freeplay in plunging and pitching motion is assumed. 2nd order Damping nonlinearity and 3rd order stiffness nonlinearity in pitching and plunging motion is assumed. Fully nonlinear structure with nonlinear 3rd order piston theory aerodynamic is assumed for the first time and result evaluated with different references.

They are solved in the state space via the ruge-kuta numerical method to determine chaotic and limit cycle oscillation motion of supersonic airfoil. The result show that as the speed increases. the behavior of 2D wing is softening type with the use of nonlinear rotational stiffness. But. It shows hardening type with the use of transversal nonlinear stiffness. The effect of transversal and rotational freeplay is more complicated than other parameters and increases instability in low speed. In other hand the stability increases with freeplay in high speed.

The requirements of numerical simulation in order to resolve turbulent spectra around the blade are studied. According to the fact that most of unsteady aerodynamic phenomena incept from blades leading edge. and the role of this part in types and intensity of instabilities. the goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of changes in radius of leading edge of airfoil on flow phenomena in different scales of wave numbers. The governing equations of flow-field are solved using different numerical approaches. Resolution characteristics of different modeling and simulation techniques are investigated. The primary geometry of blade uses a standard NACA-65 series airfoil. which has been tolerated by 50% variation in circular leading edge radius. Mesh requirements of flow simulation for intended purposes are studied in detail and some recommendations are proposed to be implemented in numerical aeroelastic simulations. Accuracy and fidelity of LES results are studied with extraction of power spectra around the blade and the portion of resolved energy is also estimated. Results suggest that the order of accuracy and grid density highly affect the small-scale flow phenomena.

A frequency and flutter analysis of flat and curved plate under in-plane loads and thermal effects for the structure with temperature dependent properties has been performed. The first order piston theory is deployed to model supersonic aerodynamic loading. The system of non-linear PDE equations has been derived using the Hamilton principle and transformed into a set of non-linear ODE equations via the Galerkin method. By transforming the equations into the state space form and defining the proposed Jacobian matrix. eigenvalue analysis has been performed. The frequency and flutter analyses of a curved plate show that the effects of different environmental loadings are noticeable and have been carried out for the first time.

Flows through the heat exchanger are mostly two phase flow like air-water. vapor-water or Freon. Two phase numerical methods are quite complicated because of some parameters like VOF and interaction between two phases. Experimental studies are another problem and costly. Therefore. numerical methods are very important for studying two phase flow.

Interactions between the fluid and the structure have been counted in a fully coupled manner. HEM was used for analyzing two phase flow. In HEM method there is no difference in velocity between gas and fluid.

A finite element code is developed to model two-dimensional Timoshenko beams using the extended Hamilton's principle. The effects of each section length and distributed and concentrated mass on the type of the instability and the critical follower force have been studied for different models of beams. It is concluded that when mass of last section is subsided. the magnitude and the type of instability changes significantly and in most cases it decrease. It is observed that change in rotary inertia parameter of Timoshenko beam and the rotary inertia of concentrated masses affect the magnitude and the type of instability.

The authors propose a formulation where the original surfaces are divided into a grid of elementary areas and Stokes’ theorem is applied for the determination of the view factors between these elementary areas. With this approach. the account of the shading effect of obstructions is significantly improved. The capabilities of the proposed formulation were tested with the calculation of radiative view factors between flat and curved surfaces.

For this purpose a field survey was carried out and the measurements took place in industrial units-five industries and nineteen workplaces were considered–so all the results are based on real working conditions. In order to assess the level of heat exposure the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index and the Predicted Heat Strain (PHS) model. defined in ISO Standards 7243 (1989) and 7933 (2004). respectively. were used. According to the WBGT index. the results show that almost 80% of the workplaces under analysis are prone to heat stress conditions. If the PHS model is considered. the results highlight that the predicted and the maximum sweat rates present equal values in about 40% of the workplaces. In addition. in almost 25% of the workplaces the estimated rectal temperature was higher than 38ºC. just for an exposure period of one hour.

The experimental setup also includes a helical fan from Sodeca (type 90/50) to create flows with different air velocities and a radiative heat source with 14 lamps from Philips. type 13117. positioned at different distances from the temperature sensor.ResultsThe analysis of the results considers the response time. the temperature difference between globes and the influence of the air velocity. For the 50 mm globe the response times ranged between 9 and 44 minutes while for the 150 mm globes the values varied from 12 to 48 minutes. The temperature differences between globes are sometimes significant. In the case of the difference between the globe from Testo and the 50 mm globe the lowest difference was 7.5 C while the highest was 21.7 C. The analysis of the influence of the air velocity shows that the highest temperature difference between the 150 and 50 mm globes always corresponded to a velocity of 0.5 ms-1. then decreasing for higher air velocities.DiscussionThe literature suggests that the globe sensors response time is usually between 20 and 30 minutes.

The results were compared with the Fick’s diffusion model assuming a convective boundary condition enabling the determination of an effective diffusion coefficient and of the mass transfer coefficient on the product’s surface.

It has been reported that edible seaweeds are rich in proteins. lipids and dietary fibers. Moreover. they have plenty of bioactive molecules that can be applied in nutraceutical. pharmaceutical and cosmetic areas. There are historical registers of harvest and cultivation of seaweeds but with the increment of the studies of seaweeds and their valuable compounds. their aquaculture has increased. The methodology of cultivation varies from onshore to offshore. Seaweeds can also be part of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA). which has great opportunities but is also very challenging to the farmers.

1153372,Modelling of fiber suspensions flow in pipes,2016,Carla Isabel Pires Cotas,,,,,,In this thesis the flow behaviour of pulp fiber suspensions is investigated. A central issue in pulp and paper mills is related to high energy costs. some of them due to not proper equipment design. One of the main source is related to the pulp transport systems and the main reason for that is the use of empirical correlations out of their range of applicability. Additionally. different grades of pulp consistency as well as mean flow velocity are present during the industrial process. Even if the process stages are based on the same principles. the final product can have different properties depending on process conditions. Therefore. experimental and numerical methods in the area of flow monitoring of pulp fibre suspensions are increasingly important. Aiming to gain more knowledge concerning flow of pulp suspensions. the applicability of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) strategies to predict pulp’s flow was the main motivation for this work.  In this context. a Newtonian homogeneous single-phase model was chosen as start point. Additionally. a pseudo-homogeneous strategy was followed since high consistency range is of interest. In general. two main factors contribute for the complex behaviour of pulp suspensions in relation to other multiphase systems: fiber suspensions behave as non-Newtonian fluids and the presence of fibers in the flow induces a drag reduction effect.  As a first approach. the non-Newtonian behaviour of pulp suspensions was implemented by relating viscosity to shear rate as a power-law. A very thin pure water annulus surrounding the flow core region was considered.

Also. the existence of a water annulus at the pipe wall. surrounding the core flow. was considered. A low-Reynolds-number k-ε turbulence model was evaluated to describe the presence of the drag reduction effect. Furthermore. the turbulence model was modified taking into account damping functions applied successfully in literature to study power-law fluid flows and particulate flows. which. nevertheless failed to describe adequately the flow of the present complex systems. Therefore. further modifications to the damping function for the case of fibre suspensions were investigated. Pressure drop was used as a control parameter to validate the CFD model.

Order release mechanisms have been developed through simulations that neglect job size variation effects while empirical evidence suggests groups of small/large jobs are often found in practice.

In response. this study assesses the performance of four of the best-performing release methods from the literature in a job shop with sequence-dependent set-up times by simulation. First. the four methods are compared without considering set-up requirements at release. Second. the methods are refined to consider set-up requirements before being compared against the original methods. A release method that combines continuous and periodic release emerges as the best-performing method.

Its customer enquiry management methodology supports due date setting. while its order release mechanism determines when to start production. For make-to-order companies. due date setting is a strategically important. complex task where unconfirmed jobs place demands on capacity which are contingent on a quotation being accepted by the customer. Yet most prior WLC research has begun at the order release stage with a set of confirmed orders with predetermined due dates. In contrast. this paper focuses specifically on customer enquiry management and uses simulation to compare and contrast the performance of 11 due date setting rules in a job shop where part of the workload consists of unconfirmed or contingent orders.

Although simulation has shown WLC can improve job shop performance. field researchers have encountered significant implementation challenges. One of the most notable challenges is the presence of ‘assembly job shops’ where product structures are more complex than typically modelled in simulation and where the final product consists of several sub-assemblies (or work orders) which have to be co-ordinated. WLC theory has not been developed sufficiently to handle such contexts. and the available literature on assembly job shops is limited.

Several release methods have been proposed and evaluated in the WLC literature. A major criterion to distinguish between release methods is whether they take the release decision at periodic time intervals or continuously. This paper aims at improving WLC order release by incorporating a starvation avoidance trigger into continuous release. Using simulation. we demonstrate that significant performance improvements in terms of mean tardiness and standard deviation of lateness can be obtained.

Based on the logistic process involved. kanban systems can be divided into constant order-quantity and constant order-cycle systems. The former has received much research attention. but the latter. also known as a milk run. has been relatively neglected. Further. most prior work has been based on deterministic data. which is an assumption often violated in practice. We present the case of a manufacturer of domestic water heating equipment where a constant order-cycle kanban implementation initially failed. A structured Define–Measure–Analyse–Improve–Control approach is adopted to improve the process. It was revealed that the failure was due to high variability in the logistic processes involved.

We use simulation to assess the performance of four of the best-performing WLC order release methods.

For the realization of the proposed control approach. the tank circuit of the resonant inverter is made up of several tank capacitors that are switched into or out of the tank circuit by electromechanical switches. By digitally modulating the tank capacitance. the output voltage changes in steps. The regulation of output voltage between two adjacent steps is achieved by slightly varying the pulse frequency.

The increase in electricity demand is mainly due to industrialization and the shift from a conventional to a smart-grid paradigm. The number of microgrids. renewable energy sources. plug-in electric vehicles and energy storage systems have also risen in recent years. As a result. future electricity grids have to be revamped and adapt to increasing load levels. Thus. new complications associated with future electrical power systems and technologies must be considered. Demand-side management (DSM) programs offer promising solutions to these issues and can considerably improve the reliability and financial performances of electrical power systems. This paper presents a review of various initiatives. techniques. impacts and recent developments of the DSM of electrical power systems. The potential benefits derived by implementing DSM in electrical power networks are presented.

Analytical and finite element techniques are employed to predict the airgap flux density distribution. the cogging torque and emf waveforms. and the winding inductances. It is shown that the coil mmf vectors influence the coil pitch and distribution factors. and that this leads to significant differences in both the phase and line emf waveforms and also the self and mutual inductances. Predicted results are validated on two experimental motors.

1153461,Impact of demand-side management on the reliability of generation systems,2018,Hussein Jumma Jabir and Jiashen Teh and Dahaman Ishak and Hamza Abunima,11,Energies,8,2155,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The load shifting strategy is a form of demand side management program suitable for increasing the reliability of power supply in an electrical network. It functions by clipping the load demand that is above an operator-defined level. at which time is known as peak period. and replaces it at off-peak periods. The load shifting strategy is conventionally performed using the preventive load shifting (PLS) program. In this paper. the corrective load shifting (CLS) program is proven as the better alternative. PLS is implemented when power systems experience contingencies that jeopardise the reliability of the power supply. whereas CLS is implemented only when the inadequacy of the power supply is encountered. The disadvantages of the PLS approach are twofold. First. the clipped energy cannot be totally recovered when it is more than the unused capacity of the off-peak period. The unused capacity is the maximum amount of extra load that can be filled before exceeding the operator-defined level. Second. the PLS approach performs load curtailment without discrimination. This means that load clipping is performed as long as the load is above the operator-defined level even if the power supply is adequate. The CLS program has none of these disadvantages because it is implemented only when there is power supply inadequacy. during which the amount of load clipping is mostly much smaller than the unused capacity of the off-peak period. The performance of the CLS was compared with the PLS by considering chronological load model. duty cycle and the probability of start-up failure for peaking and cycling generators. planned maintenance of the …,True,g5GJtHMAAAAJ:dfsIfKJdRG4C,26,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/11/8/2155,16210705631958610261,/scholar?cites=16210705631958610261,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/11/8/2155/pdf,0,0,0

In general. the average torque falls rapidly as the rotor speed increases above the base speed. hence the motor will frequently be found to have insufficient torque at higher speed. One way to counter this problem is by using third harmonic back-EMF detection technique during high speed operation because the third harmonic is usually kept a constant relationship with rotor position for any motor speeds and load conditions. Therefore. we could potentially avoid the torque deterioration which commonly occurs in traditional sensorless technique due to the delay of the phase angle between current and back-EMF. Furthermore this method is practically free of noise which may be introduced from inverter switches.

The use of voltage double circuits extends the operating range of converter by mitigating the effects of transformer's parasitic capacitors. The converter has two modes of operation: simultaneous and independent.

We remove open‐end points of the channel connectivity network iteratively to generate a traveltime sequence of networks (Sn). The convex hulls of these traveltime networks provide an interesting topological quantity. which has not been noted thus far. We compute lengths of shrinking traveltime networks L(Sn) and areas of corresponding convex hulls C(Sn). the ratios of which provide convexity measures CM(Sn) of traveltime networks. A statistically significant scaling relationship is found for a model network in the form L(Sn) ∼ A[C(Sn)]0.57. From the plots of the lengths of these traveltime networks and the areas of their corresponding convex hulls as functions of convexity measures. new power law relations are derived.

However. there are many other landslide causative factors which are related to landslide event in Malaysia. One of them is topographical factor which plays an important role in the landslide susceptibility analysis. This paper presents landslide hazard mapping using dominant factors with Poisson Distribution approach and the study area is Penang Island of Malaysia. Landslide hazard map of Penang Island is generated by taking into account of twenty-two landslide causative factors. including fourteen topographic factors. After considering all twenty-two factors for landslide hazard mapping. the analysis is repeated with removing one factor at one time to determine the dominant landslide-causative factors. Eleven dominant factors are selected from the twenty-two factors. Landslide hazard map was segregated into four categories of risks. ie Highly hazardous area. Hazardous area. Moderately hazardous area and Not hazardous area. The maps was assessed using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) based on the area under the curve method (AUC). Landslide hazard map produced by including all 22 factors has an accuracy of 77.75%.

One of the main factors which trigger landslide occurrence is rainfall precipitation. The impact of rainfall precipitation with higher intensities causes the slope stability to decrease due to the infiltration process in inducing landslide. Consequently. the prediction of rainfall precipitation that can trigger landslide occurrence was carried out based on rainfall threshold. In this paper. landslide events and rainfall precipitation have been analysed using daily rainfall data from Kuala Kenderong and Kg. Jeli along the Gerik-Jeli Highway. The rainfall induced landslide was investigated by applying the cumulative rainfall method which comprises the reconstruction of absolute antecedent rainfall for 20 landslide events. Computations of return period for rainfall amount duration and intensity using Gumbel Distribution was carried out to determine the rainfall duration that influenced landslide events. However. available rainfall data and landslide event for this study area cannot be modeled by typical exponential relationship between cumulative rainfall (E) and rainfall duration (D).

To achieve this requirement sufficient energy to propel and operate the device must be taken into consideration. However. the AUV power mainly supply by on board battery (Neocleous. and Schizas. 1999). Thus. the range of operation only depends on how much power it has. There are two options in order to improve the operation time. the first is developing very efficient battery and the second is optimized the AUV system either electrically or mechanically. For the first option. it takes time in order to develop very efficient battery. Then for time being. the second option is always selected by the researcher in order to improve the operation range of the AUV. Takinaci and Atlar.(2002) improved the energy power management in order to optimized the power consumption.

Beside that Husaini. et al.(2009) work on AUV hull design by using numerical method to reduce the drag.As mentioned by Takekoshi. et al..(2005) AUV speed was affected by resistance force along the body. This resistance was due to drag force. Stanway and Stefanov-Wagner (2006) reported that the thrust produced by the propeller was quadraticly by increasing in propeller speed. This phenomenon can be understood by reviewing lifting line theory in Carlton.(2007).

Cham,The gradual phasing-out of asbestos in motorcycles brake friction materials in many parts of the world has sparked the onset of extensive research and development into safer alternatives. As a result. the brake friction industry has seen the birth of different brake pads and shoes in the past decade. each with their own unique composition. yet performing the very same task and claiming to be better than others. This suggests that the selection of the brake pad design geometry surface is based more on original shape and simulation trial and error rather than fundamental understanding. This analysis strives to eliminate the cloud of uncertainty by providing an insight into the pros and cons of the geometry surface shape of motorcycle brake pad and make-up used in contemporary temperature behavior distribution on pads and shoes.

II and III),2019,Surya Hardi and R Harahap and S Ahmad and M Isa,2088,Int J Pow Elec & Dri Syst ISSN,8694,8694,,Variable speed drives (VSDs) are widely used in various applications mainly in process industry need constant rotational speed. It is developed from power electronic components thus saving energy in its operation. Unfortunately. it is susceptible against power quality problem for example voltage sags. The VSD may be disruption or drop out when it is supplied by voltage sags and it is determined by sag characteristics. This study is to investigate effect of voltage sags Types I. II and III on VSD through laboratory testing. The voltage sags characteristics are generated from voltage sag generator (Shaffner 2100 EMC). The effects are presented in susceptibility curves in disruption and drop out conditions. The curves resulted are evaluated by standard curve recommended. Test results show that voltage sag Type I cause the VSD disruption only. whereas two types sag other result in the VSD disruption and also drop out. Evaluation results explain a few test points are in operation area for disruption condition whereas test points for dropping out far below the threshold recommended. Hence the VSD has good quality to voltage sags.,True,r7eHgXQAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Surya_Hardi2/publication/333538532_Ride_through_testing_of_variable_speed_drive_due_to_voltage_sag_types_types_I_II_and_III/links/5d46b9f0a6fdcc370a7a059d/Ride-through-testing-of-variable-speed-drive-due-to-voltage-sag-types-types-I-II-and-III.pdf,9338195520621400459,/scholar?cites=9338195520621400459,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Surya_Hardi2/publication/333538532_Ride_through_testing_of_variable_speed_drive_due_to_voltage_sag_types_types_I_II_and_III/links/5d46b9f0a6fdcc370a7a059d/Ride-through-testing-of-variable-speed-drive-due-to-voltage-sag-types-types-I-II-and-III.pdf,0,0,0

B. C and D on induction motor based on experimental test. The effect can be investigated in term the current peaks and speed variation. The magnitudes depend on magnitude of sag and duration. voltage sag types. during and recovery voltage sag. Several of voltage sag characteristics have been conducted in different magnitude. duration and sag types. The results show that the current peaks generated reach more than 4 times of normal current and it was achieved at recovery voltage instant. Sag magnitude has great influence on the current peak but sag duration is not significantly. Type A voltage sag only can cause the motor stop running and it was achieved when it was subjected to sag magnitude of 10% and 6s in duration. The motor stops running in shorter duration when it was subjected to interruption with sag duration of 4s.
