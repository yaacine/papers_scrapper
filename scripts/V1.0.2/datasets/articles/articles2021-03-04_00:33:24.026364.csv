1190507,Heavy metals in marine mammals,2003,Krishna Das and Virginie Debacker and Stéphane Pillet and Jean-Marie Bouquegneau,3,Toxicology of marine mammals,,135-167,Taylor & Francis London,During the past few decades. increasing concern about environmental pollution has led to many investigations on heavy metals and their distribution in the sea. air or biological materials. The distribution of xenobiotics in the marine environment is not homogeneous and a considerable variation of the concentrations may occur regionally and temporally. The use of bioindicators offers a useful alternative for pollution monitoring studies. Marine mammals appear to be potentially valuable indicators of the level of heavy metals accumulated in the marine environment: according to their top position in the trophic network. their long life span and their long biological half-time of elimination of pollutants. these animals accumulate high levels of chemicals such as organochlorines (Kamrin and Ringer. 1994; Tanabe et al.. 1994). or heavy metals (Bouquegneau and Joiris. 1988. 1992; André et al.. 1991a; Dietz et al.. 1998). The increased interest in studying contaminants in marine mammals is due to large-scale die-off (Sarokin and Schulkin. 1992; Forcada et al.. 1994) or impaired reproduction (De Guise et al.. 1995). which could lead to population declines of some pinniped and small cetacean species in Europe and North America. and the ﬁnding of relatively large contaminant burdens in these animals. In many cases. morbillivirus infections were the primary cause of the disease outbreaks (Heide-Jørgensen et al.. 1992; Thompson and Hall. 1993; de Swart et al.. 1995a). These mass mortalities among seals and dolphins inhabiting contaminated marine areas have led to speculation about the possible involvement of immunosuppression associated with …,True,q1FtjusAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,325,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ToMuyu-t_oYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA135&dq=info:8HlqYQlEPrEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Ax_g7l2VMs&sig=Vp_aJoDk8rndMs5QymgcgiP-6aA,12771720400349067760,/scholar?cites=12771720400349067760,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/3680/1/2003%20Heavy%20metals%20in%20marine%20mammals.pdf,0,0,0
1190508,Detection of anthropogenic particles in fish stomachs: an isolation method adapted to identification by Raman spectroscopy,2015,France Collard and Bernard Gilbert and Gauthier Eppe and Eric Parmentier and Krishna Das,69,Archives of environmental contamination and toxicology,3,331-339,Springer US,Microplastic particles (MP) contaminate oceans and affect marine organisms in several ways. Ingestion combined with food intake is generally reported. However. data interpretation often is circumvented by the difficulty to separate MP from bulk samples. Visual examination often is used as one or the only step to sort these particles. However. color. size. and shape are insufficient and often unreliable criteria. We present an extraction method based on hypochlorite digestion and isolation of MP from the membrane by sonication. The protocol is especially well adapted to a subsequent analysis by Raman spectroscopy. The method avoids fluorescence problems. allowing better identification of anthropogenic particles (AP) from stomach contents of fish by Raman spectroscopy.

Our results were compared to previously described stomach contents and isotopic composition of potential preys. Isotopic ratio δ15N suggested that tope sharks fed at a higher trophic level (16.7‰ in the muscle) than the other species. reflecting its piscivorous diet. The lower values of spiny dogfish (11.6‰ in the muscle) might be explained. amongst other things. by either its migratory behaviour or its preference for preys from lower trophic levels.

1190517,Metallothioneins in marine mammals,2000,Krishna Das and Virginie Debacker and Jean-Marie Bouquegneau,46,,2,,,[en] Metallothioneins (MTs) have been detected in livers and kidneys of 10 marine mammals species (Pinnipeds and Odontocetes). Characterization of renal MTs of striped dolphin has shown that the protein has two isoforms (MT-1 and MT-2) with a molecular weight estimated around 6.800. MT concentrations also vary widely in marine mammals tissues (from 58 to 1.200 microg xg (-1) ww) underlying the numerous parameters involved: physiological status. pregnancy. age. diet. The participation of this protein in metal detoxification has been investigated since high levels of cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) have been measured in livers and kidneys of marine mammals. It has been suggested that those animals can mitigate at least in part. the toxic effects of Cd and Hg through binding to MTs. The percentage of the cytosolic Cd bound to MTs can reach almost 100%. On the contrary. the percentage of hepatic and renal Hg bound to MT is very low (generally less than 10%) and this metal is mainly associated with selenium (HgSe) under a detoxified form in the insoluble fraction of the tissues. MTs appear to play a minor role in the binding and detoxification of Hg by marine mammals. On the contrary. close and dynamic interactions occur between Cd and MTs. Cytosolic MTs appear as a potential short term way of detoxification of Cd accumulated from diet. Long-term detoxification would imply a sequestration of the metal under a precipitated form (eg in lysosomes).,True,q1FtjusAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,115,https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/191,2402164741526052625,/scholar?cites=2402164741526052625,,https://orbi.uliege.be/jspui/bitstream/2268/191/1/2000%20cellular%20%26%20molecular%20biology.pdf,0,0,0

1190526,Isotope analysis reveals foraging area dichotomy for Atlantic leatherback turtles,2008,Stéphane Caut and Elodie Guirlet and Elena Angulo and Krishna Das and Marc Girondot,3,PLoS One,3,e1845,Public Library of Science,BackgroundThe leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) has undergone a dramatic decline over the last 25 years. and this is believed to be primarily the result of mortality associated with fisheries bycatch followed by egg and nesting female harvest. Atlantic leatherback turtles undertake long migrations across ocean basins from subtropical and tropical nesting beaches to productive frontal areas. Migration between two nesting seasons can last 2 or 3 years. a time period termed the remigration interval (RI). Recent satellite transmitter data revealed that Atlantic leatherbacks follow two major dispersion patterns after nesting season. through the North Gulf Stream area or more eastward across the North Equatorial Current. However. information on the whole RI is lacking. precluding the accurate identification of feeding areas where conservation measures may need to be applied.Methodology/Principal FindingsUsing stable isotopes as dietary tracers we determined the characteristics of feeding grounds of leatherback females nesting in French Guiana. During migration. 3-year RI females differed from 2-year RI females in their isotope values. implying differences in their choice of feeding habitats (offshore vs. more coastal) and foraging latitude (North Atlantic vs. West African coasts. respectively). Egg-yolk and blood isotope values are correlated in nesting females. indicating that egg analysis is a useful tool for assessing isotope values in these turtles. including adults when not available.Conclusions/SignificanceOur results complement previous data on turtle movements during the first year following the nesting season. integrating the diet …,True,q1FtjusAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,86,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001845,14067462372636652433,/scholar?cites=14067462372636652433,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001845,0,0,0

In particular. the immune system is known to be susceptible to long-term mercury exposure. The aims of the present study were (1) to determine the mercury level in the blood of free-ranging harbour seals from the North Sea and (2) to examine the link between methylmercury in vitro exposure and immune functions using seal and human mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (T-lymphocytes). Total mercury was analysed in the blood of 22 harbour seals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from seals (n = 11) and from humans (n = 9). Stimulated lymphocytes of both species were exposed to functional tests (proliferation. metabolic activity. radioactive precursor incorporation) under increasing doses of methylmercury (0.1 to 10 μM). The expression of cytokines (IL-2. IL-4 and TGF-β) was investigated in seal lymphocytes by RT-PCR and by real time quantitative PCR (n = 5) at methylmercury concentrations of 0.2 and 1 μM. Finally. proteomics analysis was attempted on human lymphocytes (cytoplasmic fraction) in order to identify biochemical pathways of toxicity at concentration of 1 μM (n = 3). The results showed that the number of seal lymphocytes. viability. metabolic activity.

Antarctica,2004,CC Martins and MC Bícego and S Taniguchi and RC Montone,16,Antarctic Science,2,117-122,,Aliphatic (AHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concentrations were measured in marine surface sediments around the Brazilian station in Admiralty Bay. during the summers of 1997/98 and 1999/2000 using GC-FID and GC-MS. Total aliphatic hydrocarbons ranged from 0.15 to 13.28 µg. g-1 (dry weight) while n-alkanes varied between 0.10 and 9.63 µg. g-1. The highest concentrations were obtained at the sewage outfall. with decreasing levels away from the outfall. The distribution of n-alkanes showed significant quantities of long chain n-alkanes (n-C22 to n-C34) at sites near the Brazilian station that may be attributed to the station activities. A short chain n-alkanes sequence (n-C12 to n-C21) associated with diesel fuel arctic (DFA) was present in all the samples. Total PAHs varied from 9.45 to 270.5 ng. g-1. The higher PAHs level and the presence of an unresolved complex mixture only in sediment from the sewage outfall is an indication of oil contamination at this location. A slight increase in PAHs near the Brazilian station since 1993 may be attributed to an increase in the number of staff over recent years.

Urbanised littoral areas receive the impact of effluent discharges resulting. in general. in the contamination of water. sediments and biota that can affect human health by direct contact or through the food chain. Almost all marine coastal ecosystems have complex structural and dynamic characteristics that can be easily modified by human influence. The north coast of the Sao Paulo State (Brazil). the most populated state of the country. has several enclosed bays strongly affected by increasing tourism and urbanisation. Ubatuba Bay is located in the northern coast of Sao Paulo State (Fig. 1). and is protected from south and southwest waves from the open sea. Water circulation is clock-wise with the inflow from the south. The input of fluvial sediments is strongly dependent on the rainfall regime leading to a higher contribution during the summer season (Mahiques et al.. 1998). Four rivers flow into the bay and greatly influence its water quality (CETESB. 2000; Burone et al.. 2003) especially. during summer and rainy periods when large amounts of untreated sewage are introduced from Ubatuba City. due to the rapid increase in the city’s population (five times greater).There are no previous studies concerning the accumulation of contaminants in bottom sediments of this bay; however previous investigations showed alterations of benthic macrofauna (Santos and Pires-Vanin. 2004) and benthic foraminifera communities (Burone and Pires-Vanin. 2006).

Injection of larger than usual sample volumes increases sensitivity and/or reduces (or even eliminates) the need for extract concentration steps. Also. an LVI technique can serve as an interface for on-line connection of GC with a sample preparation step or with liquid chromatography. This article reviews the currently available LVI techniques. including basic approaches to their optimization and important real-world applications. The most common LVI methods are on-column and programmed temperature vaporization (PTV) in solvent split mode.

A total of 98 documents covering reports from 1982 to 2010 were included. and of these 95% had their full contents accessed. Seventy documents were obtained online as scientific abstracts from the Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The occurrence of marine debris in the Antarctic environment. fur seal entanglement in marine debris. interactions between seabirds and marine debris and long range transport of benthos on floating plastics were the main issues identified. Fishing operations in the Southern Ocean were identified as the major source of marine debris. but depending on the type of debris reported. plastics from lower latitudes may also cross the Polar Front (PF). Possible links between Antarctic and South America. the closest intercontinental connection. in relation to plastic marine debris pollution are highlighted. As reported at lower latitudes. plastic pollution is an important problem now challenging the Antarctic environment.

The Antarctic and Southern Ocean community. represented by 75 scientists and policy-makers from 22 countries. recently met to formulate a collective vision on the priorities for Antarctic research for the next two decades and beyond. Here. we assess high-interest research areas related specifically to Southern Ocean life and ecology that. although not all retained as the 80 top priorities among the addressed scientific domains. are of considerable relevance to the biology and ecology of the Southern Ocean. As certain regions of the Southern Ocean ecosystems have witnessed abiotic and biotic changes in the last decades (e.g. warming. changes in sea ice and abundance of marine organisms). such an exercise was urgently needed. We concluded that basic biological information on the taxonomy of numerous organisms is still lacking in areas such as the deep-ocean floor or the under-ice environments. Furthermore. there is a need for knowledge about the response and resilience of Antarctic marine ecosystems to change. The continuation of a long-term commitment and the development and use of innovative technology to adequately monitor the Southern Ocean ecosystems is required.

Antarctic Peninsula,2009,Joaquim O Branco and Erli S Costa and Jansen de Araujo and Edison Durigon and Maria Alice S Alves,26,Zoologia (Curitiba),3,562-566,Sociedade Brasileira de Zoologia,We examined the distribution. abundance and density of the Kelp Gull. Larus dominicanus (Lichtenstein. 1823). at Keller Peninsula on two occasions during the breeding season of 2007-2008 (once for incubation and once for chick stages) and compared our results with previously published data. We present information on the number of eggs. incubation success. and initial development of L. dominicanus chicks in the studied sites. The abundance and density of the species has remained statistically similar in Keller Peninsula over the last 30 years (since 1978-1979). Although the abundance and density were almost unchanged. we recorded alterations in the occupation of the breeding areas by L. dominicanus. mainly the abandonment of breeding sites in the eastern portion of Keller Peninsula. The results of the present study compared with similar previous investigations on the abundance of L. dominicanus indicate that the populations have been in equilibrium over the years.,True,Q6Ow2q8AAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,6,https://www.scielo.br/pdf/zool/v26n3/aop0509.pdf,3478125523011607041,/scholar?cites=3478125523011607041,,https://www.scielo.br/pdf/zool/v26n3/aop0509.pdf,0,0,0

Together with matching races of its co-mimic Heliconius melpomene. H. erato also represents a textbook case of Müllerian mimicry. a phenomenon where common warning signals are shared amongst noxious organisms. It is of great interest to identify the specific genes that control the mimetic wing patterns of H. erato and H. melpomene. To this end we have undertaken comparative mapping and targeted genomic sequencing in both species. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of genomic sequences linked to color pattern mimicry genes in Heliconius. Scoring AFLP polymorphisms in H. erato broods allowed us to survey loci at approximately 362 kb intervals across the genome. With this strategy we were able to identify markers tightly linked to two color pattern genes: D and Cr. which were then used to screen H. erato BAC libraries in order to identify clones for sequencing. Gene density across 600 kb of BAC sequences appeared relatively low. although the number of predicted open reading frames was typical for an insect. We focused analyses on the D- and Cr-linked H. erato BAC sequences and on the Yb-linked H. melpomene BAC sequence. A comparative analysis between homologous regions of H. erato (Cr-linked BAC) and H. melpomene (Yb-linked BAC) revealed high levels of sequence conservation and microsynteny between the two species. We found that repeated elements constitute 26% and 20% of BAC sequences from H. erato and H. melpomene …,True,9lRkMOIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,56,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-9-345,14231482514609040180,/scholar?cites=14231482514609040180,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-9-345,0,0,0

Although this work demonstrates a number of cases where homologous loci underlie both convergent and divergent wing pattern change among different Heliconius species. it is still unclear exactly how many loci underlie pattern variation across the genus. To address this question for Heliconius erato. we created fifteen independent crosses utilizing the four most distinct color pattern races and analyzed color pattern segregation across a total of 1271 F2 and backcross offspring. Additionally. we used the most variable brood. an F2 cross between H. himera and the east Ecuadorian H. erato notabilis. to perform a quantitative genetic analysis of color pattern variation and produce a detailed map of the loci likely involved in the H. erato color pattern radiation. Using AFLP and gene based markers. we show that fewer major genes than previously envisioned control the color pattern variation in H. erato. We describe for the first time the genetic architecture of H. erato wing color pattern by assessing quantitative variation in addition to traditional linkage mapping. In particular. our data suggest three genomic intervals modulate the bulk of the observed variation in color. Furthermore. we also identify several modifier loci of moderate effect size that contribute to the quantitative wing pattern variation.

In order to understand the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to Heliconius melpomene. we queried the H. melpomene draft sequence to identify repetitive sequences. We determined that TEs comprise ~25% of the genome. The predominant class of TEs (~12% of the genome) was the non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons. including a novel SINE family. However. this was only slightly higher than content derived from DNA transposons. which are diverse. with several families having mobilized in the recent past. Compared to the only other well-studied lepidopteran genome. Bombyx mori. H. melpomene exhibits a higher DNA transposon content and a distinct repertoire of retrotransposons. We also found that H. melpomene exhibits a high rate of TE turnover with few older elements accumulating in the genome. Our analysis represents the first complete. de novo characterization of TE content in a butterfly genome and suggests that. while TEs are able to invade and multiply.

Jiggins and Naisbit RE and Coe RL and J Mallet,411,Nature,,302-305,,Speciation is facilitated if ecological adaptation directly causes assortative mating 1. but few natural examples are known. Here we show that a shift in colour pattern mimicry was crucial in the origin of two butterfly species. The sister species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno recently diverged to mimic different model taxa. and our experiments show that their mimetic coloration is also important in choosing mates. Assortative mating between the sister species means that hybridization is rare in nature. and the few hybrids that are produced are non-mimetic. poorly adapted intermediates. Thus. the mimetic shift has caused both pre-mating and post-mating isolation. In addition. individuals from a population of H. melpomene allopatric to H. cydno court and mate with H. cydno more readily than those from a sympatric population.

Recent studies show bimodality to be associated strongly with assortative mating or fertilization. and only weakly with overall levels of genetic divergence or intrinsic genomic incompatibility.

One method tests for a genome-wide excess of shared derived alleles between taxa using Patterson’s D statistic. but does not establish which loci show such an excess or whether the excess is due to introgression or ancestral population structure. Several recent studies have extended the use of D by applying the statistic to small genomic regions. rather than genome-wide.

Here we contrast three butterfly species. all classic examples of Müllerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a locus. Yb. which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene. maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr. which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore. the same genomic location acts as a “supergene”. determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species. H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance. whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato. but they are not involved in mimetic polymorphism in H. numata. Hence. a single region from the multilocus colour pattern architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata. presumably as a result of selection for mimetic “supergene” polymorphism without intermediates.

Here. we have examined the role of introgressive hybridisation in transferring adaptations between mimetic Heliconius butterflies. taking advantage of the recent identification of a gene regulating red wing patterns in this genus. By sequencing regions both linked and unlinked to the red colour locus. we found a region that displays an almost perfect genotype by phenotype association across four species. H. melpomene. H. cydno. H. timareta. and H. heurippa. This particular segment is located 70 kb downstream of the red colour specification gene optix. and coalescent analysis indicates repeated introgression of adaptive alleles from H. melpomene into the H. cydno species clade.

Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence. and they have played an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and constraints in adaptive evolution. Here we contrast three butterfly species. all classic examples of Müllerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a locus. Yb. which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene. maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr. which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore. the same genomic location acts as a “supergene”. determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species. H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance. whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato. but they are not involved in mimetic polymorphism in H. numata. Hence. a single region from the multilocus colour pattern architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata. presumably as a result of selection for mimetic “supergene” polymorphism without intermediates.

Rapid evolution in this region was accompanied by strong transition/transversion bias and large variation in the probability of a DNA substitution among sites.

This divergence ``ceiling'' was reached rapidly and led to a decay in the relative rate of control-region/cytb b evolution.

The genes controlling pattern variation are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect. where allelic variation causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium (LD). and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern. we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old. However. across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. Interestingly. coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated. suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites. conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as “supergenes.” Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic.

They are also habitats for microorganisms. yet these microbial symbionts are little-studied. despite their likely importance to butterfly ecology and evolution. In particular. the diversity and composition of the microbial communities inhabiting adult butterflies remain uncharacterized. and it is unknown how the larval (caterpillar) and adult microbiota compare. To address these knowledge gaps. we used Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from internal bacterial communities associated with multiple life stages of the neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato. We found that the leaf-chewing larvae and nectar- and pollen-feeding adults of H. erato contain markedly distinct bacterial communities. a pattern presumably rooted in their distinct diets. Larvae and adult butterflies host relatively small and similar numbers of bacterial phylotypes. but few are common to both stages. The larval microbiota clearly simplifies and reorganizes during metamorphosis; thus. structural changes in a butterfly's bacterial community parallel those in its own morphology. We furthermore identify specific bacterial taxa that may mediate larval and adult feeding biology in Heliconius and other butterflies. Although male and female Heliconius adults differ in reproductive physiology and degree of pollen feeding. bacterial communities associated with H. erato are not sexually dimorphic.

These insect-plant interactions are mediated by insect gustatory receptors (Grs) and olfactory receptors (Ors). An analysis of the reference genome of the butterfly Heliconius melpomene. which feeds on passion-flower vines (Passiflora spp.). together with whole-genome sequencing within the species and across the Heliconius phylogeny has permitted an unprecedented opportunity to study the patterns of gene duplication and copy-number variation (CNV) among these key sensory genes. We report in silico gene predictions of 73 Gr genes in the H. melpomene reference genome. including putative CO2. sugar. sugar alcohol. fructose. and bitter receptors. The majority of these Grs are the result of gene duplications since Heliconius shared a common ancestor with the monarch butterfly or the silkmoth. Among Grs but not Ors. CNVs are more common within species in those gene lineages that have also duplicated over this evolutionary time-scale. suggesting ongoing rapid gene family evolution. Deep sequencing (∼1 billion reads) of transcriptomes from proboscis and labial palps. antennae. and legs of adult H. melpomene males and females indicates that 67 of the predicted 73 Gr genes and 67 of the 70 predicted Or genes are expressed in these three tissues.

We investigated the origins of a complex wing pattern found among Amazonian Heliconius butterflies. Genome sequence data from 142 individuals across 17 species identified narrow regions associated with two distinct red colour pattern elements. dennis and ray. We hypothesise that these modules in non-coding sequence represent distinct cis-regulatory loci that control expression of the transcription factor optix. which in turn controls red pattern variation across Heliconius. Phylogenetic analysis of the two elements demonstrated that they have distinct evolutionary histories and that novel adaptive morphological variation was created by shuffling these cis-regulatory modules through recombination between divergent lineages. In addition. recombination of modules into different combinations within species further contributes to diversity. Analysis of the timing of diversification in these two regions supports the hypothesis of introgression moving regulatory modules between species. rather than shared ancestral variation. The dennis phenotype introgressed into Heliconius melpomene at about the same time that ray originated in this group. while ray introgressed back into H. elevatus much more recently. We show that shuffling of existing enhancer elements both within and between species provides a mechanism for rapid diversification and generation of novel morphological combinations during adaptive radiation.,True,LX0ybbMAAAAJ:O0nohqN1r9EC,107,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002353,403446930635101467,/scholar?cites=403446930635101467,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002353,0,0,0

Introgression can also erode species differences over time. but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain postmating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate. which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here. we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene (mel). H. cydno (cyd). and H. timareta (tim). using whole genomes of 92 individuals. and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions. we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic. with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition. long chromosomes. which have lower recombination rates. produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes.

1190830,Exploring evolutionary relationships across the genome using topology weighting,2017,Simon H Martin and Steven M Van Belleghem,206,Genetics,1,429-438,Oxford University Press,We introduce the concept of topology weighting. a method for quantifying relationships between taxa that are not necessarily monophyletic. and visualizing how these relationships change across the genome. A given set of taxa can be related in a limited number of ways. but if each taxon is represented by multiple sequences. the number of possible topologies becomes very large. Topology weighting reduces this complexity by quantifying the contribution of each taxon topology to the full tree. We describe our method for topology weighting by iterative sampling of subtrees (Twisst). and test it on both simulated and real genomic data.

Such ecological mating cues are now considered more common than previously thought. but we still know little about the genetic changes underlying their evolution or more generally about the genetic basis for assortative mating behaviors. Both tight physical linkage and the existence of large-effect preference loci will strengthen genetic associations between behavioral and ecological barriers. promoting the evolution of assortative mating. The warning patterns of Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno are under disruptive selection due to increased predation of nonmimetic hybrids and are used during mate recognition. We carried out a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of preference behaviors between these species and showed that divergent male preference has a simple genetic basis. We identify three QTLs that together explain a large proportion (approximately 60%) of the difference in preference behavior observed between the parental species. One of these QTLs is just 1.2 (0–4.8) centiMorgans (cM) from the major color pattern gene optix. and. individually. all three have a large effect on the preference phenotype. Genomic divergence between H. cydno and H. melpomene is high but broadly heterogenous. and admixture is reduced at the preference–optix color pattern locus but not the other preference QTLs.

This possibility has not been adequately explored in the Ascomycota. the most species-rich fungal phylum.

Here we conduct a population genomic study to test the hypothesis that adaptation to WGD has been mediated by adaptive gene flow between A. arenosa and A. lyrata.

Due to their economic importance. whole-genome sequence information has rapidly become available for species including Fusarium circinatum. Fusarium fujikuroi and Fusarium verticillioides. each of which represent one of the three main clades known in this complex. However. no previous studies have explored the genomic commonalities and differences among these fungi. In this study. a previously completed genetic linkage map for an interspecific cross between Fusarium temperatum and F. circinatum. together with genomic sequence data. was utilized to consider the level of synteny between the three Fusarium genomes. Regions that are homologous amongst the Fusarium genomes examined were identified using in silico and pyrosequenced amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragment analyses. Homology was determined using BLAST analysis of the sequences. with 777 homologous regions aligned to F. fujikuroi and F. verticillioides. This also made it possible to assign the linkage groups from the interspecific cross to their corresponding chromosomes in F. verticillioides and F. fujikuroi. as well as to assign two previously unmapped supercontigs of F. verticillioides to probable chromosomal locations.

We investigated the origins of a complex wing pattern found among Amazonian Heliconius butterflies. Genome sequence data from 142 individuals across 17 species identified narrow regions associated with two distinct red colour pattern elements. dennis and ray. We hypothesise that these modules in non-coding sequence represent distinct cis-regulatory loci that control expression of the transcription factor optix. which in turn controls red pattern variation across Heliconius. Phylogenetic analysis of the two elements demonstrated that they have distinct evolutionary histories and that novel adaptive morphological variation was created by shuffling these cis-regulatory modules through recombination between divergent lineages. In addition. recombination of modules into different combinations within species further contributes to diversity. Analysis of the timing of diversification in these two regions supports the hypothesis of introgression moving regulatory modules between species. rather than shared ancestral variation. The dennis phenotype introgressed into Heliconius melpomene at about the same time that ray originated in this group. while ray introgressed back into H. elevatus much more recently.

So far. there has been a lack of direct molecular evidence for hybridization generating novel traits directly involved in animal speciation. Heliconius butterflies exhibit bright aposematic color patterns that also act as cues in assortative mating. Heliconius heurippa has been proposed as a hybrid species. and its color pattern can be recreated by introgression of the H. m. melpomene red band into the genetic background of the yellow banded H. cydno cordula. This hybrid color pattern is also involved in mate choice and leads to reproductive isolation between H. heurippa and its close relatives. Here. we provide molecular evidence for adaptive introgression by sequencing genes across the Heliconius red band locus and comparing them to unlinked wing patterning genes in H. melpomene.

In contrast. among 344 SNPs distributed among 13 genes in the red band region (18.629bp). most showed H. heurippa related with H. c. cordula. but a block of around 6.5kb located in the 3′ of a putative kinesin gene grouped H. heurippa with H. m. melpomene. supporting the hybrid introgression hypothesis. Genealogical reconstruction showed that this introgression occurred after divergence of the parental species. perhaps around 0.43Mya.

Introgression can also erode species differences over time. but selection against introgression at certain loci acts to maintain postmating species barriers. Theory predicts that species barriers made up of many loci throughout the genome should lead to a broad correlation between introgression and recombination rate. which determines the extent to which selection on deleterious foreign alleles will affect neutral alleles at physically linked loci. Here. we describe the variation in genealogical relationships across the genome among three species of Heliconius butterflies: H. melpomene (mel). H. cydno (cyd). and H. timareta (tim). using whole genomes of 92 individuals. and ask whether this variation can be explained by heterogeneous barriers to introgression. We find that species relationships vary predictably at the chromosomal scale. By quantifying recombination rate and admixture proportions. we then show that rates of introgression are predicted by variation in recombination rate. This implies that species barriers are highly polygenic. with selection acting against introgressed alleles across most of the genome. In addition. long chromosomes. which have lower recombination rates. produce stronger barriers on average than short chromosomes. Finally. we find a consistent difference between two species pairs on either side of the Andes. which suggests differences in the architecture of the species barriers.

Heliconius butterflies exhibit bright aposematic color patterns that also act as cues in assortative mating. Heliconius heurippa has a color pattern that can be recreated by introgression of the H. melpomene red band into an H. cydno genetic background. Wild H. heurippa males show assortative mating based on color pattern and we here investigate the origin of this preference by studying first‐generation backcross hybrids between H. melpomene and H. cydno that resemble H. heurippa.

Despite the economic. industrial and biological importance of Xanthomonas. the classification and phylogenetic relationships within the genus are still under active debate. Some of the relationships between pathovars and species have not been thoroughly clarified. with old pathovars becoming new species. A change in the genus name has been recently suggested for Xanthomonas albilineans. an early branching species currently located in this genus. but a thorough phylogenomic reconstruction would aid in solving these and other discrepancies in this genus. Here we report the results of the genome-wide analysis of DNA sequences from 989 orthologous groups from 17 Xanthomonas spp. genomes available to date. representing all major lineages within the genus. The phylogenetic and computational analyses used in this study have been automated in a Perl package designated Unus. which provides a framework for phylogenomic analyses which can be applied to other datasets at the genomic level. Unus can also be easily incorporated into other phylogenomic pipelines. Our phylogeny agrees with previous phylogenetic topologies on the genus. but revealed that the genomes of Xanthomonas citri and Xanthomonas fuscans belong to the same species. and that of Xanthomonas albilineans is basal to the joint clade of Xanthomonas and Xylella fastidiosa.

Extensive ecological. behavioural and genetic studies of Heliconius butterflies have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of speciation. Male pheromones. although long suspected to play an important role. have received relatively little attention in this genus. Here. we combine morphological. chemical and behavioural analyses of male pheromones in the Neotropical butterfly Heliconius melpomene. First. we identify putative androconia that are specialized brush-like scales that lie within the shiny grey region of the male hindwing. We then describe putative male sex pheromone compounds. which are largely confined to the androconial region of the hindwing of mature males. but are absent in immature males and females. Finally. behavioural choice experiments reveal that females of H. melpomene. H. erato and H. timareta strongly discriminate against conspecific males which have their androconial region experimentally blocked. As well as demonstrating the importance of chemical signalling for female mate choice in Heliconius butterflies. the results describe structures involved in release of the pheromone and a list of potential male sex pheromone compounds.,True,gmC3kTQAAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,42,https://peerj.com/articles/3953/,2556206925675990379,/scholar?cites=2556206925675990379,,https://peerj.com/articles/3953/,0,0,0

Such ecological mating cues are now considered more common than previously thought. but we still know little about the genetic changes underlying their evolution or more generally about the genetic basis for assortative mating behaviors. Both tight physical linkage and the existence of large-effect preference loci will strengthen genetic associations between behavioral and ecological barriers. promoting the evolution of assortative mating. The warning patterns of Heliconius melpomene and H. cydno are under disruptive selection due to increased predation of nonmimetic hybrids and are used during mate recognition. We carried out a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of preference behaviors between these species and showed that divergent male preference has a simple genetic basis. We identify three QTLs that together explain a large proportion (approximately 60%) of the difference in preference behavior observed between the parental species. One of these QTLs is just 1.2 (0–4.8) centiMorgans (cM) from the major color pattern gene optix. and. individually. all three have a large effect on the preference phenotype. Genomic divergence between H. cydno and H. melpomene is high but broadly heterogenous. and admixture is reduced at the preference–optix color pattern locus but not the other preference QTLs.

The sympatric butterfly species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno are separated by many strong barriers. but the species still hybridize infrequently in the wild. and around 40% of the genome is influenced by introgression. We tested the hypothesis that genetic barriers between the species are maintained by inversions or other mechanisms that reduce between‐species recombination rate. We constructed fine‐scale recombination maps for Panamanian populations of both species and their hybrids to directly measure recombination rate within and between species. and generated long sequence reads to detect inversions.

There is increasing evidence that such cases of rapid parallel evolution are fueled by standing genetic variation. but the source of this genetic variation remains poorly understood. In the saltmarsh beetle Pogonus chalceus. short-winged ‘tidal’ and long-winged ‘seasonal’ ecotypes have diverged in response to contrasting hydrological regimes and can be repeatedly found along the Atlantic European coast. By analyzing genomic variation across the beetles’ distribution. we reveal that alleles selected in the tidal ecotype are spread across the genome and evolved during a singular and. likely. geographically isolated divergence event. within the last 190 Kya. Due to subsequent admixture. the ancient and differentially selected alleles are currently polymorphic in most populations across its range. which could potentially allow for the fast evolution of one ecotype from a small number of random individuals. as low as 5 to 15. from a population of the other ecotype. Our results suggest that cases of fast parallel ecological divergence can be the result of evolution at two different time frames: divergence in the past. followed by repeated selection on the same divergently evolved alleles after admixture. These findings highlight the importance of an ancient and. likely. allopatric divergence event for driving the rate and direction of contemporary fast evolution under gene flow. This mechanism is potentially driven by periods of geographic isolation imposed by large-scale environmental changes such as glacial cycles.,True,w_PoEw4AAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007796&rev=1,13172591120983655504,/scholar?cites=13172591120983655504,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007796&rev=1,0,0,0

Heidelberg,The within-species genetic variation due to recombinations leads to a mosaic-like structure of DNA. This structure can be modeled. e.g. by parsing sample sequences of current DNA with respect to a small number of founders. The founders represent the ancestral sequence material from which the sample was created in a sequence of recombination steps. This scenario has recently been successfully applied on developing probabilistic Hidden Markov Methods for haplotyping genotypic data. In this paper we introduce a combinatorial method for haplotyping that is based on a similar parsing idea. We formulate a polynomial-time parsing algorithm that finds minimum cross-over parse in a simplified ‘flat’ parsing model that ignores the historical hierarchy of recombinations.

Most species exhibit constrained chromosome evolution with nearly identical haploid chromosome counts and chromosome-level gene collinearity among species more than 140 million years divergent. However. a few species possess radically inflated chromosomal counts due to extensive fission and fusion events. To address this enigma of constraint in the face of an exceptional ability to change. we investigated an unprecedented reorganization of the standard lepidopteran chromosome structure in the green-veined white butterfly (Pieris napi). We find that gene content in P. napi has been extensively rearranged in large collinear blocks. which until now have been masked by a haploid chromosome number close to the lepidopteran average.

Yet obtaining accurate estimates in the wild through direct observation can be challenging or even impossible. particularly over large spatial and temporal scales.

We therefore utilized genomewide marker data to estimate dispersal in the classic metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia L.). in the Åland Islands in SW Finland.

To overcome this. we aimed 1) to develop a linkage map for this species. and 2) to identify markers/variants associated with economically important traits in kingfish (with an emphasis on body weight). Genetic and genomic analyses were conducted using 13.898 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) generated from a new high through-put genotyping by sequencing platform. Diversity Arrays Technology (DArTseq™) in a pedigreed population comprising 752 animals. The linkage analysis enabled to map about 4.000 markers to 24 linkage groups (LG). with an average density of 3.4 SNPs per cM. The linkage map was integrated into a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and identified six variants/SNPs associated with body weight (P< 5e-5) when a multi-locus mixed model was used. Two out of the six significant markers were mapped to linkage groups 17 and 23. and collectively they explained 5.8% of the total genetic variance.

Several lines of ecological research can now be profitably addressed using genomics technology. including issues of nutrient cycling. population structure. life-history variation. trophic interaction. stress responses. and adaptation to environmental change. This new edition addresses a series of fundamental ecological questions: the relationship between community structure and ecological function in ecosystems; how variation in life-history patterns among species can be explained from interaction between the genome and the environment; the molecular responses to changing and toxic environmental conditions; adaptive phenotypes and their relationship to genetic variation. Each of these questions is evaluated in the light of recent advances in genomics research. paying particular attention to data obtained from sequencing and screening of environmental genomes (metagenomics). microarray-based transcription profiling. gene expression directed by signal-transduction pathways. and the analysis of genomic polymorphisms. The chapters covering these key areas are preceded by discussions of genomics methodology (including an overview of next-generation sequencing technologies) and comparative genomics. and the book concludes with a chapter on integrative approaches such as ecological control analysis.

Under strong selective pressure many animals may evolve an enhanced stress tolerance. This can be achieved by altering the structure of proteins (through mutations in the coding regions of genes) or by altering the amount of protein (through changes in transcriptional regulation). The latter type of evolution can be achieved by substitutions in the promoter of the gene of interest (cis‐regulatory change) or by altering the structure or amount of transcriptional regulator proteins (trans‐regulatory change). The metallothionein system is one of the best studied stress response systems in the context of heavy metals.

The severity of the phenotype does not correlate with the level of steady-state mRNA in mature leaves. but with the timing of cre expression during organogenesis. The early onset of cre expression in tomato is correlated with a more severe phenotype and with higher germinal transmission frequencies of site-specific deletions.

Sequencing and assembling the transcriptome of P. chalceus is a first step in developing large scale genetic information that will allow us to further study the recurrent phenotypic evolution in dispersal traits in these natural populations.   Methodology/Results We used the Illumina HiSeq2000 to sequence 37 Gbases of the transcriptome and performed de novo transcriptome assembly with the Trinity short read assembler. This resulted in 65.766 contigs. clustering into 39.393 unique transcripts (unigenes). A subset of 12.987 show similarity (BLAST) to known proteins in the NCBI database and 7.589 are assigned Gene Ontology (GO). Using homology searches we identified all reported genes involved in wing development. juvenile- and ecdysteroid hormone pathways in Tribolium castaneum. About half (56.7%) of the unique assembled genes are shared among three life stages (third-instar larva. pupa. and imago). We identified 38.141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these unigenes. Of these SNPs. 26.823 (70.3%) were found in a predicted open reading frame (ORF) and 6.998 (18.3%) were nonsynonymous.

One of the challenged hypotheses is the monophyly of hexapods. This discussion originated from analyses based on mitochondrial DNA datasets that. due to an unusual positioning of Collembola. suggested that the hexapod body plan evolved at least twice. Here. we re-evaluate the position of Collembola using ribosomal protein gene sequences. In total 48 ribosomal proteins were obtained for the collembolan Folsomia candida. These 48 sequences were aligned with sequence data on 35 other ecdysozoans. Each ribosomal protein gene was available for 25% to 86% of the taxa.

Recent genetic analyses confirmed the existence of only two closely related species. Aplochiton taeniatus and Aplochiton zebra. while a third controversial species. Aplochiton marinus. remained lost to synonymy with A. taeniatus. Using an integrative taxonomy framework. we studied original samples and published sequences from a broad range in western Patagonia and the Falkland Islands. and generated robust species hypotheses based on single-locus (Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I; COI) species-delineation methods and known diagnostic morphological characters analyzed in a multivariate context. Results revealed three distinct evolutionary lineages that morphologically resemble. in important respects. existing nominal species descriptions. Interestingly. the lineage associated with A. marinus was unambiguously identifiable (100% accuracy) both from the genetic and morphological viewpoints. In contrast. the morphology of A. taeniatus and A. zebra overlapped substantially. mainly due to the high variability of A. taeniatus. Discriminant function analysis aided the identification of these species with 83.9% accuracy. Hence. for their unambiguous identification. genetic screening is needed. A. marinus has seldom been documented. and when recorded. it has always been found in sites with clear marine influence.

We investigated the origins of a complex wing pattern found among Amazonian Heliconius butterflies. Genome sequence data from 142 individuals across 17 species identified narrow regions associated with two distinct red colour pattern elements. dennis and ray. We hypothesise that these modules in non-coding sequence represent distinct cis-regulatory loci that control expression of the transcription factor optix. which in turn controls red pattern variation across Heliconius. Phylogenetic analysis of the two elements demonstrated that they have distinct evolutionary histories and that novel adaptive morphological variation was created by shuffling these cis-regulatory modules through recombination between divergent lineages. In addition. recombination of modules into different combinations within species further contributes to diversity. Analysis of the timing of diversification in these two regions supports the hypothesis of introgression moving regulatory modules between species. rather than shared ancestral variation. The dennis phenotype introgressed into Heliconius melpomene at about the same time that ray originated in this group. while ray introgressed back into H. elevatus much more recently.

Recent work in Heliconius butterflies takes advantage of genomic approaches and offers insights into how the diversification of wing patterns is overlaid onto this conserved network.

Multiple examples of cis-regulatory evolution have been described at pattern switch genes responsible for butterfly wing pattern polymorphism. including in the diverse neotropical genus Heliconius. but the identities of the factors that can regulate these switch genes have not been identified.  We investigated the spatial transcriptomic landscape across the wings of three closely related butterfly species. two of which have a convergently evolved co-mimetic pattern and the other having a divergent pattern. We identified candidate factors for regulating the expression of wing patterning genes. including transcription factors with a conserved expression profile in all three species. and others. including both transcription factors and Wnt pathway genes. with markedly different profiles in each of the three species. We verified the conserved expression profile of the transcription factor homothorax by immunofluorescence and showed that its expression profile strongly correlates with that of the selector gene optix in butterflies with the Amazonian forewing pattern element ‘dennis.’ Here we show that. in addition to factors with conserved expression profiles like homothorax. there are also a variety of transcription factors and signaling pathway components that appear to vary in their expression profiles between closely related butterfly species. highlighting the importance of genome-wide regulatory evolution between species.,True,UFFlhm4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,8,https://evodevojournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13227-019-0127-4?optIn=true,13095798324648630123,/scholar?cites=13095798324648630123,,https://evodevojournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13227-019-0127-4?optIn=true,0,0,0
1190950,Developmental basis of wing pattern diversity in Heliconius butterflies,2017,Joseph Hanly,,,,,,A major challenge to evolutionary developmental biology is to understand the how modifications to gene regulatory networks can lead to biological diversity. Heliconius butterfly wing patterns provide an excellent example of this diversity. In particular. the species H. melpomene and H. erato display wide variation in wing pattern across their ranges in Central and South America. but wherever they co-occur. they have converged on remarkably similar wing patterns due to Müllerian mimicry.   Linkage analysis of wing pattern genes has shown that in both species. there are three genomic loci that are responsible for most of the pattern variation. and that these loci are homologous. One locus. containing the transcription factor optix. is responsible for red pattern elements. A set of non-coding sequences linked to some of the red pattern elements have been identified. Another locus. containing the gene WntA. has been linked to the shape of the forewing band elements and is responsible for variation in wing pattern development in several species of lepidoptera. A third locus. responsible for yellow pattern elements. contains multiple candidate genes that may affect wing pattern development. including the gene cortex. which is also linked to the industrial melanism phenotype in the moth Biston betularia. as well as the genes domeless and washout. linked to the Bigeye mutant in Bicyclus anynana.   I first investigated modifications to regulatory sequence near the transcription factor optix. detecting a module associated with the band pattern element.

Amongst these structural colors are broadband metallic reflections. which have been previously linked to an ultrathin broadband reflector in the nymphalid butterfly Argyrophorus argenteus. To test if similar optical modes of broadband. specular reflectance have evolved in other butterfly taxa. we characterized the reflective scales of eight species from five Papilionoidea families using microspectrophotometry (MSP). light microscopy in reflected and transmitted modes. and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In Nymphalidae. Pieridae. and Hesperidae. and Lycaenidae. we find that broadband specularity is due to spatial mixing of densely juxtaposed colorful reflectances that change across microscale distances (eg. 1–3 µm). These seemingly convergent silver scales are unpigmented. show a continuous upper lamina with reduced windows. and consist of an air-cuticle sandwich of variable thickness. forming an undulatory thin-film. Strikingly. Hypochrysops apelles (Lycaenidae) shows a novel mode of silver reflectance with spatial color mixing occurring across the entire proximo-distal length of the scale (> 100 µm). transitioning from blue to red hues between the stem and the tip of the scales. Unlike the undulatory type. this reflector shows flat thin-films which also includes a multilayered lower lamina. responsible for selective color iridescence in other lycaenids or in sunset moths.

The incredibly diverse patterns are generated from an array of pigmented scales on a largely two dimensional surface. resulting in a visibly tractable system for studying the evolution of pigmentation. In Heliconius butterflies. much of this diversity is controlled by a few genes of large effect that regulate pattern switches between races and species across a large mimetic radiation. One of these genes. cortex. has been repeatedly mapped in association with colour pattern evolution in both Heliconius and other Lepidoptera. but we lack functional data supporting its role in modulating wing patterns. Here we carried out CRISPR knock-outs in multiple Heliconius species and show that cortex is a major determinant scale cell identity. Mutant wing clones lacking cortex showed shifts in colour identity. with melanic and red scales acquiring a yellow or white state. These homeotic transformations include changes in both pigmentation and scale ultrastructure. suggesting that cortex acts during early stages of scale cell fate specification rather than during the deployment of effector genes. In addition. mutant clones were observed across the entire wing surface. contrasting with other known Heliconius mimicry loci that act in specific patterns. Cortex is known as a cell-cycle regulator that modulates mitotic entry in Drosophila. and we found the Cortex protein to accumulate in the nuclei of the polyploid scale building cells of the butterfly wing epithelium. speculatively suggesting a connection between scale cell endocycling and colour identity.

Among butterflies. research on species within the genus Heliconius has provided remarkable opportunities to explore how phenotypic diversity is generated within the context of an extraordinary adaptive radiation. Wing pattern diversity among the 48 species and hundreds of intraspecific variants arose within the last 12–14 million years and includes striking pattern convergence between distantly related species. as well as marked pattern divergence between closely related populations and species. Here. we synthesize recent research aimed at gaining a mechanistic understanding of how this variation is generated. This research integrates decades of controlled crossing experiments. and the discovery of major wing patterning genes (optix. aristaless1. WntA and cortex) with recent functional genetic manipulation using CRISPR/Cas9 targeted mutagenesis. The emerging data provides a rich framework with which to explore the repeatability of evolution. particularly within the context of how natural selection acts on divergent gene regulatory networks to generate both highly convergent. as well as highly divergent phenotypes. Overall. the functional data show that the gene regulatory networks underlying pattern variation diverge rapidly in Heliconius; yet these networks retain enough flexibility so that natural selection can drive the evolution of nearly identical patterns from different …,True,UFFlhm4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/308871,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/308871/fevo-08-00221.pdf?sequence=4,0,0,0

TCP. and MPI,2016,Eric Gamess and Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga,,"IV Simposio Científico y Tecnológico en Computación, Caracas, Venezuela",,,,Linux-based clusters and commodity hardware are becoming more prevalent in the field of HPC (High Performance Computing). replacing the expensive proprietary solutions. and making HPC more affordable. Hence. the community has developed all-in-one software solutions to rapidly deploy HPC clusters. based on the integration of different open source projects into a Linux distribution. allowing provisioning. configuration. management. and monitoring. Rocks Cluster is a famous cluster manager solution that has been widely accepted in academic. governmental. and commercial environments. since it is open source. it has been actively developed. and its main objective is to make easier the life cycle of a HPC cluster. Network performance evaluation at different protocol level is crucial for the management and administration of such clusters. since it allows the validation and troubleshooting of the networking system. To assist in this process. several benchmarking tools have been proposed. with their own limitations and strengths. reporting evaluation results at different levels of the OSI model. In this paper. we describe some popular tools for network measurement. at the most important levels for HPC developers: UDP. TCP. and MPI (Message Passing Interface). We do some experiments in a testbed environment.

1190977,Low level performance evaluation of InfiniBand with benchmarking tools,2016,Eric Gamess and Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga,8,International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security,10,12,Modern Education and Computer Science Press,InfiniBand is widely accepted as a high performance networking technology for datacenters and HPC clusters. It uses the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) where communication tasks that are typically assigned to CPUs are offloaded to the Channel Adapters (CAs). resulting in a significant increase of the throughput and reduction of the latency and CPU load. In this paper. we make an introduction to InfiniBand and IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB). where the latter is a protocol proposed by the IETF to run traditional socket-oriented applications on top of InfiniBand networks. We also evaluate the performance of InfiniBand using different transport protocols with several benchmarking tools in a testbed. For RDMA communications. we consider three transport services:(1) Reliable Connection.(2) Unreliable Connection. and (3) Unreliable Datagram. For UDP and TCP. we use IPoIB. Our results show significant differences between RDMA and IPoIB communications. encouraging the coding of new applications with InfiniBand verbs. Also. it is noticeable that IPoIB in datagram mode and in connected mode have similar performance for small UDP and TCP payload.

1190978,Analytical Performance Evaluation of IPv6 and IPv4 Over 10 Gigabit Ethernet and InfiniBand using IPoIB,2016,Eric Gamess and Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga,7,International Journal Of Advanced Computer Science And Applications,8,214-222,SCIENCE & INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD,IPv6 is the response to the shortage of IPv4 addresses. It was defined almost twenty years ago by the IETF as a replacement of IPv4. and little by little. it is becoming more preponderant as the Internet protocol. The growth of Internet has led to the development of high performance networks. On one hand. Ethernet has evolved significantly and today it is common to find 10 Gigabit Ethernet networks in LANs. On the other hand. another approach for high performance networking is based on RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) which offers innovative features such as kernel bypass. zero copy. offload of splitting and assembly of messages in packets to the CAs (Channel Adapters). etc. InfiniBand is currently the most popular technology that implements RDMA. It uses verbs instead of sockets and a big effort of the community is required to port TCP/IP software to InfiniBand. to take advantage of its benefits. Meanwhile. IPoIB (IP over InfiniBand) is a protocol that has been proposed and permits the execution of socket-based applications on top of InfiniBand. without any change. at the expense of performance. In this paper. we make a performance evaluation of IPv6 and IPv4 over 10 Gigabit Ethernet and IPoIB. Our results show that 10 Gigabit Ethernet has a better throughput than IPoIB. especially for small and medium payload sizes. However. as the payload size increases. the advantage of 10 Gigabit Ethernet is reduced in comparison to IPoIB/FDR. With respect to latency. IPoIB did much better than 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Finally. our research also indicates that in a controlled environment. IPv4 has a better performance than IPv6.,True,jlRDnO8AAAAJ:I9gX6wnfuA8C,3,https://www.academia.edu/download/61665603/IJACSA-Gamess-Ortiz-Official20200102-44908-hle0lp.pdf,3390576505051923848,/scholar?cites=3390576505051923848,,https://www.academia.edu/download/61665603/IJACSA-Gamess-Ortiz-Official20200102-44908-hle0lp.pdf,0,0,0

Previous studies from our group suggested that factors known to function in DNA recombination/repair machineries. such as DNA ligases. polymerases. and DNA endonucleases. play a role in LTM. Here we report data using C57BL/6 mice showing that the V(D)J recombination-activating gene 1 (RAG1). which encodes a factor that introduces DSBs in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. is induced in the amygdala. but not in the hippocampus. after context fear conditioning. Amygdalar induction of RAG1 mRNA. measured by real-time PCR. was not observed in context-only or shock-only controls. suggesting that the context fear conditioning response is related to associative learning processes. Furthermore. double immunofluorescence studies demonstrated the neuronal localization of RAG1 protein in amygdalar sections prepared after perfusion and fixation. In functional studies. intra-amygdalar injections of RAG1 gapmer antisense oligonucleotides. given 1 h prior to conditioning. resulted in amygdalar knockdown of RAG1 mRNA and a significant impairment in LTM. tested 24 h after training.

Instead. there is. if anything. more disagreement about speciation than ever before. Even more surprisingly. 60 years after the biological species concept. in which species were considered to be reproductive communities isolated from other such communities. we still do not all accept a common definition of what a species is.

Host races in plant–feeding insects. in particular. have often been used as evidence for the probability of sympatric speciation. Here. we provide verifiable criteria to distinguish host races from other biotypes: in brief. host races are genetically differentiated. sympatric populations of parasites that use different hosts and between which there is appreciable gene flow. We recognize host races as kinds of species that regularly exchange genes with other species at a rate of more than ca. 1% per generation. rather than as fundamentally distinct taxa.

Here we show that a shift in colour pattern mimicry was crucial in the origin of two butterfly species. The sister species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno recently diverged to mimic different model taxa. and our experiments show that their mimetic coloration is also important in choosing mates. Assortative mating between the sister species means that hybridization is rare in nature. and the few hybrids that are produced are non-mimetic. poorly adapted intermediates. Thus. the mimetic shift has caused both pre-mating and post-mating isolation. In addition. individuals from a population of H. melpomene allopatric to H. cydno court and mate with H. cydno more readily than those from a sympatric population.

Color patterns in both Müllerian and Batesian mimicry are often determined by relatively few pattern-regulating loci with major effects.

On the one hand. strong purifying selection on these genes must explain accurate resemblance (a reduction of morphological diversity between species). as well as monomorphic color patterns within species. On the other hand. mimicry has diversified at every taxonomic level; warning color has evolved from cryptic patterns. and there are mimetic polymorphisms within species. multiple color patterns in different geographic races of the same species. mimetic differences between sister species. and multiple mimicry rings within local communities.

Interspecific hybrids occur regularly in Heliconius and Eueides (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the wild: 26–29% of the species of Heliconiina are involved. depending on species concept employed. Hybridization is. however. rare on a per-individual basis. For one well-studied case of species hybridizing in parapatric contact (Heliconius erato and H. himera). phenotypically detectable hybrids form around 10% of the population. but for species in sympatry hybrids usually form less than 0.05% of individuals. There is a roughly exponential decline with genetic distance in the numbers of natural hybrids in collections. both between and within species. suggesting a simple ""exponential failure law"" of compatibility as found in some prokaryotes. Hybridization between species of Heliconius appears to be a natural phenomenon; there is no evidence that it has been enhanced by recent human habitat disturbance. In some well-studied cases. backcrossing occurs in the field and fertile backcrosses have been verified in insectaries. which indicates that introgression is likely. and recent molecular work shows that alleles at some but not all loci are exchanged between pairs of sympatric. hybridizing species. Molecular clock dating suggests that gene exchange may continue for more than 3 million years after speciation. In addition. one species.

Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence. and they have played an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and constraints in adaptive evolution. Here we contrast three butterfly species. all classic examples of Müllerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a locus. Yb. which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene. maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr. which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore. the same genomic location acts as a “supergene”. determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species. H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance. whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato. but they are not involved in mimetic polymorphism in H. numata. Hence. a single region from the multilocus colour pattern architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata. presumably as a result of selection for mimetic “supergene” polymorphism without intermediates.

The width of a cline in gene frequency is approximately proportional to gene flow (sigma) divided by the square root of per-locus selection (square root of s). Gene flow also causes gametic correlations (linkage disequilibria) between genes that differ across hybrid zones. Correlations are stronger when the hybrid zone is narrow. and rise to a maximum roughly equal to s. Thus cline width and gametic correlations combine to give estimates of gene flow and selection. These indirect measures of sigma and s are especially useful because they can be made from collections. and require no field experiments.

Here. we develop a genomic approach to test for divergent selection in sympatric host races of the larch budmoth Zeiraphera diniana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). We analysed hundreds of amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in 92 individuals in sympatric and allopatric populations. and in two backcross broods used to map the markers to individual chromosomes. The results directly confirm the existence of natural hybridization and demonstrate strong heterogeneity between chromosomes in terms of molecular divergence between host races (the average level of divergence was FST=0.216). However. genomic heterogeneity was not found when we analysed divergence between geographically separated populations of the same host race.

The term is used especially in the interbreeding and cohesion species concepts. Cohesion mechanisms include isolating mechanisms in sexual species as well as ‘‘stabilizing’’ecological selection. which may cause cohesion even within asexual lineages. disruptive selection Selection acting to preserve extreme phenotypes in a population.

Here we use comparative genomics. transcriptomics and resequencing to elucidate the genetic basis for their properties as pests. We find that. prior to their divergence about 1.5 Mya. the H. armigera/H. zea lineage had accumulated up to more than 100 more members of specific detoxification and digestion gene families and more than 100 extra gustatory receptor genes. compared to other lepidopterans with narrower host ranges.

This rapid growth in data has outstripped the ability of researchers working on non-model species to analyze and mine transcriptome data efficiently. Here we present a semi-automated platform 'est2assembly' that processes raw sequence data from Sanger or 454 sequencing into a hybrid de-novo assembly. annotates it and produces GMOD compatible output. including a SeqFeature database suitable for GBrowse. Users are able to parameterize assembler variables. judge assembly quality and determine the optimal assembly for their specific needs. We used est2assembly to process Drosophila and Bicyclus public Sanger EST data and then compared them to published 454 data as well as eight new insect transcriptome collections. Analysis of such a wide variety of data allows us to understand how these new technologies can assist EST project design.

The cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera is one of the most destructive pest species that can feed on over 200 different plant species. This diversity of host plants is likely linked to a complex chemosensory system. Here we built on previous work to characterize crucial chemosensory tissues linked to environmental interactions including larval antennae. larval mouthparts and larval fat bodies. as well as male and female adult heads. male and female adult tarsi. and female abdomens. Using transcriptome sequencing. Trinity RNA-seq assemblies and extensive manual curation. we identified a total of 91 candidate chemosensory receptors (60 candidate ORs. 10 GRs and 21 IRs). Thirty-five of these candidates present full-length transcripts. First. we performed in silico differential expression analysis on different sequenced tissues. Further. we created extensive expression profiles using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR on a variety of adult and larval stages. We found that the expression profile of HarmOR51 was limited to adult male antenna suggesting a role in mating that was further supported by a phylogenetic analysis clustering it into the pheromone receptor clade. HarmOR51 in calcium imaging analysis did not show responses to either of the two H. armigera sex pheromone components (Z9-16:Ald or Z11-16:Ald) inviting a future detailed study.

Positional cloning and candidate gene studies have identified a handful of regulatory and pigmentation genes implicated in Heliconius wing pattern variation. but little is known about the greater developmental networks within which these genes interact to pattern a wing. Here we took a large-scale transcriptomic approach to identify the network of genes involved in Heliconius wing pattern development and variation. This included applying over 140 transcriptome microarrays to assay gene expression in dissected wing pattern elements across a range of developmental stages and wing pattern morphs of Heliconius erato. We identified a number of putative early prepattern genes with color-pattern related expression domains. We also identified 51 genes differentially expressed in association with natural color pattern variation. Of these. the previously identified color pattern “switch gene” optix was recovered as the first transcript to show color-specific differential expression. Most differentially expressed genes were transcribed late in pupal development and have roles in cuticle formation or pigment synthesis. These include previously undescribed transporter genes associated with ommochrome pigmentation.

However. with 38 subgenera in recent lists for about 250 species. the system has come to be seen as too complicated. In this paper we suggest four criteria to guide the process of simplifying the subgeneric system. so that ideally subgenera should become:(1) monophyletic;(2) fewer;(3) diagnosable from morphology; and (4) names for important behavioural and ecological groups.

The genes controlling pattern variation are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect. where allelic variation causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium (LD). and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern. we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old. However. across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. Interestingly. coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated. suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites. conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as “supergenes.” Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic.

Positional cloning and candidate gene studies have identified a handful of regulatory and pigmentation genes implicated in Heliconius wing pattern variation. but little is known about the greater developmental networks within which these genes interact to pattern a wing. Here we took a large-scale transcriptomic approach to identify the network of genes involved in Heliconius wing pattern development and variation. This included applying over 140 transcriptome microarrays to assay gene expression in dissected wing pattern elements across a range of developmental stages and wing pattern morphs of Heliconius erato. We identified a number of putative early prepattern genes with color-pattern related expression domains. We also identified 51 genes differentially expressed in association with natural color pattern variation. Of these. the previously identified color pattern “switch gene” optix was recovered as the first transcript to show color-specific differential expression. Most differentially expressed genes were transcribed late in pupal development and have roles in cuticle formation or pigment synthesis. These include previously undescribed transporter genes associated with ommochrome pigmentation.

Furthermore. the “helmet” was interpreted to share multiple characteristics with wings. which in extant pterygote insects are present only on the 2nd (T2) and 3rd (T3) thoracic segments. In this context. the “helmet” could be considered an evolutionary novelty. Although multiple lines of morphological evidence putatively supported the “helmet”-wing homology. the relationship of the “helmet” to other thoracic sclerites and muscles remained unclear. Our observations of exemplar thoraces of 10 hemipteran families reveal multiple misinterpretations relevant to the “helmet”-wing homology hypothesis as originally conceived: 1) the “helmet” actually represents T1 (excluding the fore legs); 2) the “T1 tergum” is actually the anterior dorsal area of T2; 3) the putative articulation between the “helmet” and T1 is actually the articulation between T1 and T2. We conclude that there is no dorsal. articulated appendage on the membracid T1. Although the posterior. flattened. cuticular evagination (PFE) of the membracid T1 does share structural and genetic attributes with wings. the PFE is actually widely distributed across Hemiptera. Hence. the presence of this structure in Membracidae is not an evolutionary novelty for this clade.

In bees. this division of labor allows queens and workers to phenotypically specialize. Worker traits associated with helping are thought to be crucial to the fitness of a eusocial lineage. and recent studies of honey bees (genus Apis) have found that adaptively evolving genes often have worker-biased expression patterns.

Until now. the phylogenetic placement of this species has not been analyzed quantitatively because it is rare in nature. Here a specimen of B. inexspectatus is sequenced for five genes to assess its phylogenetic position relative to other bumble bee species. Phylogenetic estimation of B. inexspectatus places this species within the subgenus Thoracobombus. as expected based on morphology. This provides strong support for the acquisition of social parasitism in B. inexspectatus separate from that found in the bumble bees of the subgenus Psithyrus and B. (Alpinobombus) hyperboreus.

Bees obtain their protein and lipid nutrient intake from pollen. which is essential for larval growth and development as well as adult health and reproduction. Our previous research revealed that pollen protein to lipid ratios (P: L) shape bumble bee foraging preferences among pollen host-plant species. and these preferred ratios link to bumble bee colony health and fitness. Yet. we are still in the early stages of integrating data on P: L ratios across plant and bee species. Here. using a standard laboratory protocol. we present over 80 plant species’ protein and lipid concentrations and P: L values. and we evaluate the P: L ratios of pollen collected by three bee species. We discuss the general phylogenetic. phenotypic. behavioral. and ecological trends observed in these P: L ratios that may drive plant–pollinator interactions; we also present future research questions to further strengthen the field of pollination nutritional ecology.

1191058,Melanic variation underlies aposematic color variation in two hymenopteran mimicry systems,2017,Heather M Hines and Paige Witkowski and Joseph S Wilson and Kazumasa Wakamatsu,12,PloS one,7,e0182135,Public Library of Science,The stinging hymenopteran velvet ants (Mutillidae) and bumble bees (Apidae: Bombus spp.) have both undergone extensive diversification in aposematic color patterns. including yellow-red hues and contrasting dark-light body coloration. as a result of Müllerian mimicry. Understanding the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying shifts in these mimetic colors requires characterization of their pigmentation. In this study. a combination of solubility. spectrophotometry. and melanin degradation analysis are applied to several color forms and species of these lineages to determine that orange-red colors in both lineages are comprised of primarily dopamine-derived pheomelanins. Until a few recent studies. pheomelanins were thought not to occur in insects. These results support their potential to occur across insects and particularly among the Hymenoptera. Shifts between black and orange-red colors. such as between mimetic color forms of bumble bee Bombus melanopygus. are inferred to involve modification of the ratios of dark eumelanins to red pheomelanins. thus implicating the melanin pathway in mimetic diversification. This discovery highlights the need to focus on how pheomelanins are synthesized in the insect melanin pathway and the potential for new pigments to be found even in some of our most well-known insect systems.,True,N4wh9f8AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182135,6106368775950039480,/scholar?cites=6106368775950039480,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182135,0,0,0

This work aims at providing a general evaluation of insect DNA barcoding and ""mini-barcoding"" by performing simulations on a large database of 15.948 DNA barcodes. We compared the proportions of correctly identified queries across a) six insect orders (Coleoptera. Diptera. Hemiptera. Hymenoptera.

Analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences among ID criteria and insect orders.

1191064,Exploring the use of cytochrome oxidase c subunit 1 (COI) for DNA barcoding of free-living marine nematodes,2010,Sofie Derycke and Jan Vanaverbeke and Annelien Rigaux and Thierry Backeljau and Tom Moens,5,PloS one,10,e13716,Public Library of Science,Background The identification of free-living marine nematodes is difficult because of the paucity of easily scorable diagnostic morphological characters. Consequently. molecular identification tools could solve this problem. Unfortunately. hitherto most of these tools relied on 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA sequences. which often lack sufficient resolution at the species level. In contrast. only a few mitochondrial COI data are available for free-living marine nematodes. Therefore. we investigate the amplification and sequencing success of two partitions of the COI gene. the M1-M6 barcoding region and the I3-M11 partition.   Methodology Both partitions were analysed in 41 nematode species from a wide phylogenetic range. The taxon specific primers for the I3-M11 partition outperformed the universal M1-M6 primers in terms of amplification success (87.8% vs. 65.8%. respectively) and produced a higher number of bidirectional COI sequences (65.8% vs 39.0%. respectively). A threshold value of 5% K2P genetic divergence marked a clear DNA barcoding gap separating intra- and interspecific distances: 99.3% of all interspecific comparisons were >0.05. while 99.5% of all intraspecific comparisons were <0.05 K2P distance.   Conclusion The I3-M11 partition reliably identifies a wide range of marine nematodes. and our data show the need for a strict scrutiny of the obtained sequences. since contamination. nuclear pseudogenes and endosymbionts may confuse nematode species identification by COI sequences.,True,AxFLn5kAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,193,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013716,5821198224645234365,/scholar?cites=5821198224645234365,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013716,0,0,0

The malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis have developed resistance to pyrethroid insecticides as a result of a mechanism conferring reduced nervous system sensitivity. better known as knockdown resistance (kdr). In An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. two different substitutions in the para-type sodium channel. a L1014F substitution common in West Africa and a L1014S replacement found in Kenya. are linked with kdr. Two different allele-specific polymerase chain reactions (AS-PCR) are needed to detect these known kdr mutations. However. these AS-PCR assays rely on a single nucleotide polymorphism mismatch. which can result in unreliable results. Here. a new assay for the detection of knockdown resistance in An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/Melt Curve analysis (FRET/MCA) is presented and compared with the existing assays. The new FRET/MCA method has the important advantage of detecting both kdr alleles in one assay. Moreover. results show that the FRET/MCA is more reliable and more sensitive than the existing AS-PCR assays and is able to detect new genotypes.

Great strides have been made in the past decade establishing a framework for sharing data. where taxonomy and systematics has been perceived as the most prominent discipline involved. To some extent this is inevitable. given the use of species names as the pivot around which information is organised. To address the urgent questions around conservation. land-use. environmental change. sustainability. food security and ecosystem services that are facing Governments worldwide. we need to understand how the ecosystem works. So. we need a systems approach to understanding biodiversity that moves significantly beyond taxonomy and species observations. Such an approach needs to look at the whole system to address species interactions. both with their environment and with other species. It is clear that some barriers to progress are sociological. basically persuading people to use the technological solutions that are already available. This is best addressed by developing more effective systems that deliver immediate benefit to the user. hiding the majority of the technology behind simple user interfaces.

Due to varying selection pressures among host individuals. herbivorous insects may show local adaptation at the individual level. In the winter moth. synchrony of egg hatching and host tree (Quercus robur L.) budburst may have important fitness consequences and. therefore. may result in a local adaptation to the hosts phenology. However. relatively high gene flow levels may disrupt such a fine-scale adaption. 2. We determined hatching dates of clutches laid by females collected during copulation. and variation in budburst dates of the trees on which these couples were collected. 3.

Especially species with a high degree of cold tolerance. limited requirements towards habitat preferences. and relatively low active dispersal capacities may have responded in a different way to the Pleistocene climatological fluctuations than the majority of taxa studied so far. To evaluate this possibility. we studied Arion fuscus (Müller. 1774). a common and widespread European terrestrial slug. from 88 locations (N = 964). Sequence variation was assessed for fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rDNA and COI genes by means of single‐strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCP) and subsequent DNA sequencing.

Considering that (1) queries with a large genetic distance with their best DNA barcode match are more likely to be misidentified and (2) imposing a distance threshold profitably reduces identification errors. we modelled relationships between identification performances and distance thresholds in four DNA barcode libraries of Diptera (n = 4270). Lepidoptera (n = 7577). Hymenoptera (n = 2067) and Tephritidae (n = 602 DNA barcodes). In all cases. more restrictive distance thresholds produced a gradual increase in the proportion of true negatives. a gradual decrease of false positives and more abrupt variations in the proportions of true positives and false negatives. More restrictive distance thresholds improved precision. yet negatively affected accuracy due to the higher proportions of queries discarded (viz. having a distance query-best match above the threshold). Using a simple linear regression we calculated an ad hoc distance threshold for the tephritid library producing an estimated relative identification error <0.05. According to the expectations. when we used this threshold for the identification of 188 independently collected tephritids. less than 5% of queries with a distance query-best match below the threshold were misidentified. Ad hoc thresholds can be calculated for each particular reference library of DNA barcodes and should be used as cut-off mark defining whether we can proceed identifying the query with a known estimated error probability (e.g. 5%) or whether we should discard the query and consider …,True,AxFLn5kAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC,84,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031581,16526415653795068580,/scholar?cites=16526415653795068580,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0031581,0,0,0

There is increasing evidence that such cases of rapid parallel evolution are fueled by standing genetic variation. but the source of this genetic variation remains poorly understood. In the saltmarsh beetle Pogonus chalceus. short-winged ‘tidal’ and long-winged ‘seasonal’ ecotypes have diverged in response to contrasting hydrological regimes and can be repeatedly found along the Atlantic European coast. By analyzing genomic variation across the beetles’ distribution. we reveal that alleles selected in the tidal ecotype are spread across the genome and evolved during a singular and. likely. geographically isolated divergence event. within the last 190 Kya. Due to subsequent admixture. the ancient and differentially selected alleles are currently polymorphic in most populations across its range. which could potentially allow for the fast evolution of one ecotype from a small number of random individuals. as low as 5 to 15. from a population of the other ecotype. Our results suggest that cases of fast parallel ecological divergence can be the result of evolution at two different time frames: divergence in the past. followed by repeated selection on the same divergently evolved alleles after admixture. These findings highlight the importance of an ancient and. likely. allopatric divergence event for driving the rate and direction of contemporary fast evolution under gene flow.

By analysing high-coverage genome sequence data from 4 major colour pattern loci sampled from nearly 600 individuals in 53 populations. we show pervasive selection on wing patterns in the Heliconius adaptive radiation. The strongest signatures correspond to loci with the greatest phenotypic effects. consistent with visual selection by predators. and are found in colour patterns with geographically restricted distributions. These recent sweeps are similar between co-mimics and indicate colour pattern turn-over events despite strong stabilising selection. Using simulations. we compare sweep signatures expected under classic hard sweeps with those resulting from adaptive introgression. an important aspect of mimicry evolution in Heliconius butterflies. Simulated recipient populations show a distinct ‘volcano’ pattern with peaks of increased genetic diversity around the selected target. characteristic ofsweeps of introgressed variation and consistent with diversity patterns found in some populations.

While these methods can be applied to all possible kind of species. the underlying assumptions are sexual reproduction in each generation and non-overlapping generations. However. in many plants. invertebrates. fungi and other taxa. those assumptions are often violated due to different ecological and life history traits. such as self-fertilization or long term dormant structures (seed or egg-banking). We develop a novel SMC-based method to infer 1) the rates/parameters of dormancy and of self-fertilization. and 2) the populations’ past demographic history. Using simulated data sets. we demonstrate the accuracy of our method for a wide range of demographic scenarios and for sequence lengths from one to 30 Mb using four sampled genomes.

We characterize nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium (LD). and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern. we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old.

Interestingly. coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated. suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites. conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as “supergenes.” Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic.

Heliconius butterflies display an extraordinary diversity of wing patterns due in part to mimicry and sexual selection. Identifying the genetic drivers of this crucible of evolution is now within reach. as it was recently shown that cis-regulatory variation of the optix transcription factor explains red pattern differences in the adaptive radiations of the Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato species groups.

This behaviour has been hypothesized to be beneficial in terms of information sharing and/or anti-predator defence. To better understand the adaptive value of communal roosting. we tested these two hypotheses in field studies. The information-sharing hypothesis was addressed by examining following behaviour of butterflies departing from natural roosts. We found no evidence of roost mates following one another to resources. thus providing no support for this hypothesis. The anti-predator defence hypothesis was tested using avian-indiscriminable Heliconius erato models placed singly and in aggregations at field sites. A significantly higher number of predation attempts were observed on solitary models versus aggregations of models.

This delay in dispersal was caused by an extended period between fledging and dispersal. In second broods. the delay was even longer due to the interbrood interval being 9 days longer in habitat fragments. As nestlings in habitat fragments had a lower body‐mass. and age at dispersal was negatively correlated with nestling body‐mass within each nest. the postponed dispersal from fragments might be explained partly by a lower body‐mass. Alternatively. postponed dispersal from fragments could result from a barrier effect caused by reluctance to cross inhospitable habitat.Immigration by young from first broods into habitat fragments was delayed by approximately 3 weeks. and proportionally more second …,True,zAW8IjUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,104,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb01078.x,15353866286034850164,/scholar?cites=15353866286034850164,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andre_Dhondt/publication/230225386_Effects_of_habitat_fragmentation_on_the_timing_of_Crested_Tit_Pnrus_cristntus_dispersal/links/5caf6845299bf120975ea651/Effects-of-habitat-fragmentation-on-the-timing-of-Crested-Tit-Pnrus-cristntus-dispersal.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we characterize the evolution of regulatory loci in butterflies and moths using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) annotation of regulatory elements across three stages of head development. In the process we provide a high-quality. functionally annotated genome assembly for the butterfly. Heliconius erato. Comparing cis-regulatory element conservation across six lepidopteran genomes. we find that regulatory sequences evolve at a pace similar to that of protein-coding regions. We also observe that elements active at multiple developmental stages are markedly more conserved than elements with stage-specific activity.

However. fluorescent proteins are limited by slow chromophore maturation times and the cellular autofluorescence or phototoxicity that arises from light excitation. An alternative is luciferase. an enzyme that emits photons and is active upon folding. The photon flux per luciferase is significantly lower than that for fluorescent proteins. Thus time-lapse luminescence microscopy has been successfully used to track gene dynamics only in larger organisms and for slower processes. for which more total photons can be collected in one exposure. Here we tested green. yellow. and red beetle luciferases and optimized substrate conditions for in vivo luminescence.

Alternative plastic phenotypes can be selected through a process called genetic assimilation. although the mechanisms are still poorly understood. We assimilated a seasonal wing color phenotype in a naturally plastic population of butterflies (Junonia coenia) and characterized three responsible genes. Endocrine assays and chromatin accessibility and conformation analyses showed that the transition of wing coloration from an environmentally determined trait to a predominantly genetic trait occurred through selection for regulatory alleles of downstream wing-patterning genes.

To help undergraduate students learn about speciation. we designed a student-centered lesson that uses active-learning techniques (eg. clicker questions. small group work. and whole class discussion) and compares multiple species concepts (morphological. biological. and phylogenetic) using giraffes as an example. Giraffes were chosen as the focus of this lesson because they are familiar and have broad appeal to students; are in danger of becoming extinct; and have ecological. economic. and cultural importance. Students also learn about contemporary giraffe conservation issues and the current debate in the literature regarding the total number of giraffe species. Students then apply their knowledge by working in small groups on speciation scenarios that highlight organisms across the tree of life. Student understanding is assessed using multiple-choice pre/posttest questions. in-class clicker questions with peer discussion. and exam questions.

In pregnant women foodborne infection can give rise to infection of the fetus resulting in miscarriage. In addition. the bacterium has recently been demonstrated to cause localized gastrointestinal symptoms. predominantly in immunocompetent individuals. The murine model of systemic L. monocytogenes infection has provided numerous insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis of this organism.

This ubiquity can be at least partly explained by the ability of the organism to grow at high osmolarity and reduced temperatures. a consequence of its ability to accumulate osmo- and cryoprotective compounds termed osmolytes. Single and multiple deletions of the known osmolyte transporters BetL. Gbu. and OpuC significantly reduce growth at low temperatures. During growth in brain heart infusion broth at 7°C. Gbu and OpuC had a more pronounced role in cryoprotection than did BetL. However. upon the addition of betaine to defined medium. the hierarchy of transporter importance shifted to Gbu > BetL > OpuC.

1191206,Hybrid geo-routing in urban vehicular networks,2013,Aisling O'Driscoll and Dirk Pesch,,,,63-70,IEEE,It is expected that future vehicular networks will consist of a combination of ad-hoc network and infrastructure components. Road Side Units (RSUs) will form part of the infrastructure element. However. it is anticipated that a fully deployed RSU infrastructure may not be economically feasible in the short term. therefore. a partial infrastructure in urban environments is more likely. at least initially while vehicular networks are being adopted. It is further likely that low vehicle penetration rates will exist while 802.11p On-Board Unit (OBU) technology is being rolled out. thus routing schemes should exploit infrastructure where available to improve packet delivery. This paper presents a hybrid vehicular routing protocol that facilitates unicast routing by dynamically changing its routing decisions in the presence of RSU infrastructure in order to maximise packet delivery rate.

Aiming for higher realism. simulators become increasingly complex. relying on detailed simulation models that are developed by different communities. With this trend. it also becomes difficult to understand all models in detail and researchers might lack the expert knowledge to parameterize such models properly. In this paper. we identify suboptimal default parameter values for physical layer effects in common simulation frameworks and show how they can negatively impact the results. We also review papers that use said simulation models and highlight that this is not simply a theoretical issue: We found that the majority of the papers simply copy these default parameter values or do not mention physical layer parameters at all.

1191217,A Framework for Supporting Structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Overlays over Large Scale Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs),2007,Aisling O’ Driscoll and Susan Rea and Dirk Pesch,,,,,,Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) share similar characteristics in terms of their design goals and the principles of their routing and applications. They also fundamentally address the same problem: How to provide seamless connectivity and services in a dynamic and decentralised environment. Given their parallel objectives. these technologies. if unified. will realise MANETs as a commercial technology and enable the development of widespread distributed applications for MANETs. Unfortunately the existing body of P2P research is not directly transferable to the MANET domain as current P2P overlay networks. originally designed for the Internet. do not adequately cope with highly dynamic and unstable wireless environments. Before structured P2P overlay networks can be successfully deployed in a resilient and efficient manner over MANETs. solutions for a number of issues must be proposed. Starting with a motivation. this paper outlines the outstanding issues and unsolved challenges in this research space. presents framework that aims to minimise the impact of node mobility and provide scalable reliable services and finally describes current approaches for adapting P2P overlays to ubiquitous environments.,True,4AibKuYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b4c2/72d9d8dd9160820c7bc0e51e76b0809f8edf.pdf,8719929508934462988,/scholar?cites=8719929508934462988,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b4c2/72d9d8dd9160820c7bc0e51e76b0809f8edf.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,Vehicular routing has been an extremely active research field in recent years with geo-routing protocols typically favoured over conventional topology based routing protocols due to their advantages in terms of scalability and lower overhead. Before a geo-routing protocol can transmit a packet. it must be aware of the position of the target node and is reliant upon a location service to supply this information. Therefore the correct and efficient operation of the routing protocol is entirely dependant on the accuracy of this information. In this paper. a simulation based analysis is conducted to determine the tolerance of a geo-routing protocol to position inaccuracy as reported by a location service.

Manual curation of the published literature was carried out in order to define the components of these pathways and the interactions between them. This information has been assembled into a large integrated directional network and represented graphically using the modified Edinburgh Pathway Notation (mEPN) scheme. The diagram includes detailed views of the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways. other pathogen recognition systems. NF-kappa-B. apoptosis. interferon signalling. MAP-kinase cascades. MHC antigen presentation and proteasome assembly. as well as selected views of the transcriptional networks they regulate. The integrated pathway includes a total of 496 unique proteins. the complexes formed between them and the processes in which they are involved. This produces a network of 2.170 nodes connected by 2.553 edges. The pathway diagram is a navigable visual aid for displaying a consensus view of the pathway information available for these systems. It is also a valuable resource for computational modelling and aid in the interpretation of functional genomics data.

In contrast. antiviral mechanisms initiated by interferon (IFN) signaling predominate in mammals. Whilst mammalian IFN-induced miRNA are known to inhibit specific viruses. it is not known whether host-directed microRNAs. downstream of IFN-signaling. have a role in mediating broad antiviral resistance. By performing an integrative. systematic. global analysis of RNA turnover utilizing 4-thiouridine labeling of newly transcribed RNA and pri/pre-miRNA in IFN-activated macrophages. we identify a new post-transcriptional viral defense mechanism mediated by miR-342-5p. On the basis of ChIP and site-directed promoter mutagenesis experiments. we find the synthesis of miR-342-5p is coupled to the antiviral IFN response via the IFN-induced transcription factor. IRF1. Strikingly. we find miR-342-5p targets mevalonate-sterol biosynthesis using a multihit mechanism suppressing the pathway at different functional levels: transcriptionally via SREBF2. post-transcriptionally via miR-33. and enzymatically via IDI1 and SC4MOL. Mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and enzymatic assays demonstrate the targeting mechanisms reduce intermediate sterol pathway metabolites and total cholesterol in macrophages. These results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which IFN regulates the sterol pathway.

Heidelberg,Efficient resolution of acute cytopathogenic cytomegalovirus infection through innate and adaptive host immune mechanisms is followed by lifelong maintenance of the viral genome in host tissues in a state of replicative latency. which is interrupted by episodes of virus reactivation for transmission. The establishment of latency is the result of aeons of co-evolution of cytomegaloviruses and their respective host species. Genetic adaptation of a particular cytomegalovirus to its specific host is reflected by private gene families not found in other members of the cytomegalovirus group. whereas basic functions of the viral replicative cycle are encoded by public gene families shared between different cytomegaloviruses or even with herpesviruses in general.

For murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). which serves as a model for HCMV. a gH/gL/gO complex functionally homologous to the HCMV gH/gL/gO complex has been described. Knock-out of MCMV gO does impair. but not abolish. virus spread indicating that also MCMV might form an alternative gH/gL complex.

MCK-2 has been extensively studied in vivo by others. It has been shown to be involved in attracting cells for virus dissemination and in regulating antiviral host responses.

There is evidence to suggest that latency is nevertheless a highly dynamic condition during which episodes of viral gene desilencing. which can be viewed as incomplete reactivations. cause intermittent antigenic activity that stimulates CD8 memory-effector T cells and drives their clonal expansion. These T cells are supposed to terminate reactivation before completion of the productive viral cycle. In this view.

Interstitial pneumonia is the most dreaded manifestation of CMV disease in the immunocompromised host. whereas in the immunocompetent host lung-infiltrating CD8 T cells confine the infection in nodular inflammatory foci and prevent viral pathology. By using murine CMV infection as a model. we provide evidence for a critical role of mast cells (MC) in the recruitment of protective CD8 T cells to the lungs. Systemic infection triggered degranulation selectively in infected MC. The viral activation of MC was associated with a wave of CC chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) in the serum of C57BL/6 mice that was MC-derived as verified by infection of MC-deficient KitW-sh/W-sh “sash” mutants. In these mutants. CD8 T cells were recruited less efficiently to the lungs. correlating with enhanced viral replication and delayed virus clearance. A causative role for MC was verified by MC reconstitution of “sash” mice restoring both. efficient CD8 T-cell recruitment and infection control.

For murine cytomegalovirus two alternative gH/gL complexes. gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/MCK-2. have been identified. A limitation of studies on viral tropism in vivo has been the difficulty in distinguishing between infection initiation by viral entry into first-hit target cells and subsequent cell-to-cell spread within tissues. As a new strategy to dissect these two events. we used a gO-transcomplemented ΔgO mutant for providing the gH/gL/gO complex selectively for the initial entry step. while progeny virions lack gO in subsequent rounds of infection. Whereas gH/gL/gO proved to be critical for establishing infection by efficient entry into diverse cell types. including liver macrophages. endothelial cells. and hepatocytes. it was dispensable for intra-tissue spread. Notably. the salivary glands. the source of virus for host-to-host transmission. represent an exception in that entry into virus-producing cells did not strictly depend on either the gH/gL/gO or the gH/gL/MCK-2 complex.

To clarify this conundrum. we generated recombinant murine CMVs (MCMVs) encoding well-characterized MHC-I epitopes at different positions within viral genes and observed strong immune responses and protection against viruses and tumor growth when the epitopes were expressed at the protein C-terminus. We used the M45-encoded conventional epitope HGIRNASFI to dissect this phenomenon at the molecular level. A recombinant MCMV expressing HGIRNASFI on the C-terminus of M45. in contrast to wild-type MCMV. enabled peptide processing by the constitutive proteasome. direct antigen presentation. and an inflation of antigen-specific effector memory cells.

Here. we reveal that the murine CMV (MCMV) protein m152 specifically targets the type I interferon (IFN) response by binding to stimulator of interferon genes (STING). thereby delaying its trafficking to the Golgi compartment from where STING initiates type I IFN signaling. Infection with an MCMV lacking m152 induced elevated type I IFN responses and this leads to reduced viral transcript levels both in vitro and in vivo. This effect is ameliorated in the absence of STING. Interestingly. while m152 inhibits STING‐mediated IRF signaling. it did not affect STING‐mediated NF‐κB signaling. Analysis of how m152 targets STING translocation reveals that STING activates NF‐κB signaling already from the ER prior to its trafficking to the Golgi.

Here. we report on our experience with using BAC technology for a designed modulation of viral antigenicity and immunogenicity with focus on the CD8 T-cell response.

The experimental study of immunity against CMV in animal models of infection. such as the infection of mice with the mouse CMV (MCMV). has relied on systemic intraperitoneal infection protocols. although the infection naturally transmits by mucosal routes via body fluids containing CMV. To characterize the biology of infections by mucosal routes. we have compared the kinetics of virus replication. the latent viral load. and CD8 T cell responses in lymphoid organs upon experimental intranasal and intragastric infection to intraperitoneal infection of two unrelated mouse strains. We have observed that intranasal infection induces robust and persistent virus replication in lungs and salivary glands. but a poor one in the spleen. CD8 T cell responses were somewhat weaker than upon intraperitoneal infection. but showed similar kinetic profiles and phenotypes of antigen-specific cells. On the other hand. intragastric infection resulted in abortive or poor virus replication in all tested organs. and poor T cell responses to the virus. especially at late times after infection. Consistent with the T cell kinetics. the MCMV latent load was high in the lungs. but low in the spleen of intranasally infected mice and lowest in all tested organs upon intragastric infection.

In this study. stem samples of potato crops exhibiting blackleg were taken from three farms in Co. Cork. Ireland. and they were found to be infected with P. atrosepticum. Three closely related bacteriophages (phages) that are specific to this phytopathogen were isolated and characterized. namely vB_PatP_CB1. vB_PatP_CB3. and vB_PatP_CB4 (abbreviated as CB1.

Morphology. latent periods. burst sizes. and their stability at various temperatures and pHs were also examined. Genome sequencing of the three phages revealed that they shared a minimum nucleotide identity of 93% with each other. Their genomes exhibited an Enquartavirinae genome organization. possessing several conserved proteins that were associated with phages of this group. like the type species Escherichia virus N4. Tandem electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) allowed for the identification of ten structural proteins that form the virion of CB1. six that are conserved in phage N4.

The binding of the hormonal ligands induces nuclear receptors to assume a configuration that leads to transcriptional activation. Recent studies of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors revealed that. upon ligand binding. a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-containing complex is displaced from the nuclear receptor in exchange for a histone acetyltransferase (HAT)-containing complex.

To date. there is no explanation for the diversity in the clinical manifestations. Primary infection can occur perinatally or later in life. and inevitably results in latent infection. Seropositivity for antibodies against CMV is indicative of latent infection. but is insufficient as a predictor for the risk of recurrence. As a model for this important medical problem. we compared the risks of murine CMV recurrence from latency established after neonatal primary infection and after infection at adult age.

Mice depleted of the CD8+ T-lymphocyte subset eliminated infectious virus with a clearance kinetics similar to that of normal mice.

There was no effect on immediate early (IE) and early (E) gene expression as far as the candidate genes IE1. E1 and those encoding the major DNA-binding protein and the DNA polymerase were concerned. Late gene transcription. assayed by the candidate genes encoding glycoprotein B and the MCMV homologue of ICP 18.5. was blocked and MCMV DNA replication was found to be reduced but not halted. The most prominent finding of the cytokine effect. seen by electron microscopy. was an alteration of nucleocapsid formation.

The most prominent alteration upon lytic murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection is the rapid degradation of the cellular miR-27a and miR-27b. Here. we report that this regulation is mediated by the ∼1.7 kb spliced and highly abundant MCMV m169 transcript. Specificity to miR-27a/b is mediated by a single. apparently optimized. miRNA binding site located in its 3′-UTR.

Expression of the 3′-UTR of m169 by an adenoviral vector was sufficient to mediate its function. indicating that no other viral factors are essential in this process. Degradation of miR-27a/b was found to be accompanied by 3′-tailing and -trimming.

During viral egress. particles containing viral proteins and nucleic acids again move from the site of their synthesis to that of virus assembly and further to the plasma membrane.

Viral particles of neurotropic alphaherpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) show bidirectional transport towards the cell center as well as the periphery. indicating that they utilize microtubule motors of opposing directionality. To understand the mechanisms of specific motor recruitment. it is necessary to characterize the molecular composition of such motile viral structures. We have generated HSV1 capsids with different surface features without impairing their overall architecture. and show that in a mammalian cell-free system the microtubule motors dynein and kinesin-1 and the dynein cofactor dynactin could interact directly with capsids independent of other host factors.

Several independent studies have subsequently shown that membrane proteins of the intracellular mature virus (IMV) insert co-translationally into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. and are targeted to and retained in the IC. the compartment from which the virus acquires its membranes.

VZV presumably acquires its envelope in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). and it has recently been shown that its major envelope glycoprotein. VZV-gE. accumulates in this compartment when expressed alone. In contrast. the envelopment of HSV has been proposed to occur at the inner nuclear membrane. although to which compartment the gE homolog (HSV-gE) is transported is unknown. For this reason. we have studied the intracellular traffic of HSV-gE and have found that this glycoprotein accumulates at steady state in the TGN. both when expressed from cloned cDNA and in HSV-infected cells. In addition.

Aims: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the existing evidence for psychological interventions targeting perfectionism in individuals with psychiatric disorders associated with perfectionism and/or elevated perfectionism. Method: Eight studies were identified and were analysed in meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were carried out for the Personal Standards and Concern over Mistakes subscales of the Frost Multi-Dimensional Perfectionism Scale (FMPS) and the Self Orientated Perfectionism and Socially Prescribed Perfectionism subscales of the Hewitt and Flett MPS (HMPS) in order to investigate change between pre and postintervention.

The relationship of clinical and demographic variables to neuropsychological functioning within the AN group was also explored.   Method The performance of 41 children and adolescents with a diagnosis of AN were compared to 43 healthy control (HC) participants on a number of neuropsychological measures.   Results There were no differences in IQ between AN and HC groups. However. children and adolescents with AN displayed significantly more perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. and lower Style and Central Coherence scores on the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test relative to HCs.

Observational studies in routine clinical practice have shown cognitive improvement in some groups of patients receiving these agents but longitudinal trajectories before and after AChEI initiation have not previously been considered.  Objectives To compare trajectories of cognitive function before and after AChEI initiation and investigate predictors of these differences.  Method A retrospective longitudinal study was constructed using data from 2460 patients who received AChEIs and who had routine data on cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination; MMSE) before and after AChEI initiation. Longitudinal MMSE change was modelled using three-piece linear mixed models with the following segments: 0–12 months prior to AChEI initiation. 0–6 months and 6–36 months after initiation.  Results MMSE decline was reversed (in that the slope was improved by an average 4.2 units per year. 95% CI 3.5–4.8) during the 6-month period following AChEI initiation compared with the slope in the one year period before AChEI initiation. The slope in the period from 6–36 months following AChEI initiation returned to the pre-initiation downward trajectory. The differences in slopes in the 1 year period prior to AChEI initiation and in the 6 months after initiation were smaller among those with higher MMSE scores at the time of AChEI initiation. among those who received a vascular dementia diagnosis at any point. and among those receiving antipsychotic agents.

The function is derived as the expected value of a pixel. given that values are censored at 65 535. the maximum detectable intensity for double precision scanning software. Maximum likelihood estimation based on a Cauchy distribution is used to fit the model. which is able to estimate gene expressions taking account of outliers and the systematic bias caused by signal censoring of highly expressed genes.

Both forms of TGF- beta suppressed both the normal cellular proliferation and colony formation induced by recombinant human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In the presence of GM-CSF or IL-3. optimal concentrations of TGF-beta (400 pmol/L) inhibited colony formation by erythroid (BFU-E). multipotential (CFU-GEMM). and granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitor cells by 90% to 100%. whereas granulocyte or monocyte cluster formation was not inhibited.

Institute of Mathematics,A multiset (mset. for short) is an unordered collection of objects (called the elements) in which. unlike a standard (Cantorian) set. elements are allowed to repeat. In other words. an mset is a set to which elements may belong more than once. and hence it is a non-Cantorian set. In this paper. we endeavour to present an overview of basics of multiset and applications.The term multiset. as Knuth ([46]. p. 36) notes. was first suggested by NG de Bruijn in a private communication to him. Owing to its aptness. it has replaced a variety of terms. viz. list. heap. bunch. bag. sample. weighted set. occurrence set. and fireset (finitely repeated element set) used in different contexts but conveying synonimity with mset. As mentioned earlier. elements are allowed to repeat in an mset (finitely in most of the known application areas. albeit in a theoretical development infinite multiplicities of elements are also dealt with (see [1 1].[37].[5 1].[72] and [30]. in particular).,True,NLLkyOgAAAAJ:iHNVki4A1WcC,206,https://eudml.org/serve/226431/accessibleLayeredPdf/0,3372035161869270465,/scholar?cites=3372035161869270465,,https://eudml.org/serve/226431/accessibleLayeredPdf/0,0,0,0

The emission of both the light particles (LP). with A≤ 4. Z≤ 2. as well as the complex intermediate mass fragments (IMF). with 4< A< 20. Z> 2. is considered as the dynamical collective mass motion of preformed clusters through the barrier.

Although recent studies have demonstrated a clear association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with multiple sclerosis (Zaadstra et al.. 2008; Lunemann and Munz. 2009; Salvetti et al.. 2009). there has been much debate if and where the virus acts in the pathogenic cascade of multiple sclerosis and whether the virus needs to gain entry to the central nervous system (CNS). A recent study reported in Brain by Willis et al.(2009) showed that there is little evidence for the presence of EBV in the central nervous system of people with multiple sclerosis.

Key events in HSK involve the interaction between cornea-infiltrating inflammatory cells and resident cells. This interaction. in which macrophages. producing IL-1 and TNF-α. and IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells play a crucial role. results in the local secretion of immune-modulatory factors and a major influx of neutrophils causing corneal lesions and blindness. The Th1-derived cytokine IL-17 has been shown to play an important role in several inflammatory diseases characterized by a massive infiltration of neutrophils into inflamed tissue. Here we show that IL-17 is expressed in corneas from patients with HSK and that the IL-17R is constitutively expressed by human corneal fibroblasts (HCF).

HSV-1 proteins are expressed in a temporally coordinated fashion during lytic infection. but their expression pattern during latent infection is largely unknown. Selective retention of HSV-1 reactive T-cells in human TG suggests their role in controlling reactivation by recognizing locally expressed HSV-1 proteins. We characterized the HSV-1 proteins recognized by virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cells recovered from human HSV-1–infected TG. T-cell clusters. consisting of both CD4 and CD8 T-cells. surrounded neurons and expressed mRNAs and proteins consistent with in situ antigen recognition and antiviral function.

We now demonstrate that IFN-and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) display synergism in their antiviral activity. As little as 2 ng/ml of IFN-and TNF-reduced the virus yield by about three orders of magnitude. There was no effect on immediate early (IE) and early (E) gene expression as far as the candidate genes IE1. E1 and those encoding the major DNA-binding protein and the DNA polymerase were concerned. Late gene transcription. assayed by the candidate genes encoding glycoprotein B and the MCMV homologue of ICP 18.5. was blocked and MCMV DNA replication was found to be reduced but not halted. The most prominent finding of the cytokine effect. seen by electron microscopy. was an alteration of nucleocapsid formation. Altogether. the synergism is multifaceted and acts at more than one stage during viral morphogenesis.

The  other 21 genes encode tRNAs with up to five mismatches in these stems.  and some of these overlap extensively with the downstream genes.  Because a well-paired acceptor stem is required for proper tRNA  functioning. RNA editing in the products of these genes was suspected.  We investigated this hypothesis by studying cDNA sequences from eight  tRNAs and found the editing of up to 5 nt at their 3′ ends. This  editing appears to occur by a novel mechanism with the 5′ end of the  acceptor stem being used as a template for the de novo  synthesis of the 3′ end. presumably by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Species within Cnidaria have life cycles that involve one or both of the two distinct body forms. a typically benthic polyp. which may or may not be colonial. and a typically pelagic mostly solitary medusa. The currently accepted taxonomic scheme subdivides Cnidaria into two main assemblages: Anthozoa (Hexacorallia + Octocorallia) – cnidarians with a reproductive polyp and the absence of a medusa stage – and Medusozoa (Cubozoa. Hydrozoa. Scyphozoa. Staurozoa) – cnidarians that usually possess a reproductive medusa stage. Hypothesized relationships among these taxa greatly impact interpretations of cnidarian character evolution. We expanded the sampling of cnidarian mitochondrial genomes. particularly from Medusozoa. to reevaluate phylogenetic relationships within Cnidaria. Our phylogenetic analyses based on a mitochogenomic dataset support many prior hypotheses. including monophyly of Hexacorallia. Octocorallia. Medusozoa. Cubozoa. Staurozoa. Hydrozoa. Carybdeida.

Demosponges. the largest class in the phylum Porifera. underwent only the first of these transitions and their mitochondrial genomes display a peculiar combination of ancestral and animal-specific features. To get an insight into the evolution of mitochondrial genomes within the Demospongiae. we determined 17 new mtDNA sequences from this group and analyzing them with five previously published sequences. Our analysis revealed that all demosponge mtDNAs are 16- to 25-kbp circular molecules. containing 13–15 protein genes. 2 rRNA genes. and 2–27 tRNA genes.

It contains <100 described species of exclusively marine sponges that have been traditionally subdivided into 7 genera based on morphological characters. Because some of the morphological features of the homoscleromorphs are shared with eumetazoans and are absent in other sponges. the phylogenetic position of the group has been investigated in several recent studies. However. the phylogenetic relationships within the group remain unexplored by modern methods.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we describe the first molecular phylogeny of Homoscleromorpha based on nuclear (18S and 28S rDNA) and complete mitochondrial DNA sequence data that focuses on inter-generic relationships. Our results revealed two robust clades within this group. one containing the spiculate species (genera Plakina. Plakortis. Plakinastrella and Corticium) and the other containing aspiculate species (genera Oscarella and Pseudocorticium). thus rejecting a close relationship between Pseudocorticium and Corticium. Among the spiculate species. we found affinities between the Plakortis and Plakinastrella genera. and between the Plakina and Corticium.

O. carmela mtDNA is 20.327 bp and contains the largest complement of genes reported for animal mtDNA. including a putative gene for the C subunit of the twin-arginine translocase (tatC) that has never been found in animal mtDNA.

We have tested these models by characterizing unc-18 mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the absence of UNC-18. the size of the readily releasable pool is severely reduced. Our results show that the near absence of fusion-competent vesicles is not caused by a reduction in syntaxin levels. by a mislocalization of syntaxin. by a defect in fusion or by a failure to open syntaxin during priming.

Our data indicate that this cycle is regulated by periodic calcium release mediated by the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3 receptor). Mutations in the IP3 receptor slow down or eliminate the cycle. while overexpression speeds up the cycle. The IP3 receptor controls these periodic muscle contractions nonautonomously from the intestine. In the intestinal cells. calcium levels oscillate with the same period as the defecation cycle and peak calcium levels immediately precede the first muscle contraction.

The antifoulant and environmental pollutant tributyltin (TBT). which causes imposex in gastropod snails. induces an “obesogenic” phenotype in mammals. through the activation of the nuclear receptors retinoid X receptor (RXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). In teleosts. the effects of TBT on the lipid metabolism are poorly understood. particularly following exposure to low. environmental concentrations. In this context. the present work shows that exposure of zebrafish to 10 and 50 ng/L of TBT (as Sn) from pre-hatch to 9 months of age alters the body weight. condition factor. hepatosomatic index and hepatic triglycerides in a gender and dose related manner. Furthermore. TBT modulated the transcription of key lipid regulating factors and enzymes involved in adipogenesis. lipogenesis. glucocorticoid metabolism. growth and development in the brain and liver of exposed fish. revealing sexual dimorphic effects in the latter. Overall. the present study shows that the model mammalian obesogen TBT interferes with triglyceride accumulation and the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in zebrafish and indentifies the brain lipogenic transcription profile of fish as a new target of this compound.,True,PEsFtWEAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,64,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143911,17832951096633981488,/scholar?cites=17832951096633981488,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143911,0,0,0

Structures exhibited by these compounds go from acyclic entities with a linear chain to complex polycyclic molecules. Their medical and pharmaceutical application has been investigated for a few decades. however other properties. such as antifouling. are not to be discarded. Many compounds were discovered in the last years. although the need for new drugs keeps this field open as many algal species are poorly screened. The ecological role of marine algal halogenated metabolites has somehow been overlooked. This new research field will provide valuable and novel insight into the marine ecosystem dynamics as well as a new approach to comprehending biodiversity. Furthermore. understanding interactions between halogenated compound production by algae and the environment. including anthropogenic or global climate changes. is a challenging target for the coming years. Research of halogenated metabolites has been more focused on macroalgae than on phytoplankton. However. phytoplankton could be a very promising material since it is the base of the marine food chain with quick adaptation to environmental changes. which undoubtedly has consequences on secondary metabolism. This paper reviews recent progress on this field and presents trends on the role of marine algae as producers of halogenated compounds.

The concretions comprise 4% (DW) of the sediment and contain 11.7 ± 1.6% iron compared to 4.9 ± 0.3% iron in the sediment in which they are found. They are formed by the precipitation of iron oxides in the pores between the sediment grains; this has filled about one‐sixth of the originally available pore space. To produce the concretions. the plants have extracted 0.25% Fe from the anoxic bulk sediment and concentrated it into the oxidized microenvironment surrounding each root.

1191612,Distribution of monomethylmercury and mercury in surface sediments of the Tagus Estuary (Portugal),2005,J Canário and C Vale and M Caetano,50,Marine pollution bulletin,10,1142-1145,,Mercury is a global pollutant that cycles between air. water. sediment. soil and organisms (Moreno et al.. 2005). Although anthropogenic Hg emissions have been reduced by half in the last decades (Pacyna et al.. 2001). ongoing contamination is still a worldwide problem. Depending on the Hg discharge and the ecosystem dynamics. Hg in sediments may be present in concentrated hotspots or dispersed over large areas (Hinton and Veiga. 2001; Moreno et al.. 2005). The conversion of inorganic Hg into monomethylmercury (MMHg). a strong neurotoxin. is a critical step in its pathway and toxicity. The MMHg concentrations result from the balance between methylation and demethylation processes. which are not completely understood (Mason and Benoit. 2003). The most important factors influencing biological methylation are the availability of inorganic mercury and the nature of the microbial community (Mauro et al.. 1999). although other influences include physical and chemical parameters such as temperature. pH. salinity. organic carbon and redox potential (Gilmour and Henry. 1991; Barkay et al.. 1997; Mason and Benoit. 2003). Despite the paucity of information concerning sources. in situ production. biogeochemistry and bioaccumulation of MMHg in marine organisms. sediments appear as potentially significant sources to food webs in the coastal zone (Covelli et al.. 1999; Gill et al.. 1999; Mason et al.. 1999; Langer et al.. 2001; Hammerschmidt et al.. 2004) and possibly to the open ocean via hydrological or biological transport.

Endogenous synthesis of ARA. EPA and DHA occurs from precursor dietary essential fatty acids such as linoleic and α-linolenic acid through elongation and Δ5 and Δ6 desaturations. With respect to desaturation activities some noteworthy differences have been noted in vertebrate classes. In mammals. the Δ5 activity is allocated to the Fads1 gene. while Fads2 is a Δ6 desaturase. In contrast. teleosts show distinct combinations of desaturase activities (e.g. bifunctional or separate Δ5 and Δ6 desaturases) apparently allocated to Fads2-type genes. To determine the timing of Fads1-Δ5 and Fads2-Δ6 evolution in vertebrates we used a combination of comparative and functional genomics with the analysis of key phylogenetic species. Our data show that Fads1 and Fads2 genes with Δ5 and Δ6 activities respectively. evolved before gnathostome radiation. since the catshark Scyliorhinus canicula has functional orthologues of both gene families. Consequently. the loss of Fads1 in teleosts is a secondary episode. while the existence of Δ5 activities in the same group most likely occurred through independent mutations into Fads2 type genes. Unexpectedly. we also establish that events of Fads1 gene expansion have taken place in birds and reptiles.

They catalyze the desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates at the delta-9 position. generating essential components of phospholipids. triglycerides. cholesterol esters and wax esters. Despite being crucial for interpreting SCDs roles across species. the evolutionary history of the SCD gene family in vertebrates has yet to be elucidated. in particular their isoform diversity. origin and function. This work aims to contribute to this fundamental effort. We show here. through comparative genomics and phylogenetics that the SCD gene family underwent an unexpectedly complex history of duplication and loss events. Paralogy analysis hints that SCD1 and SCD5 genes emerged as part of the whole genome duplications (2R) that occurred at the stem of the vertebrate lineage. The SCD1 gene family expanded in rodents with the parallel loss of SCD5 in the Muridae family. The SCD1 gene expansion is also observed in the Lagomorpha although without the SCD5 loss. In the amphibian Xenopus tropicalis we find a single SCD1 gene but not SCD5. though this could be due to genome incompleteness. In the analysed teleost species no SCD5 is found. while the surrounding SCD5-less locus is conserved in comparison to tetrapods. In addition. the teleost SCD1 gene repertoire expanded to two copies as a result of the teleost specific genome duplication (3R).

The antifoulant and environmental pollutant tributyltin (TBT). which causes imposex in gastropod snails. induces an “obesogenic” phenotype in mammals. through the activation of the nuclear receptors retinoid X receptor (RXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). In teleosts. the effects of TBT on the lipid metabolism are poorly understood. particularly following exposure to low. environmental concentrations. In this context. the present work shows that exposure of zebrafish to 10 and 50 ng/L of TBT (as Sn) from pre-hatch to 9 months of age alters the body weight. condition factor. hepatosomatic index and hepatic triglycerides in a gender and dose related manner. Furthermore. TBT modulated the transcription of key lipid regulating factors and enzymes involved in adipogenesis. lipogenesis. glucocorticoid metabolism. growth and development in the brain and liver of exposed fish. revealing sexual dimorphic effects in the latter. Overall. the present study shows that the model mammalian obesogen TBT interferes with triglyceride accumulation and the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in zebrafish and indentifies the brain lipogenic transcription profile of fish as a new target of this compound.,True,LKKSM1wAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C,64,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143911,17832951096633981488,/scholar?cites=17832951096633981488,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143911,0,0,0

Evolutionarily. most homeobox genes fall into two related clades: the ANTP and the PRD classes. Some genes in ANTP class. notably Hox.

To investigate the evolutionary history of these gene clusters. we examined homeobox gene chromosomal locations in the cephalochordate amphioxus. Branchiostoma floridae. We deduce that 22 amphioxus ANTP class homeobox genes localize in just three chromosomes. One contains the Hox cluster plus AmphiEn. AmphiMnx. and AmphiDll.

Hypocholesterolaemic drugs such as statins are among the most prescribed human pharmaceuticals in western European countries. In vertebrates. this therapeutic class disrupts the cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR). responsible for the limiting step in the mevalonate pathway. Recently. functional studies have shown that statins competitively inhibit HMGR in vertebrates and arthropods. two taxa that have diverged over 450 million years ago. Importantly. chronic simvastatin exposure disrupts crustacean reproduction and development at environmentally relevant concentrations. Hence. a fundamental question emerges: what is the taxonomic scope of statins-induced HMGR inhibition across metazoans?

To test the sensitivity and feasibility of the AGE technique. X-ray assays were performed with naked DNA and with live amphipods. These positive controls demonstrated the effectiveness of the AGE technique to not only discriminate distinct levels of DNA strand breakage in a dose-dependent manner. but also to identify and quantify the type of strand breakage induced. It was also shown that it is possible to detect DNA damage using whole-body DNA extracts from amphipods. To explore the potential of this technique for use in ecotoxicological studies with amphipods. a 96-h waterborne-copper toxicity test was performed.

Measurements of copper (Cu) body-burden and metallothionein (MT) induction were integrated with organism and population level endpoints to provide evidence for cause-effect of Cu contamination. The most relevant sub-lethal effects detected in this study were the stimulation of growth and reproduction at the highest treatment (4.9 mgCu/kg dry wt.). Bioaccumulation of Cu (95 µgCu/g dry wt.) and higher (p< 0.001) synthesis of MT (1.7 mg/g dry wt.) were seen in males from that treatment compared to control. suggesting that the observed effects were associated with Cu contamination. Although the effects of Cu were evident both on growth and reproduction. the results of the reproductive output. namely higher offspring production is regarded as a direct consequence of faster growth rates. As an interpretation for this unexpected condition improvement. induced by Cu contamination. it is suggested the phenomenon termed hormesis. Like in the current study. hormesis effects have been linked in other studies with induction of MT and/or increased growth and reproduction. Attention is called to the fact that some of the unexpected response patterns observed in chronic toxicity testing may be related with hormesis-type events.

As a positive control. tributyltin (50 ng TBT Sn/L) clearly induced imposex and led to a significant increase in the severity of the phenomenon. In contrast. although a selective P450 aromatase inhibitor (formestane at 0.3 mg/L) was capable of imposex induction. it failed to increase its severity. A vertebrate androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (cyproterone acetate at 1.25 mg/L) in combination with TBT completely blocked the imposex induction capacity of TBT.

A current evolutionary hypothesis suggests that CYP19 gene arose at the origin of vertebrates. given that it has not been found outside this clade. The human CYP19 gene is located in one of the proposed MHC-paralogon regions (HSA15q). At present it is unclear whether this genomic location is ancestral (which would suggest an invertebrate origin for CYP19) or derived (genomic location with no evolutionary meaning). The distinction between these possibilities should help to clarify the timing of the CYP19 emergence and which taxa should be investigated.

The clinical picture is characterized by i.a. episodes of fever. the cause of which also remains speculative. Previous studies of bacterial isolates in the liver or bile ducts in primary sclerosing cholangitis have had the shortcoming of possible contamination associated with the sampling. The aim of this study was to investigate whether bile and bile duct tissue. obtained under sterile conditions in connection with liver transplantation. contain bacteria.Methods: We studied bile from bile duct walls and bile collected from the explanted livers of 36 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and 14 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.Results: Positive cultures were obtained from 21 of 36 primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. but from none of the primary biliary cirrhosis patients.

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are liver-resident mesenchymal cells involved in essential processes in the liver. However. knowledge concerning these cells in human livers is limited because of the lack of a simple isolation method. Methods. We isolated fetal and adult human liver cells by immunomagnetic beads coated with antibodies to a mesenchymal stromal cell marker (CD271) to enrich a population of HSCs. The cells were characterized by cell cultivation. immunocytochemistry. flow cytometry. reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Cells were injected into nude mice after partial hepatectomy to study in vivo localization of the cells. Results. In vitro. CD271þ cells were lipid-containing cells expressing several HSC markers: the glial fibrillary acidic protein. desmin. vimentin and a-smooth muscle actin but negative for CK8. albumin and hepatocyte antigen. The cells produced several inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6. IL-1A. IL-1B and IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-3 and inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.

The mucus layers are a complex matrix of molecules. and mucus swelling. hydration and permeability are affected by many factors. including ion composition. Here. we used the C. rodentium model to investigate mucus dynamics during infection. By measuring the mucus layer thickness in tissue explants during infection. we demonstrated that the thickness changes dynamically during the course of infection and that its thickest stage coincides with the start of a decrease of bacterial density at day 14 after infection. Although quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that mucin mRNA increases during early infection. the increased mucus layer thickness late in infection was not explained by increased mRNA levels. Proteomic analysis of mucus did not demonstrate the appearance of additional mucins. but revealed an increased number of proteins involved in defense responses. Ussing chamber-based electrical measurements demonstrated that ion secretion was dynamically altered during the infection phases. Furthermore. the bicarbonate ion channel Bestrophin-2 mRNA nominally increased. whereas the Cftr mRNA decreased during the late infection clearance phase. Microscopy of Muc2 immunostained tissues suggested that the inner striated mucus layer present in the healthy colon was scarce during the time point of most severe infection (10 days post infection). but then expanded. albeit with a less structured appearance. during the expulsion phase.

Present evidence suggests continental biotas have had a long. complex history asjudged by patterns of relationship among areas of endemism. Thus. an analysis of speciescladograms.in which component taxa share areas of endemism. reveals. first. that more thanone general area-cladogram typically exists for the areas of a continental biota. and second. thatthere is often incongruence among these general area-cladograms. Under the vicariance hypothesisthat general area-cladograms describe real historical patterns for components of thebiota. such incongruence implies that the biota has been subjected to a number of processes thatcan produce highly complex histories among areas of endemism. including area …,True,doUOYYQAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,202,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/37/3/221/1668008,16838751473222881475,/scholar?cites=16838751473222881475,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1022.9061&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

With 1717 characters (distributions of species and subspecies) we find a single most parsimonious tree of area‐relationships. This topology does not match area‐relationships determined from phylogenetic studies of morphologic characters in some Neotropical birds. Analyses of data partitions representing major taxonomic subdivisions within Passerine birds provide many different hypotheses of area‐relationships.

1191909,Species concepts and the ontology of evolution,1987,Joel Cracraft,2,Biology and philosophy,3,329-346,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Biologists and philosophers have long recognized the importance of species. yet species concepts serve two masters. evolutionary theory on the one hand and taxonomy on the other. Much of present-day evolutionary and systematic biology has confounded these two roles primarily through use of the biological species concept. Theories require entities that are real. discrete. irreducible. and comparable. Within the neo-Darwinian synthesis. however. biological species have been treated as real or subjectively delimited entities. discrete or nondiscrete. and they are often capable of being decomposed into other. smaller units. Because of this. biological species are generally not comparable across different groups of organisms. which implies that the ontological structure of evolutionary theory requires modification.

Phylogenetic relationships within seven lineages of birds were analyzed by numerical cladistic techniques applied to data sets of morphological characters. These relationships revealed extensive congruence among the spatial and temporal histories of lineages whose species are endemic to common areas of endemism. A general hypothesis is constructed to explain this congruence in which widespread biotas are postulated to have been partitioned into areas of endemism by the origin of geomorphological and/or ecological‐climatic barriers.Congruence in these phylogenetic patterns of differentiation suggests the following historical pattern of interrelationships for areas of endemism along the northern and eastern coasts of Australia: (Kimberley Plateau …,True,doUOYYQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,178,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1986.tb00566.x,13820308231774562516,/scholar?cites=13820308231774562516,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1986.tb00566.x,0,0,0

A hypothesized cause is a greater vulnerability of female turtles to road mortality. We evaluated this hypothesis by comparing sex ratios from published and unpublished population surveys of turtles conducted on‐ versus off‐roads. Among 38 166 turtles from 157 studies reporting sex ratios. we found a consistently larger female fraction in samples from on‐roads (61%) than off‐roads (41%). We conclude that female turtles are indeed more likely to cross roadways than are males. which may explain recently reported skewed sex ratios near roadways and signify eventual population declines as females are differentially eliminated.,True,0ePGCP8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,255,https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2006.00032.x,1147429242354402733,/scholar?cites=1147429242354402733,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30767086/PW_11-103_Norfolk_Ecopassage_EA_Appendix_Part_G.pdf,0,0,0

Thus. selection that changes the mean value of one trait causes other traits to change as well. Recent comparative studies have emphasized the possible importance of such correlated responses in affecting the evolution of traits. including some behaviors. which are of little adaptive significance. or even maladaptive. However. it is also possible for traits with major effects on fitness. such as brain size. to evolve entirely by correlated response. Other traits that do not appear to have evolved at all may have been subject to much directional selection. simply to prevent their evolution by correlated response. The new interest in correlated responses reflects more rigorous attempts to consider the organism as a whole. rather than dissecting it into a number of questionably separable traits.,True,0ePGCP8AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,187,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169534792902295,10108907924168810816,/scholar?cites=10108907924168810816,,,0,0,0

Thus. there is a need to accurately and efficiently identify hotspots of road‐mortality for hazard assessment and mitigation. In 2002. we conducted walking and driving surveys throughout an extensive rural highway network in northern New York. USA. to evaluate survey methods and to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of herpetofauna road‐mortality. In 2004. we repeated the surveys at a subset of locations to quantify interannual repeatability.

We investigated the spatial patterns of inter-colony aggression within and between two Pheidole species of seed-harvesting ants in the Mojave Desert of California by quantifying aggression between colonies in standardized staged encounters. We also tested whether the level of fighting between workers of two colonies is affected by previous exposure to each other. We show that neighbors (i.e.. colonies less that 2.6 m away) of either species are treated less aggressively than more distant colonies and that habituation may be a mechanism by which this discrimination is achieved.

I compared the duration of  parental care between cooperatively and noncooperatively breeding species  using phylogenetically independent contrasts and matched pairs. The incubation  and nestling periods did not differ between the two parental care systems. but  the duration of postfledging offspring care was significantly longer in  species that regularly breed cooperatively.

Members of territorial groups forage together and may gain information about how to acquire food by observing each other. A field experiment was performed to determine whether a novel skill. door opening to gain access to food. was more rapidly acquired by members of groups in which a trained individual performed the skill. A higher proportion of jays in groups with behavioural ‘models’ (trained birds that opened doors in the presence of group members) acquired the door‐opening skill than those groups without models.

The ontogeny of foraging and breeding behaviour was followed in a cohort of cooperatively breeding white-throated magpie-jays from fledging through to dispersal. Young jays approached adult levels of foraging proficiency within 1 year of fledging. During their first year of age. young jays provisioned nests as helpers at a lower rate than did older individuals. No improvement occurred during that first year. however. suggesting that lower provisioning was the result of other factors than the lack of foraging or nesting skills.

The White‐throated Magpie‐jay Calocitta formosa is unusual among birds in that females are philopatric and jointly defend permanent resource territories while males disperse before they are 2 years of age. One female in a group is the primary breeder. One male joins the group permanently as her mate. Males that do not have a permanent breeding position circulate among groups and attempt to mate with both the primary breeding female and other group females.

Begging by reproductive female white-throated magpie-jays,2009,Jesse MS Ellis and Tom A Langen and Elena C Berg,78,Animal behaviour,3,615-623,Academic Press,Food begging is common in nutritionally dependent young of many animals. but structurally homologous calls recur in adult signal repertoires of many species. We propose eight functional hypotheses for begging in adults; these stem from observations in birds but apply broadly to other taxa in which begging occurs. Adult cooperatively breeding white-throated magpie-jays. Calocitta formosa. use loud begging vocalizations. particularly near the nest site during reproduction. We analysed the social context and behavioural phenology of loud calling and allofeeding in this species and compared these with predictions from each functional hypothesis. We found that reproductive females were the primary producers of beg calls. and their begging peaked during the fertile period when reproductive conflict among males and females was highest.

1191953,Who’s at the gap between research and implementation?: The places and spaces of encounter between scientists and local people in Madidi. Bolivia,2015,Anne Helen Toomey,,,,,,Increasing attention in the conservation sciences is being paid to the existence of a ‘gap’ between research and action. Although much research has implications for management. rarely does it have real impact on the problems it seeks to address. As a result researchers are increasingly concerned with demonstrating that the impacts of their research go beyond academia. Recent scholarship has proposed various solutions for ‘bridging the gap’. However. missing from the debate is a closer analysis of who lies within the gap and what happens in that place: What kinds of encounters and misencounters occur between scientists and non-scientists during the practice of doing scientific research. especially in situations that include ‘everyday’ activities and communication (i.e. fieldwork)? This thesis approaches the issue by enacting a Participatory Action Research methodology in the Amazonian region of Madidi National Park in Bolivia. that includes a quantitative analysis of past research. semi-structured and unstructured interviews (n = 137). and workshops and focus groups (n = 12) with local inhabitants. scientists and park guards. The study demonstrates the significance of currently unacknowledged or undervalued components of the research-action gap. such as power. respect and recognition. It explains how and why within spaces of encounter and misencounter between scientists and local people. knowledge can be exchanged or hidden away. worldviews can be expanded or further entrenched. and scientific research can be welcomed or rejected.

One issue that is gaining increasing attention in urban and suburban settings is humanwildlife conflicts (Soulsbury and White 2015). Traditionally a subject of rural study. where key concerns dealt with carnivores preying on livestock. human-wildlife conflicts have recently been attracting interest in cities as mid-sized carnivores. such as coyotes. move into urban areas (Grimm et al. 2008; Soulsbury and White 2015).Coyotes have proven to be extremely adaptable and able to live in diverse landscapes. including urban environments. and are found in almost all major cities in the United States. including Chicago (Morey et al. 2007).

These canids have been described as resilient. undermining attempts to extirpate them from neighborhoods and other areas of high human density where conflicts arise (Sterling et al. 1983; Gese and Beckoff 2004). As opportunistic predators. coyotes have been known to prey upon domestic pets. angering pet-owners and others who feel that sharing the landscape is an inconvenience. injustice. and security risk. As such. coyotes can prompt fear or even hatred amongst many communities (Shivik 2014; Weckel and Wincorn 2016).

Public participation in scientific research (hereby referred to as citizen science) is often touted as a way to help people get to know. connect with. and care for an ecological place. But there is a lack of empirical evidence about if and how this works. This paper explores how citizen science can connect people more closely with place. create new understandings of what those places mean. and encourage people to participate more fully in being stewards of those places.

Why spend years studying an endangered species if resulting knowledge will not help to save it? In response to this problem. conservation scientists in developing countries increasingly seek to engage with local communities through collaborative methods in the collection of scientific data. such as ‘participatory monitoring’or ‘citizen science’. Such methodologies are increasingly utilized for scientific research and community-based conservation. allowing for research that would normally be cost-prohibitive. promoting environmental awareness. and having the potential to empower and engage local people in conservation actions. In settings where traditional communities still live closely connected to the land. participatory science can additionally serve as an alternative to conventional scientific knowledge and postcolonial conservation strategies. offering promise as a source of social-ecological resilience. However. participation is not a guarantee for empowerment. and these attempts towards the co-production of knowledge often neglect to take into account the specific cultural and social histories that are a large part of what motivate people to participate in the first place. This presentation will explore the potential of such participatory research methodologies to bridge the research-implementation gap by taking the case of Madidi National Park. Bolivia. one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. which is overlapped by lowland indigenous territories that cover approximately one-third of the park’s area.

1191980,An Introduction to the Ecological and Political Context of Biodiversity Conservation in Madagascar,,Georgina Cullman and Domoina Rakotobe,,,,,,Madagascar is iconic in international conservation circles because of its unique and threatened wildlife. Madagascar is larger than France and is sometimes referred to as the eighth continent because of its size and the thirteen diverse ecosystems it supports (de Wit 2003; CEPF 2014). Running like a spine down the island’s eastern side are Madagascar’s rainforests. which cover about 18.41% of the land area (CEPF 2014); a mosaic of grasslands and woodlands covers the central 41% of the island (CEPF 2014); the Southern tip is arid (300–600 mm of precipitation per year) and is home to the unique spiny forest (Grubb 2003). Other important ecosystems include the dry forests of the west of the country. Because of its geological history (it has been isolated from other land forms for at least 80 million years). a large proportion of Madagascar’s biodiversity is endemic. found nowhere else on earth. Most of Madagascar’s endemic taxa are also phylogenetically distinct. meaning they have no living close relatives elsewhere on the planet (Ganzhorn et al. 2013). The island harbors over 11.200 indigenous plants (90% endemic). 406 species of reptiles (96% endemic) and 295 amphibians (nearly 100% endemic)(CEPF 2014). Of course the most well–known of Madagascar’s endemic species are the lemurs—a morphologically and ecologically diverse primate group composed of 5 families. 15 genera and 101 species at last count (IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group 2014; Mittermeier et al. 2013).The people and cultures of Madagascar are also unique.

Daphnia and other important pelagic consumers of phytoplankton undergo diel horizontal migration (DHM) into macrophytes or other structures in the littoral zone. Some authors have suggested that DHM reduces predation by fishes on Daphnia and other cladocerans. resulting in a lower phytoplankton biomass in shallow lakes than would occur without DHM. The costs and benefits of DHM. and its potential implications in biomanipulation. are relatively unknown. however.2. In this review. we compare studies on diel vertical migration (DVM) to assess factors potentially influencing DHM (e.g. predators. food. light. temperature. dissolved oxygen. pH).

Compared to terrestrial invaders. aquatic species often thrive undetected under water and do not garner notice until too late for early action. However. fortunately for managers. apple snails (Family Ampullariidae. Genus Pomacea) provide their own conspicuous sign of invasion in the form of vibrantly colored egg clutches. Managers can potentially use egg clutches laid in the riparian zone as a means of early detection and species identification. To facilitate such efforts. we quantified differences in characteristics (length. width. depth. mass. egg number) of field-laid clutches for the two most common invasive species of apple snail. P. canaliculata and P. maculata. in native and non-native populations. Pomacea canaliculata native and non-native populations differed noticeably only in width.

A recent morphological analysis of skeletal specimens from this population has shown that they are sufficiently distinct from other western gorillas to justify being classified as the subspecies Gorilla gorilla diehli. a taxonomic name originally applied to them in the early twentieth century (Sarmiento and Oates. 2000). Just as the distinctiveness of the Cross River gorillas is being appreciated. their continued survival is in jeopardy.

Bioko Island. Equatorial Guinea is a small island with large tracts of intact forest that support sizeable populations of commercially valuable vertebrates. especially endemic primates. The island also has a low human population and has experienced dramatic economic growth and rapid development since the mid-1990’s. From October 1997 – September 2010. we monitored the largest bushmeat market on Bioko in Malabo. recording over 197.000 carcasses for sale. We used these data to analyze the dynamics of the market in relation to political events. environmental legislation. and rapid economic growth.

1192025,Boots on the ground: the role of passive acoustic monitoring in evaluating anti-poaching patrols,2020,Christos Astaras and Joshua M Linder and Peter Wrege and Robinson Orume and Paul J Johnson and David W Macdonald,,Environmental Conservation,,,Cambridge University Press,Passive acoustic monitoring is rapidly gaining recognition as a practical. affordable and robust tool for measuring gun hunting levels within protected areas. and consequently for its potential to evaluate anti-poaching patrols’ effectiveness based on outcome (ie. change in hunting pressure) rather than effort (eg. kilometres patrolled) or output (eg. arrests). However. there has been no report to date of a protected area successfully using an acoustic grid to explore baseline levels of gun hunting activity. adapting its patrols in response to the evidence extracted from the acoustic data and then evaluating the effectiveness of the new patrol strategy. We report here such a case in Cameroon’s Korup National Park. where anti-poaching patrol effort was markedly increased in the 2015–2016 Christmas/New Year holiday season to curb the annual peak in gunshots recorded by a 12-sensor acoustic grid in the same period during the previous 2 years. Despite a three-to five-fold increase in patrol days. distance and area covered. the desired outcome–lower gun hunting activity–was not achieved under the new patrol scheme. The findings emphasize the need for adaptive wildlife law enforcement and how passive acoustic monitoring can help attain this goal. and they warn about the risks of using effort-based metrics of anti-poaching strategies as a surrogate for desired outcomes.

Landscape transformation is driven not only by national policies and markets. but also by global market dynamics associated with an increased role for transnational traders and investors. National and global trends affect a disparate number of social. political and economic interactions taking place at the local level. which ultimately shapes land-use and socio-economic change. This paper reviews five different trajectories of landscape change in tropical Latin America. and discusses their implications for development and conservation:(1) Market-driven growth of agribusiness;(2) expansion and modernization of traditional cattle ranching;(3) slow growth of peasant agriculture;(4) logging in production forest frontiers; and (5) resurgence of agro-extractive economies. Contrasting trade-offs between economic development and forest conservation emerge across these landscapes. calling for nuanced policy responses to manage them in the context of climate change. This discussion sets the background to assess how reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and enhancing carbon stocks (REDD+) aims should be better aligned with current landscape trajectories and associated actors to better address climate-change mitigation in forest landscapes with effective and equitable outcomes.

Prior research has primarily focused on the CCFP’s rural welfare impacts. with few studies on program-induced environmental improvements. particularly at the household level. In this study. data from a 2010 survey covering 2808 rural households from across China was analyzed using an interval regression model to explain household-reported survival rates of trees planted on program-enrolled cropland. In addition to household-level factors. we explore the influence of local conditions and institutional configurations by exploiting the wide diversity of contexts covered by the data set. We find that households with more available labor and more forestry experience manage trees better. but that higher opportunity costs for both land and labor have the opposite effect. We also find that the local implementation regime-eg. the degree of prior consultation with participants and regular monitoring-has a strong positive effect on reported survivorship. We suggest that the level of subsidy support to participating households will be key to survivorship of trees in planted CCFP forests for some time to come.

1192046,Upside-down: Global forestry politics reverses directions of ownership in Peru-China timber commodity chains,2009,Louis Putzel,,XIII World Forestry Congress,,,,In the context of globalized trade. the impact of international markets for timber on tropical forests is a major concern. Over the past 5 years. exports of timber from Peruvian Amazonia have grown 180%. With shifts in global commodity chains increasingly relocating production systems to China. the potential impact of that country’s timber transformation industry on Amazonian forests is great. Meanwhile. a major factor affecting trade is the globalization of forest policy through intervention by international institutions and bilateral trade arrangements. Peru. which encompasses over 12% of the total area of Amazonia. is susceptible to both the economic pressures of the forest trade and the political influence of institutions with a mission to regulate that trade and protect forests. Field observations support previous findings that these reforms do not adequately govern the logging industry and raise questions about the equitable distribution of its benefits. Using data collected from timber industry actors in Peru. this study describes the structure of Chinese timber supply chains in the Amazonian region and finds that control is shifting towards China as corporations adapt to new trade norms. Now that China has reached a bilateral free trade agreement with Peru that includes promises to look into these issues. a reexamination of China’s reliance on prevalent global mechanisms of control and verification of timber imports would potentially be useful.,True,8RH7cKoAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,23,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louis_Putzel/publication/228632123_Upside-down_Global_forestry_politics_reverses_directions_of_ownership_in_Peru-China_timber_commodity_chains/links/0c960531c5ac9c283e000000/Upside-down-Global-forestry-politics-reverses-directions-of-ownership-in-Peru-China-timber-commodity-chains.pdf,13070363737517274528,/scholar?cites=13070363737517274528,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Louis_Putzel/publication/228632123_Upside-down_Global_forestry_politics_reverses_directions_of_ownership_in_Peru-China_timber_commodity_chains/links/0c960531c5ac9c283e000000/Upside-down-Global-forestry-politics-reverses-directions-of-ownership-in-Peru-China-timber-commodity-chains.pdf,0,0,0
1192047,Ecosystem services certification: Opportunities and constraints,2011,Erik Meijaard and Douglas Sheil and Manuel R Guariguata and Robert Nasi and Terry Sunderland and Louis Putzel,66,,,,CIFOR,A major challenge in trading ecosystem services is the need to quantify and commoditise services. for monitoring and verification as well as for trade. This is relatively straightforward for goods such as forest honey or shade-grown coffee. but potentially complex for services such as water purification. reducing risk from floods or other disasters or carbon sequestration. Developing certification systems for forest ecosystem services is one potential way to define. quantify and verify these services in a way that buyers can trust. and this is why certification of ecosystem services is promoted by a number of environmental and forestry NGOs. Certification of ecosystem services is a useful concept. but many practical and theoretical obstacles must be addressed before it can be put into practice. This paper is a review of existing development in certification of ecosystem services. with information useful for designing and implementing projects to evaluate the efficacy of new systems. We discuss the potential use of more holistic concepts for measuring management sustainability. which are to date undeveloped and untested. and recommend developing pilot projects that are specifically designed to address a number of challenges inherent to ecosystem service certification.,True,8RH7cKoAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,21,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2pN4p00NIkoC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=info:rUNS4hS94ZkJ:scholar.google.com&ots=hLGeD5mV64&sig=LUOpFEOya0TO95Fil-cG_5rkk1Y,11088351654956909485,/scholar?cites=11088351654956909485,,,0,0,0

Hennig proposed that characters be conceptualized as “transformation series”. a proposal that is firmly grounded in evolutionary theory and consistent with the method of inferring transformation events as evidence of phylogenetic propinquity. Nevertheless. that concept is usually overlooked or rejected in favor of others based on similarity. Here we explicate Hennig's definition of character as an ideographic concept in the science of phylogenetic systematics. As transformation series. characters are historical individuals akin to species and clades. As such. the related concept of homology refers to a historical identity relation and is not equivalent to or synonymous with synapomorphy.

We simulated an invasion of the acoustic niche by exposing calling native male white-banded tree frogs (Hypsiboas albomarginatus) to recorded invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) calls. In response. tree frogs immediately shifted calls to significantly higher frequencies. In the post-stimulus period. they continued to use higher frequencies while also decreasing signal duration. Acoustic signals are the primary basis of mate selection in many anurans. suggesting that such changes could negatively affect the reproductive success of native species.

It is characterized. in part. by small size. gray throat and Finger III strongly swollen in adult males. and an advertisement call of 10 notes with emphasized frequencies at 4920–6040 Hz. Material examined revealed extensive variation in dorsal. ventral. and thigh coloration. In numerous adult males from several localities Finger II is also swollen. The swelling of Finger II varies intraspecifically. possibly as a function of male reproductive activity.Vocalizations of Colostethus trilineatus recorded at the type locality are temporally distinct from those reported from other localities.

There are many practical reasons for this. including parsimony's intuitive simplicity. applicability to diverse character data. computational speed. and unique statistical properties as a nonparametric method. The epistem‐ological argument for parsimony as maximising explanatory power by minimising ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy (MAH) has been accepted by many workers. However. in addition to philosophical problems. this justification of parsimony can lead to contradictory results under dynamic homology analysis. Because of the decoupling of homoplasy and tree length under dynamic homology analysis. trees of the same length but different amounts of homoplasy would have different parsimony scores. while trees of different lengths but the same amount of homoplasy would be considered equally parsimonious …,True,lzr5IbEAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,48,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1017/S147720000999017X,12479159490529722920,/scholar?cites=12479159490529722920,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1083.1273&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Three types of tests of discovery operations are commonly employed in evolutionary biology.

Migration usually occurs at night in order to avoid desiccation and predation. However. some amphibians also migrate during the day. and it has been proposed that this may have evolved as a result of poisonous skin secretions and aposematic coloration that release individuals from visually oriented diurnal predators. Based on this hypothesis and recent observations of 24 h breeding activity in the poisonous. aposematic toad Melanophryniscus cambaraensis. we predicted that migration in this species would occur equally during the day and night.

We refute Giribet's (2003a) claim that WCSA is the strictest possible test for a given phylogenetic hypothesis. Giribet's (2003a) classification of data exploration methods as evaluating “nodal stability” or “nodal support” is arbitrary. at odds with common usage and actually obscures the relationships between the methods he examined. all of which seek to assess the sensitivity of results to variation in analytical conditions. Stability. whether statistical or taxonomic. is not a goal of phylogenetic science.

How the Peruvian government understands drivers of deforestation in the Amazon has profound implications for how it will confront the problem. It is therefore important to critically revisit assumptions underlying this narrative.

Multinational corporations control almost 40% of the world market in forest products. constituting a major stakeholder in global forest policy. The few cases of direct intervention by multinational corporations at international fora suggest their interests are expressed elsewhere. The authors identify and discuss three types of intervention in the existing forest regime: avoidance. enforcement-driven compliance. and performance-driven compliance.

Small-scale timber producers have been marginalized in the sector in the past. and the new regulations claim to provide pathways to formalization for these actors. We draw on policy analysis and field research in the central Amazon region of Peru using mixed methods to characterize smallholder on-farm timber production and evaluate the feasibility of the new regulatory mechanisms for formalizing small-scale timber producers.

1192097,New forestry on the floodplain: the ecology and management of Calycophyllum spruceanum (Rubiaceae) on the Amazon landscape,2003,Robin Sears,,,,,,In Amazonia. the over-extraction of traditional timber species provides incentive for private landholders to maintain and enrich impoverished forests and agricultural fallows with important timber species. In their fields. fallows. forests and house gardens. smallholder farmers on the seasonal floodplain. the varzea. in Peru and Brazil optimize the production of a diversity of crops. manage forest resources. and maintain critical ecosystem services through an integrated system of production and conservation. One native tree. Calycophyllum spruceanum (Rubiaceae). is prominent in these production systems and natural forests. providing timber. fuelwood. and construction material for local and commercial use. This species. a fast-growing hardwood. is dominant in forests and fallows on the varzea accounting for up to seventy percent of stand basal area. Research on the population ecology of C. spruceanum (capirona in Peru. pau mulato in Brazil). coupled with information on local management techniques. provides insight into how smallholder farmers take full advantage of the species' ecological flexibility to produce timber and fuelwood. and highlights the ecological and economic benefits of managing a tree cover in a threatened ecosystem. This study highlights the silvicultural techniques farmers use to promote C. spruceanum. and other tree species. Its abilities for abundant natural regeneration. coppicing. rapid growth to both agricultural and fluvial disturbance afford this economically important tree species advantages for sustainable forest management.

Dordrecht,In this paper we analyze and discuss the multifunctionality of várzea forests and their role in the conservation and sustainable use of várzea biodiversity. Based on data collected over the last 10 years in three várzea regions. we argue that the dynamic function of the várzea forest facilitates the application of spatially and temporally heterogeneous management systems. and the resulting use regime enhances rather than undermines ecosystems services and goods. Among a complex array of outcomes from managing várzea forests include a number of ecosystem services (i.e.. seed dispersion as well as nesting grounds for fish. birds. and other várzea inhabitants) as well as products (i.e.. timber. fruits. fish).

Due to the mountainous nature of this country. our particular interest is in the impacts of upstream forest activity on downstream stakeholders. Our hypothetical framework identifies specific causal pathways between forests and the four pillars of GNH (environmental conservation. cultural preservation. equitable socioeconomic development and good governance). and evidence was sought in the published literature to test the hypothesis. While conceptual support for many linkages between forests and each of the pillars was found in the literature. evidential support specifically for Bhutan is limited. The strongest evidence is found for the role of forests in socioeconomic development and good governance. particularly through the community forestry program. To develop incentive programs for forest conservation and restoration. such as payment for ecosystem services and pay-for-performance donor funding. the evidence base needs to be expanded for causal pathways between upstream forest condition and downstream security. particularly for services such as water regulation.

Key information necessary is how different forest user groups perceive and prioritize different ecosystem services based on their local setting. We assessed the socio-cultural values of ecosystem services of high-altitude oak forests in Western Bhutan using participatory approaches with two important forest users: local communities and forest experts. We found that these forests serve as a pool of 22 ecosystem services under four MEA categories of provisioning (9). regulating (8). supporting (2). and cultural (3) services. Fresh water was unanimously identified as the most valuable service. as well as the most vulnerable. by both the groups. The priorities of local communities inclined towards provisioning and cultural services due to their dependence on these services for their livelihood and wellbeing. Forest experts’ priorities were more evenly spread over three categories of services: provisioning. regulating. and supporting services. reflecting their broader interest in resource management. biodiversity conservation. and climate change mitigation. Several regulating and supporting services were not easily identified by many villagers. suggesting that bridging the priorities of local interests with broader national forestry goals may require public partnerships and integrated decision-making about the entire suite of ecosystem services.

This monophyletic group of primitive birds comprises c. 47 ground dwelling species whose habitats range from dense humid forest to open grasslands. The relationship between frequency and body mass was found to be negative. while the songs of open-habitat species exhibited higher frequencies and a wider bandwidth than the closed-habitat ones.

Tinamous are a monophyletic group of primitive birds comprising at least 47 ground dwelling species with prominent or exclusive paternal care of eggs and offspring. Although the size of females exceeded that of males in most considered species. we found an isometric relationship between males and females. instead of the negative allometric one predicted by Rensch's rule.

The evolutionary history of modern birds,,187-208,John Wiley & Sons,At the beginning of the Tertiary. while mammals were undergoing an evolutionary explosion. several groups of birds developed a tendency to gigantism. These groups were scattered across almost the whole planet. The Gastornithidae (also known as Diatrymidae). with possible affinity with the Anseriformes (Andors. 1992). have been recovered from Paleocene and Eocene deposits in North America. Europe and Asia (Matthew & Granger. 1917; Martin. 1992; Hou. 1980). In Australia. another group of giant birds. the Dromornithidae. with possible affinity to the Anseriformes (Wroe. 1998; Murray & Vickers-Rich. 2004) had a broad diversity in the mid-Tertiary. Among these. Dromornis stirtoni would have been comparable in size to the largest birds ever found. The Ratitae. also present since the Paleocene in South America and possibly in Europe (Alvarenga. 1983; Martin. 1992). is another group remarkable for the large size reached in several species. Among the giant birds of the Tertiary. they are the only present-day survivors. The elephant-bird. Aepyornis maximus. a ratite from Madagascar that died out around 700 years ago. is probably the biggest bird ever found (Amadon. 1947; Wetmore. 1967).,True,SuUu81gAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,35,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=GdRnFn7I38kC&oi=fnd&pg=PA187&dq=info:1F_c0usDh-sJ:scholar.google.com&ots=8X6Y5DN__m&sig=q5pesMZ3-7-8iOluCYK9ZHXZniE,16971538032158859220,/scholar?cites=16971538032158859220,,,0,0,0

In spite of this. very little is known about the phylogeny of this Neotropical group. Two new studies produced phylogenies for the family using external and internal morphology (237 characters) and mitochondrial (1143 bp) and nuclear (1145 bp) DNA sequences. respectively. The two hypotheses had some similarities but also several disagreements: both recovered a clade of aridland tinamous but they disagreed on the monophyly of the forest-dwelling tinamous. as well as on the relationships within these two groups. Here we summarize the previous two studies and combine the morphological and molecular dataset into a single analysis. In the weighted combined hypothesis. the family is divided into two monophyletic groups. one composed of forest taxa. and one of aridland taxa. This is also one of the two alternative hypotheses recovered in unweighted analyses. The combined tree also places Eudromia and Tinamotis as basal within the aridland tinamous. and recovers all traditional genera as monophyletic.

Like other fossils from these marine deposits. the partial skeleton is three-dimensionally preserved and articulated. This new Danish specimen consists of a skull. vertebral column. ribs. pelvis. and hindlimbs. Concerning characters of the pelvis. tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus. the new fossil bears morphological affinities to charadriiform birds (shorebirds and relatives). A phylogenetic analysis of higher neomithine (modern birds) taxa also supports a close relationship between the new specimen and modern Charadriiformes.

1192137,Pigmentation characters: an example of Sankoff characters from tinamou phylogeny,2004,Sara Bertelli,15,Ornitol. Neotrop,,285-291,,In a cladistic analysis of tinamous. special attention was paid to character definition and scoring of non-traditional characters for phylogenetic reconstruction of birds. For example. transformation costs between states were applied (Sankoff characters) to analyze the egg coloration on the basis of pigment composition. In this scheme. lesser costs were assigned to transformations between more similar states. This approach is similar to that applied to plumage characters (overlap of pigmentation patterns) in a previous study. The present study shows that changes between several states of pigmentation characters are not a consequence of the imposed penalty in the cost regime. but an interaction with other characters. This is interpreted as evidence that multistate characters with complex costs among characters states (as in pigmentation characters) are not an artifact and should be used to describe relative degrees of similarity.,True,SuUu81gAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,3,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sara_Bertelli/publication/238582683_Pigmentation_characters_an_exemple_of_Sankoff_characters_from_tinamous_phylogeny/links/53d64d0e0cf228d363ea4cc8/Pigmentation-characters-an-exemple-of-Sankoff-characters-from-tinamous-phylogeny.pdf,11357950482782647587,/scholar?cites=11357950482782647587,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sara_Bertelli/publication/238582683_Pigmentation_characters_an_exemple_of_Sankoff_characters_from_tinamous_phylogeny/links/53d64d0e0cf228d363ea4cc8/Pigmentation-characters-an-exemple-of-Sankoff-characters-from-tinamous-phylogeny.pdf,0,0,0

For example. Conservation International and The Nature Conservancy are now legally registered in at least 18 and 23 developing world countries. respectively (21. 22). This provides greater accountability to national governments and donors. but also enables them to compete for funds with local NGOs. which may decrease efforts to strengthen local institutions. This can result in developing-world conservationists. with locally tuned priorities but lacking donor connections. being obliged to obtain funds from INGOs pushing global agendas. Ultimately. this can lead to INGOs edging out local institutions essential for sustaining longterm conservation (19). It also means that changes in donor or INGO priorities can lead to abrupt withdrawals of support. Conservation efforts then fail if local conservationists have not been trained. or local institutions have not been developed with their own programs and funding. Training is usually insufficiently supported: eg. only 4% of the US $3.26 billion invested in Latin American biodiversity conservation between 1990 and 1997 was specifically spent on capacity building (23). Similarly. the US Agency for International Development. a key supporter of international conservation. has cut back university scholarships in all fields for developing world students to 900 per year from a previous 20.000 (24). Furthermore. the lack of long-term career structures often results in scarce local practitioners migrating to developed countries. weakening conservation infrastructure in front-line countries.

However. population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats. focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus). the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models. we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example. the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (λ = 1.01).

An analysis of wetland mosaics was performed for two regions of the northeastern United States to assess the degree to which historical wetland loss alters the metrics of wetland mosaics and to assess potential future effects mediated by differently structured wetland regulations.

We examined the issue through a modeling study that integrated road maps and traffic‐volume data with simulated movements of (1) small‐bodied pond turtles.

Our model predicted that road networks typical of the northeastern. southeastern. and central regions have the potential to limit land‐turtle populations and. to a lesser extent. populations of large‐bodied pond turtles. Nowhere are populations of small‐bodied pond turtles likely threatened regionally by road mortality.

To address the issue. we captured painted turtles ( Chrysemys picta; n = 174) and snapping turtles ( Chelydra serpentina; n = 56) in 18 wetlands surrounded by low road density (≤1.5 km roads/km2 of landscape) and 17 wetlands surrounded by high road density (>1.5 km/km2) in central New York in 2002. High road density was associated with male‐biased sex ratios in painted turtles (74% vs. 54% males; p = 0.01) and snapping turtles (95% vs. 74% males; p = 0.08). whereas turtle morphology and abundance were not associated with road density.

Moreover. the United States' road network has expanded dramatically over the last century. We therefore predicted that historical trends in sex ratios of turtle populations would be male biased. To test this prediction. we synthesized published estimates of population‐level sex ratios in freshwater and terrestrial turtles in the United States (165 estimates for 36 species. published 1928–2003). Our analysis suggests that the proportion of males in populations has increased linearly (p= 0.001); the trend in male bias is synchronized with the expansion of the surfaced portion of the road network since 1930; sex ratios became more male biased in states with higher densities of roads; and populations have become more male biased in aquatic species …,True,kcMBVpkAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,251,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2005.000155.x,4103854951156258665,/scholar?cites=4103854951156258665,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Steen3/publication/227620733_Trends_in_Sex_Ratios_of_Turtles_in_the_United_States_Implications_of_Road_Mortality/links/5e1c875a92851c8364cbb19f/Trends-in-Sex-Ratios-of-Turtles-in-the-United-States-Implications-of-Road-Mortality.pdf,0,0,0

Population projections based on spotted salamander life tables imply that an annual risk of road mortality for adults of >10% can lead to local population extirpation; mitigation efforts (tunnels. road closures. and other measures) should seek to reduce road mortality rates to below this threshold. For central and western Massachusetts. we estimated that salamanders would be exposed to at least this threshold level of risk at 22–73% of populations (assuming a 100 vs. 500 m migration distance. respectively).

For these reasons. population monitoring plays a critical role in animal ecology and wildlife conservation. Changes in abundance are the typical focus. although changes in reproductive or survival rates that are the characteristics ofindividuals. or other population parameters. also are monitored. Consequently. many researchers and managers devote considerable effort and resources to population monitoring. In doing so. they generally assume that systematic surveys in different years will detect the same proportion of a population in every year and changes in the survey numbers will reflect changes in population size. Unfortunately. these assumptions are often violated. In particular. the following two questions are pertinent to any animal ecologist involved in population monitoring. First. is the index of population abundance used valid? That is. does variation in. for example. track densities ofmammals. amphibian captures in sweep nets. or counts of singing birds reliably reflect changes in local populations of these organisms?

We provide two example case studies of projects and summarize the key themes and recommendations associated with each of those outcomes.

Cigliano,29,Behavioral Ecology & Sociobiology,1,55-59,Springer,We investigated the importance of song length and singing rate in stimulating female white-throated sparrows. Zonotrichia albicollis. In November 1988 ten female and one male white-throated sparrow were captured during the fall migration. To enhance the expression of sexual receptivity. the females were implanted with 17-beta-estradiol silastic pellets. Using the visual stimulus of a non-singing male to further enhance the expression of sexual receptivity in the females. we found that females gave a greater response. in the form of copulation displays. to a five-note versus a two-note version of a typical male white-throated sparrow song. Each version was played back at four songs per minute. In May 1990 birds were captured and treated as before. except that the two-note song was played at ten songs per minute and the five-note song at four songs per minute.

1192193,Dominance and den use in Octopus bimaculoides,1993,John A Cigliano,46,Animal behaviour,4,677-684,Academic Press, Past studies have indicated that dominance relationships based on size occur in octopuses. It is unclear. however. why this behaviour evolved since octopuses are solitary animals that do not form social aggregations. The hypothesis that dominance determines den use when dens are limited and vary in quality was tested using Octopus bimaculoides. The results from this study support this hypothesis. In a large circular tank. three octopuses competed for two dens that varied in quality and there was a significant association between den use and dominance rank. Wet weight and mantle length were highly correlated and both were good predictors of the dominance of an individual. The results also suggest that O. bimaculoides is able to recognize whether an individual is dominant or subordinate to it and that this recognition occurs quickly.,True,InGLd6wAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347283712443,18437096663276625129,/scholar?cites=18437096663276625129,,,0,0,0
1192194,Assessment of the mating history of female pygmy octopuses and a possible sperm competition mechanism,1995,John A Cigliano,49,Animal Behaviour,3,849-851,Academic Press,Sperm precedence has been reported for a wide range of taxa with internal fertilization (see Smith 1984; Birkhead & Mnller 1992). For sperm precedence to occur.(1) females must be able to store viable sperm for an extended period of time.(2) there must be a delay between mating and fertilization. and (3) more than one male must mate with the female during the delay (Waage. 1984). Octopuses (Octopodidae: Octopus) meet all three criteria. Females store viable sperm in two oviducal glands for up to 10 months before laying eggs. there is a considerable delay between mating and egg laying. and females remain sexually receptive after mating (Mangold 1987). Moreover. males of some species exhibit prolonged copulation. transferring several to many spermatophores (Wells & Wells 1972; personal observation). This has been termed sperm loading and functions in some taxa as a sperm competition mechanism to flush out or dilute the sperm of previous males (Dickinson 1986; Birkhead & Hunter 1990).Because of the evidence suggesting that sperm precedence via sperm competition might be occurring in octopuses. I examined the mating behaviour of the pygmy octopus (Octopodidae: Octopus). I tested the prediction that if sperm competition is occurring. a male will modify his mating behaviour if he is mated to a recently mated female. as observed in other taxa (eg Corder0 1990). Specifically. the second male might transfer more sperm if sperm loading is occurring. OF show a greater latency of spermatophore transfer if he is manually displacing or removing previously deposited sperm (Birkhead & Hunter 1990).,True,InGLd6wAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,42,https://www.academia.edu/download/58329750/MatingHistory_SpermCompetition_PygmyOctopus.pdf,7566364466993066390,/scholar?cites=7566364466993066390,,https://www.academia.edu/download/58329750/MatingHistory_SpermCompetition_PygmyOctopus.pdf,0,0,0

It is common knowledge that this is a place to present your research. but what about other benefits of attending a conference? Online surveys were distributed to delegates of the 3rd and 4th International Marine Conservation Congresses (IMCCs). with respondents’ (n=100) feedback including that the congresses provided useful new information that will aid: (1) their research (58%); (2) in-the-field conservation (29%); (3) conservation communication (46%); and (4) conservation and management policy making (45%). They also reported gaining new techniques (56%). skills (64%). and novel ideas (70%) to further their research/careers. Nearly all (91%) gained new contacts that improved their research. in-the-field conservation. science communication. and/or conservation policy making. Two-thirds (64%) gained ideas. contacts. and/or lessons could lead to publications. Over a third (39%) gained new ideas. contacts and/or lessons that led to grant proposals. and 36% gained contacts that led to funding. A conference is not just an avenue for a scientist to present their research to the wider community. but it can be an important venue for brainstorming. networking and making vital connections that can lead to new initiatives. papers and funding. in a way that virtual. online meetings cannot.

They give us opportunities to present our research. to network and create future career opportunities. and to recruit researchers to our teams (Parsons. 2015). Many fruitful collaborations have spawned from chance meetings at conferences. and doubtless innumerable conservation solutions have stemmed from conversations over coffee at these important events. Therefore. whenever there is inequity of access to science conferences. the entire discipline suffers. Conservation science is tasked with saving the Earth’s biodiversity. so for us. inequity means the biosphere suffers as well. But most importantly. individuals who are passionate about conservation can be driven out of the field due to disillusion and distrust.The accessibility of any event is determined in part by how safe it is to attend. and safety is tied closely to one’s gender. gender identity. sexual orientation. race. religion. and other factors. While this is uncomfortable to acknowledge. science continues to experience cases of harassment. intimidation. bullying. and discrimination. Recently. the United States’ National Science Foundation released a statement making clear that they will not tolerate harassment at grantee institutions. encouraged reporting. and indicated a readiness to terminate funding to institutions that do not comply with national discrimination legislation (NSF. 2016).

However. lip thickness (LT) limits are used to manage juvenile mortality and reduce risk of growth overfishing in other countries. Empirical studies suggest relationships between LT and sexual maturity vary spatially and need to be determined locally. This study was conducted to determine the most reliable. easily measurable proxy indicator(s) of maturity and associated target size limits in L. gigas that can effectively restrict harvest of juveniles. Morphological measures (SL. LT. lip width. unprocessed meat weight. MCW. operculum dimensions). gonadosomatic index (GSI) and histological evaluations were recorded from L. gigas collected in PHMR before. during. and after the L. gigas closed season. Upon determining Period 2 (during closed season) as the peak reproductive period. relationships between these variables in Period 2 were examined. No relationship was found in males between SL and maturity. and was weak in females. whereas there were significant curvilinear relationships between LT and GSI for both sexes. suggesting urgent need to base size limits on LT not SL. LT at which 50% of the population was mature (LT50) was 15.51mm for females and 12.33mm for males. therefore a 16mm LT limit is recommended. MCW of female L. gigas was also significantly related to GSI. indicating MCW may be an appropriate management tool in conjunction with LT as it can be measured at landing sites whereas shells are usually discarded at sea.

This ScB Marine Section believed that there was a need for an international conference that headlined the conservation issues and threats to our coasts and ocean; and would start to delineate solutions. Therefore. the ScB Marine Section held the first international Marine conservation congress (iMcc) at george Mason University. Fairfax. virginia. from 17–24 May. 2009. The Marine Section Board’s vision for the congress was to produce a venue that would facilitate discussion and collaboration among natural and social scientists. managers. policy-makers. and the public so that marine conservation science could better inform policy and management decisions affecting marine biodiversity. iMcc1 was organized around major themes and cross-cutting issues that encompass topics of global relevance and importance to marine conservation. Major themes included: global climate change. the land-sea interface. ecosystem-based management. and poverty and globalization. cross-cutting issues included: marine protected areas. education and outreach. governance arrangements. fisheries and aquaculture. and economics.The need for this meeting. the first stand-alone meeting of the Marine Section. was validated by the response of the international scientific community. in total. the iMcc attracted over 1200 international participants from nearly 80 countries. including academics (natural and social scientists). policy-makers …,True,InGLd6wAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Cigliano/publication/263247888_Making_Marine_Science_Matter-A_Special_Issue_Highlighting_the_First_International_Marine_Conservation_Congress_19-24_May_2009_Washington_DC/links/5c58e679458515a4c7590a0c/Making-Marine-Science-Matter-A-Special-Issue-Highlighting-the-First-International-Marine-Conservation-Congress-19-24-May-2009-Washington-DC.pdf,5855083558829247394,/scholar?cites=5855083558829247394,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Cigliano/publication/263247888_Making_Marine_Science_Matter-A_Special_Issue_Highlighting_the_First_International_Marine_Conservation_Congress_19-24_May_2009_Washington_DC/links/5c58e679458515a4c7590a0c/Making-Marine-Science-Matter-A-Special-Issue-Highlighting-the-First-International-Marine-Conservation-Congress-19-24-May-2009-Washington-DC.pdf,0,0,0

There is pressure in academia to publish in academic journals (especially high impact factor journals; conservation journals typically have an impact factor of< 4). but these typically have few readers and generally do not include those who need the information (eg. conservation practitioners. managers. policymakers). Academic promotion is often dependent on bringing money into the university. ie. gaining grants. with a high proportion of the grant overhead going to the institution. whereas conservation grants are typically small. with little to spare for overhead.

This article reports experimental data from an annual herb. Clarkia concinna. documenting that small patches suffered reproductive failure due to lack of effective pollination when critical thresholds of isolation were exceeded. In contrast. sufficiently large patches attracted pollinators regardless of their degree of isolation. These data accord with data on patch extinctions showing that small and isolated patches have a higher extinction rate than do large patches and with observations showing chronically low reproductive success in such patches prior to extinction. While not conclusively demonstrating that Allee effects cause extinction in small and isolated patches. the data are suggestive.

There are general principles that should be used in developing guidelines for certifying biodiversity‐friendly biofuels. First. biofuel feedstocks should be grown with environmentally safe and biodiversity‐friendly agricultural practices. The sustainability of any biofuel feedstock depends on good growing practices and sound environmental practices throughout the fuel‐production life cycle. Second. the ecological footprint of a biofuel. in terms of the land area needed to grow sufficient quantities of the feedstock. should be minimized.

But in the real world. financial considerations make this strategy impossible. especially given the number of species whose status is already cause for concern. Thus it is an inescapable fact that for all but the rarest of species. TNC will need to focus on preserving only a subset of the known populations. and upon this choice will rest the success of the entire mission. To make this choice. Conservancy staff require the means to find answers. at the very least qualitative and conditional ones. to two critical questions. First. what is the likelihood that a known population of a species of conservation concern will persist for a given amount of time? Second. how many populations must be preserved to achieve a reasonable chance that at least one of them will avoid extinction for a specified period of time? The goal of this handbook is to introduce practical methods for seeking quantitative answers to these two questions. methods that can provide some guidance in the absence of highly detailed information that is unlikely to be available for most rare species.

MA,One of the critical challenges in conservation biology is to develop quantitative methods for evaluating the fate of populations that are threatened by human activities (Soulé 1987). Predicting population responses to various perturbations. such as habitat destruction. harvest. or supplementation via reintroduction. requires some practical analyses of population viability. These “population viability analyses” (PVAs) have come into increasing usage. and every indication is that their importance will rise in the future. A recent National Research Council panel convened to evaluate the Endangered Species Act vigorously recommended even greater reliance on viability models (NRC 1996). as have many other groups of biologists seeking to improve management of endangered and rare species (e.g..

1192229,Consequences of subpopulation isolation for pollination. herbivory. and population growth in Clarkia concinna concinna (Onagraceae),2001,Martha J Groom,100,Biological Conservation,1,55-63,Elsevier,The importance of the spatial arrangement of populations for long-term persistence has been debated. Plant species will be influenced mostly by the responses of their pollinators and herbivores to changes in population isolation. making it hard to predict how habitat fragmentation may affect a plant species. I have used a common annual to examine how population isolation may affect reproductive success and ultimately population growth and persistence. Clarkia concinna concinna exhibits considerable pollen limitation when small populations are isolated. although it also endures less herbivory. For this plant. isolation appears mostly to depress population growth and therefore to enhance risks of extinction. Experimental investigations on common species such as C. concinna concinna can be used to better diagnose threats to endangered taxa. and to design appropriate restoration activities.,True,Tk_eDysAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,99,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632070000207X,8840809783933662596,/scholar?cites=8840809783933662596,,,0,0,0

Ligustrum lucidum is the most abundant exotic tree in secondary forest patches of montane forests of NW Argentina. We studied the determinants of success of the early stages of its life cycle in distinct habitat types. with the hope of identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited to control the invasion. Seed arrival. germination. seedling recruitment and survival. and sapling growth were studied in edges. gaps and forest interior. Seed arrival was also assessed under perches and in open fields. Germination was studied in forest and grass-land patches. L. lucidum seedling survival and sapling growth were compared with the most abundant native species survival and growth. Seed arrival was strongly seasonal with a peak in mid-August. Seed rain did not differ significantly among habitat types. however there was a tendency for edges to receive more seeds when only dispersed seeds were considered. Perches strongly enhanced seed arrival; more than 40 times the number of seeds were dispersed beneath citrus plants (i.e. perches) than found in paired open areas. In the forest. seeds in gaps and edges had higher germination rates. but there was no difference in seedling survival. Fruits under closed canopy exhibited the lowest germination. Germination and survival were low in open areas. Neither seedling recruitment nor sapling growth differed between gaps and forest interior. L. lucidum saplings grew significantly more than saplings of the most common native species. and also showed higher seedling survival. L. lucidum is a prolific fruit …,True,Tk_eDysAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,89,https://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php?pid=S0034-77442003000100004&script=sci_arttext,8804122280815015803,/scholar?cites=8804122280815015803,,https://www.scielo.sa.cr/scielo.php?pid=S0034-77442003000100004&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Many planners and conservation scientists have called for broader use of planning and regulatory tools to support the conservation of biodiversity at local scales. Yet little is known about the pervasiveness of these practices. We conducted an on‐line survey of county. municipal. and tribal planning directors (n =116) in 3 geographic regions of the United States: metropolitan Seattle. Washington; metropolitan Des Moines. Iowa; and the Research Triangle. North Carolina. Our objectives were to gauge the extent to which local planning departments address biodiversity conservation and to identify factors that facilitate or hinder conservation actions in local planning.

I provide an overview of patterns of extinction and species endangerment. and describe efforts employed to slow and reverse these trends. The first step is to review the major types of threats to biodiversity. while laying the groundwork for the more in-depth coverage of these topics later in the book. Habitat degradation includes the spectrum of total conversion from a usable to an unusable habitat type (or “habitat loss”). severe degradation and pollution that makes a habitat more dangerous or difficult for an organism to live in. and fragmentation that can reduce population viability. Habitat degradation can be caused by a host of human activities including industry. agriculture. forestry. aquaculture. fishing. mining. sediment and groundwater extraction. infrastructure development. and habitat modification as a result of species introductions. changes in native species abundance. or changes in fire or other …,True,Tk_eDysAAAAJ:tBp-nognM3UC,81,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=617908040703483443&hl=en&oi=scholarr,617908040703483443,/scholar?cites=617908040703483443,,,0,0,0

While the value of birds as biological controls in coffee has received some attention. the interactions between birds and other predators of insects have not been tested. We used exclosures to examine the effects of vertebrate predators on the arthropods associated with coffee. in particular the coffee leafminer (Leucoptera coffeella) and the flatid planthopper Petrusa epilepsis. in a shaded coffee plantation in Puerto Rico. We used a 2 × 2 factorial design with four treatments: exclusion of birds. lizards. birds and lizards. and control (no exclusion). Abundance of insects >5 mm increased when birds or both birds and lizards were removed. Birds and lizards had an additive effect for insects <5 mm and for all insects combined.

Puerto Rico. Both coffee plantations contained patches of second‐growth forest but differed in shade types; one was a rustic plantation with a species‐diverse shade including many fruiting plant species and the other was a commercial polyculture shaded almost solely by Inga vera. We quantified foraging activity of five fruit‐eating bird species (Euphonia musica. Loxigillaportoricensis. Nesospingusspeculifirus. Spinetalisportoricensis. and Vireo altiloquous) and monthly fruit abundance in the coffee plantation and adjacent second‐growth forest habitats at each site.

Over the last 40 years the native vegetation surrounding the park has been converted to agriculture. but the region still supports virtually all of the animals native to the area.

Identification of landscape features that will promote persistence of a diverse array of species is a high priority. particularly. for protected areas that reside in regions of otherwise extensive habitat loss. This is the case for Emas National Park. a small but important protected area located in the Brazilian Cerrado. the world's most biologically diverse savanna. Emas Park is a large-mammal global conservation priority area but is too small to protect wide-ranging mammals for the long-term and conserving these populations will depend on the landscape surrounding the park. We employed novel. noninvasive methods to determine the relative importance of resources found within the park. as well as identify landscape features that promote persistence of wide-ranging mammals outside reserve borders. We used scat detection dogs to survey for five large mammals of conservation concern: giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus). giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla). maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus). jaguar (Panthera onca). and puma (Puma concolor). We estimated resource selection probability functions for each species from 1.572 scat locations and 434 giant armadillo burrow locations. Results indicate that giant armadillos and jaguars are highly selective of natural habitats. which makes both species sensitive to landscape change from agricultural development.
