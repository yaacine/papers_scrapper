Dying cells emit signaling molecules that accelerate intestinal stem cell proliferation and progenitor differentiation to replace the dying cells quickly. This process has been named ‘regenerative cell death’. Here. mimicking environmental conditions. we show that the ingestion of low levels of opportunistic bacteria was sufficient to launch an accelerated cellular renewal program despite the brief passage of bacteria in the gut and the absence of cell death and this is is due to the moderate induction of the JNK pathway that stimulates stem cell proliferation. Consequently. the addition of new differentiated cells to the gut epithelium. without preceding cell loss. leads to enterocyte overcrowding.

1075787,The DH31/CGRP enteroendocrine peptide triggers intestinal contractions favoring the elimination of opportunistic bacteria,2018,Olivia Benguettat and Rouba Jneid and Julie Soltys and Rihab Loudhaief and Alexandra Brun-Barale and Dani Osman and Armel Gallet,14,PLoS pathogens,9,e1007279,Public Library of Science,The digestive tract is the first organ affected by the ingestion of foodborne bacteria. While commensal bacteria become resident. opportunistic or virulent bacteria are eliminated from the gut by the local innate immune system. Here we characterize a new mechanism of defense. independent of the immune system. in Drosophila melanogaster. We observed strong contractions of longitudinal visceral muscle fibers for the first 2 hours following bacterial ingestion. We showed that these visceral muscle contractions are induced by immune reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate in the lumen and depend on the ROS-sensing TRPA1 receptor. We then demonstrate that both ROS and TRPA1 are required in a subset of anterior enteroendocrine cells for the release of the DH31 neuropeptide which activates its receptor in the neighboring visceral muscles. The resulting contractions of the visceral muscles favors quick expulsion of the bacteria. limiting their presence in the gut. Our results unveil a precocious mechanism of defense against ingested opportunistic bacteria. whether they are Gram-positive like Bacillus thuringiensis or Gram-negative like Erwinia carotovora carotovora.

1075788,The cellular homeostasis of the gut: what the Drosophila model points out,2015,Matthieu Y Pasco and Rihab Loudhaief and Armel Gallet,,,,,F. Hernández y Juan F. Madrid. Universidad de Murcia: Departamento de Biología Celular e Histología,The digestive tract is subjected to many aggressions throughout animal life. Since disruptions of gut physiology impact on animal fitness and survival. maintenance of gut integrity and functionality is essential for the individual. Over the last 40 years. research on rodents has aimed at understanding how cellular homeostasis of the digestive tract is maintained when challenged with disruptions. Following the discovery of stem cells in the digestive tract of Drosophila. a flurry of studies made an important contribution to our understanding of how the proliferation and the differentiation of these cells are controlled and participate in the renewal of the digestive tract. Insights into these mechanisms in Drosophila have revealed many similarities with mammalian intestinal stem cells. For instance. the highly conserved EGFR. JAK/STAT. Wingless/Wnt. Hedgehog. Integrins. BMP/TGFβ. Hippo and Insulin pathways all participate in adult intestinal cellular homeostasis. Here. we provide a literature review of recent advances in the field highlighting the adult Drosophila midgut as a convenient model for dissecting mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the cellular homeostasis of the digestive tract in conventionally reared conditions. In addition. we shed light on recently published data putting Drosophila forward as a genetic tool to decipher the mechanisms underlying intestinal diseases and intestinal tumour progression.,True,1HFl1IMAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,17,https://digitum.um.es/digitum/handle/10201/88078,16458346715425847046,/scholar?cites=16458346715425847046,,https://digitum.um.es/digitum/bitstream/10201/88078/1/Pasco-30-277-292-2015.pdf,0,0,0

1075799,The effect of general anaesthesia on the mammalian circadian clock and its clinical implications and potential treatment,2017,Nicola Ludin,,,,,,Patients frequently sleep poorly following an operation. This may be due. in part. to the effect of general anaesthesia on the circadian clock. The aim of this thesis was to understand the effect of general anaesthesia on the mammalian circadian clock and sleep. the relevance of this to the post-operative patient. and how these effects may be modified by intra-operative light administration. Previous data from our group’s work on the honey bee revealed that the general anaesthetic isoflurane causes phase delays of the circadian clock as a result of a shift in the expression of core circadian clock genes (cryptochrome and period). In addition. concurrent administration of light during anaesthesia in honey bees resulted in a reduction of the general anaesthesia-induced phase shift. In order to determine whether isoflurane causes robust and reproducible phase shifts in mammals. and whether these effects result from isoflurane acting directly on the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). I developed a system to enable the examination of the effect of isoflurane on PER2::LUC mouse SCNs. PER2::LUC SCN tissue was cultured over eight days (n=36) and exposed to a six hour 2% isoflurane anaesthetic (or air control) after four cycles. Phase shifts and period changes were analysed using the peak expression time (acrophase) on each of the days following anaesthesia or control. compared to the days prior. Administration of a six hour isoflurane anaesthetic to SCNs between circadian times eight and 16 (CT8-CT16) resulted in an average phase delay of -6.99 hours (1.34 SEM) compared to controls at similar CTs that showed an average phase delay of only -1.33 …,True,iHMw4_UAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/36764,6340715526529833089,/scholar?cites=6340715526529833089,,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/36764/whole.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

Here. we provide the first comprehensive time-dependent analysis of the effects of the commonly administered inhalational anaesthetic. isoflurane. on the murine circadian clock. by analysing its effects on (a) behavioural locomotor rhythms and (b) PER2:: LUC expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the mouse brain. Behavioural phase shifts elicited by exposure of mice (n= 80) to six hours of GA (2% isoflurane) were determined by recording wheel-running rhythms in constant conditions (DD). Phase shifts in PER2:: LUC expression were determined by recording bioluminescence in organotypic SCN slices (n= 38) prior to and following GA exposure (2% isoflurane). Full phase response curves for the effects of GA on behaviour and PER2:: LUC rhythms were constructed. which show that the effects of GA are highly time-dependent. Shifts in SCN PER2 expression were much larger than those of behaviour (c. 0.7 h behaviour vs. 7.5 h PER2:: LUC).

1075801,The effect of general anaesthesia on the circadian clock of the honey bee (Apis mellifera): Persistence. mechanisms and treatment,2012,Nicola Ludin,,,,,,Post–operative sleep disruption is common among patients who undergo general anaesthesia. The reason for this can be partly attributed to a disruption of the circadian clock. It has been shown that a 6–hour isoflurane anaesthetic administered to the honey bee (Apis mellifera) under constant conditions during the subjective day time causes a phase delay of the circadian clock. or „jetlag‟. This phase shift in turn results in altered time perception following anaesthesia. By contrast. a 6–hour isoflurane anaesthesia is administered during the subjective night time. does not elicit a phase shift. The aims of this thesis were to: 1) determine whether the phase shifting effect of anaesthesia persists in the presence of daily light/ dark cycles in order to ascertain whether the effect is relevant to the normal environment under which patient receive anaesthesia 2) determine whether the phase delay can be eliminated with the concurrent administration of bright light 3) to accurately describe the time dependency of the effect of isoflurane on the clock. and compare this to the effect of light and 4) determine whether the phase shifting effect of isoflurane is due to anaesthesia or to exposure to a volatile chemical. Results from these experiments indicate that day time anaesthesia administered in the presence of strong light/ dark cycles elicits an average phase delay of –1.24 hours on the first post–anaesthetic day (compared with –3.5 hours under constant conditions) and that this shift is effectively removed by concurrent exposure to light and anaesthesia.,True,iHMw4_UAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/13305,,,,,0,0,0

Here. we used a combination of metabolite analysis and transcriptomics to analyse the response of the marine microalga Emiliania huxleyi as it acclimated to sulfate limitation. Lowering sulfate availability in artificial seawater from 25 to 5 mM resulted in significant reduction in growth and intracellular concentrations of dimethylsulfoniopropionate and glutathione.

On the other hand. with a concentration of 28 mM in today’s ocean. sulphate does not limit the growth of marine phytoplankton. Moreover. high sulphate abundance in seawater promotes the biosynthesis of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP). a unique sulphur compound with implications for plankton biology and ecology. environmental function and the global sulphur cycle. Unfortunately. little is known about the regulation of sulphate uptake and assimilation by marine phytoplankton species. In an effort to advance knowledge of metabolic sulphur pathways in the marine microalgae. this thesis aimed to investigate how sulphate availability regulates physiological. biochemical and molecular changes in the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi CCMP 1516. Algal cultures were subjected to artificial variations in ambient sulphur concentration and physiological and biochemical responses were assessed. Next. the global transcriptome response of E. huxleyi CCMP 1516 to limited sulphate supply was analysed by RNA sequencing.Cell abundance and intracellular DMSP concentration decreased with 5 mM sulphate compared to 25 mM controls.

1075824,Genotoxic evaluation of the Ergene River. Turkey. on mosquito fish. Gambussia affinis (Baird and Girard. 1853) using the piscine micronucleus assay,2016,Martin Orlinov Kanev and Kezban Özdemir and Fulya Dilek Gökalp,4,International Journal of Aquatic Biology,5,330-339,Iranian Society of Ichthyology,The Ergene River is located in the Thrace Region of Turkey and is polluted by industrial and municipal waste. In the present study. we investigated the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of water samples on Gambussia affinis in vivo using the piscine micronucleus (MN) test. Fish were exposed to 50. 100. 150 and 300 mL L-1 of water samples for 24 hrs. and MN. nuclear abnormalities (NA). polychromatic-normachromatic erythrocytes (PCEs/NCEs). and apoptotic erythrocytes were evaluated. In addition. water samples were analysed to determine the concentrations of the heavy metals. The results showed that MN. NA. and apoptosis frequencies significantly increase at all concentrations compared to the control. A significant correlation was found between genotoxicity endpoints and the concentration of water samples. The PCE-NCE ratio was significantly decreased at all treatments. The metal content of river water was not associated with the increase in the seasonal frequency of genotoxicity endpoints. The results indicated that the Ergene River has genotoxic and cytotoxic effects on erythrocytes of G. affinis in an in-vivo piscine MN test that could be due to organic and inorganic effluents.,True,r37yUEsAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,3,http://www.ij-aquaticbiology.com/index.php/ijab/article/view/171,9948575367987246857,/scholar?cites=9948575367987246857,,http://www.ij-aquaticbiology.com/index.php/ijab/article/download/171/311,0,0,0

Infants and young children have a high risk for developing iron deficiency (ID) because they have high demand for iron during the period of rapid growth. This is aggravated by the insufficiency of iron in their diet. Iron supplementation programs using pediatric tablets or drops have not been successful in the control of anemia amongst infants and children in some countries. “Sprinkles” is an innovative multi-micronutrient home fortification strategy to control iron deficiency and anemia to be more useful. Objective: The objective was to estimate the prevalence ID and IDA in infants and children in Ibb City. Yemen Republic; evaluate the use of a new form of iron and determine the hematologic response to different doses and forms of iron in Sprinkles and iron drops. Design: Using a prospective. randomized. controlled design. we studied 337 randomly children aged 24 - 48 months and infants aged 6 - 24 months in Ibb City (hemoglobin: 70 - 99 g/L). One group received a daily sachet of microencapsulated ferrous fumarate (80 mg elemental Fe) in powder form plus ascorbic acid to be sprinkled onto any complementary food eaten (sprinkles group); a control group received ferrous sulfate drops 3 times/d for 2 months (total dose: 40 mg elemental Fe). Hemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations were measured at baseline and at the end of treatment. Results: Successful treatment of anemia (hemoglobin > 100 g/L) occurred in 58% of the sprinkles group and in 56% of the drops group. with minimal side effects in both groups.

Ahmed,10,International Journal of Bioscience,5,398-404,INNSPUB,This study aimed to evaluate the association between serum sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and AGEs levels in type 2 diabetes patients with different stages of diabetic kidney disease. Eighty type 2 diabetes patients were divided into three groups: normoalbuminuric group. microalbuminuric group. and macroalbuminuric group. along with 20 age and sex-matched healthy individuals were included in the study. Fasting blood glucose. fasting insulin. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). renal function tests. lipid profile. serum Sirt1 (ELISA) and serum AGEs (ELISA) were evaluated. Comparing to the control group. serum Sirt1 level was significantly lowered in normoalbuminric patients (p< 0.05). While. serum level of AGEs was significantly increased in all diabetic patients (p< 0.001). Serum Sirt1 was negatively correlated with microalbumin in macroalbuminuric patients. Additionally. serum Sirt1 showed a positive correlation with insulin and AGEs levels in total diabetic patients (p< 0.05 and p< 0.001 respectively).

Many butterfly species may benefit from this kind of landscape. as very distinct microhabitats can be found in a very restricted spatial scale. To better understand how different microhabitats are related to fragmentation in rural landscapes the present study collected the butterfly fauna in 18 sampling point sites. representing distinct types of forest edges and forest interiors. Although closely located. these sites showed no spatial autocorrelation. Instead. a major distinction in species richness and composition was found among forest interior and edge habitats while no significant difference was found in species composition among distinct edge types. Therefore. the high segregation of butterfly assemblages found in a very restricted geographic scale suggests the presence of two different groups of butterflies that respond independently to forest fragmentation. the forest interior assemblages and forest edge assemblages. This distinction of butterfly assemblages related to forest interior and forest edges were already reported. but our results highlights that these differences are found mostly due to species turnover between those habitats. In other words. both microhabitat types present a high number of specialized species compared to a smaller fraction of generalist species that may occurs in both microhabitats. In the case of Atlantic Forest. the species of special conservation concern are those true specialized in forest interior habitats and not those specialized in forest …,True,wnzzx8IAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,3,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0031-10492019000100249&script=sci_arttext,2808976124511157224,/scholar?cites=2808976124511157224,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0031-10492019000100249&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

Pari Island is located in Kepulauan Seribu chain. As a tourist destination. the seagrass ecosystem at the island is constantly under pressure from time to time. An effort to prevent widespread damage is to designate parts of the coastline as a limited access research centre. Efforts to study seagrass ecosystem on Pari Island are ongoing. including studies on seagrass' ability to sequestrate carbon. This quantitative study was conducted in December 2014. Surveys are done on the abundance and density of seagrass in 122 plots (area= 50 Ã—50 cm2) which spread in 6 research stations. Biomass measurements were performed by extractive method on 4 types of seagrass (Cymodocea serrulata. Halophila ovalis. Halodule uninervis and Syringodium isoetifolium). The assessment of seagrass capability in storing carbon has been done by measuring the primary productivity of above ground and below ground. while the amount of carbon released is measured from littered leaves and the leaves eaten by herbivores. The findings show that there are 7 of 12 species of seagrass identified in Indonesia. ie Cymodoceae rotundata. Cymodoceae serrulata. Thalassia hemprichii. Enhalus acoroides. Syringodium isoetifolium. Halodule uninervis and Halophila ovalis. The dominant species is Thalassia hemprichii (density 200Â±153. 261Â±107 and 117Â±52 stands/m2) and Halodule uninervis (82Â±59 stands/m2).

This is the first report that provides insight in the saline resistance mechanism of a fresh water oleaginous microalgae.

In this study. several pathways are identified to be responsible for salt water adaptation of N. oleoabundans under both nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions. Proline and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle seem to be of importance for successful osmoregulation in N. oleoabundans. Genes involved in Proline biosynthesis were found to be upregulated in salt water. This was supported by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. which indicated an increase in proline content in the salt water nitrogen-replete condition.

1075899,Transcriptional landscapes of lipid producing microalgae,2019,Benoît M Carrères,,,,,,Microalgae are unicellular microscopic and photosynthetic organisms. They are found all over the planet and in all sorts of environments. Their role has been and is still very important for the planet. most notably that they are currently accounted for producing half of the atmospheric oxygen. While they used to be studied because of their capabilities to depollute water. the interests have shifted towards oleaginous microalgae and their high level of fatty-acids accumulation. Fatty-acids such as Triacylglycerides (TAG) are of particular interest for their easy chemical treatment to produce clean biodiesel. Even if microalgae have higher energy conversion efficiency than plants. do not need arable lands to grow on. and do not compete with feed production. the optimal conditions of production are still too costly to compete with fossil fuel pricing. To decrease production costs. growth conditions and the physiological efficiency of the microalgae needs to be optimized. This requires a deep understanding of the microalgae phenotype in the relevant growth conditions. A phenotype represents a set of behavioral traits of an organism In this thesis. the internal phenotype. the transcriptional landscape of two oleaginous microalgae species was studied using different growth conditions.

The purpose was to have participants with various backgrounds. As can be seen from the affiliations of the authors of this preprint. this goal has certainly be achieved. The didactic philosophy of the workshop was based on’learning by doing’. This has been achieved by form multidisciplinary groups which tackled carefully selected open problems from modern Life Sciences. Each team worked together during one week and was supervised by an experienced senior scientist. The groups started with identifying the relevant system parameters and continued with putting the problem under consideration in quantitative and predictive models. Important aspect of the workshop was that the participant were not only involved in the problem of his/her own group. During daily sessions. in which the teams reported their progress and strategies to each other. the participants learned from all modelling cases. This setup of actively involving young researchers in problem solving was supported by lectures in which techniques and concepts necessary to address modelling problems are presented.The motivation to organize this event stems from the following considerations. taken from the workshop proposal:“The 21st century is called the ‘Century of Life Sciences’. since it is expected that great breakthroughs in this field will be achieved in the coming decades. such as …,True,AUQWZYkAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://peerj.com/preprints/654/,,,,https://peerj.com/preprints/654v1.pdf,0,0,0

They arise at the flanks of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). and develop into lamina structures that exhibit adaxial/abaxial (upper/lower side of the leaf) polarity. At the molecular level. an intricate regulatory network determines ad-/abaxial polarity in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. where the Class III Homeodomain Leucine Zipper (HD-ZIPIII) and KANADI (KAN) proteins are key mediators. The HD-ZIPIII REVOLUTA (REV) is expressed in the adaxial domain of lateral organs. whereas KAN1 is involved in abaxial differentiation.

During last 10 years strawberry production in Poland ranged from 180 to 240 thous. t per year (source: FAO). In 2003 the area of strawberry plantations reached 39 thous. ha. In Lithuania yearly strawberry fruit production amounts 2.0-4.5 thous. t and the area of strawberry plantations in 2003 covered ca 1100 ha (source: FAO). More than 30 viruses and phytoplasmas affecting the genus Fragaria have been described so far (Mellor and Krczal 1987). Strawberry mottle virus (SMoV) is the most common virus of cultivated strawberries and it occurs wherever they are grown. It was found in Poland during inspection of strawberry plantations in 1965–1968 (Sobczykiewicz 1972). in 1989–1991 (Cieślińska and Zawadzka 1991). and in 2000–2002 (Cieślińska 2002. Babini et al. 2003). Numerous strains of SMoV infect strawberry plants symptomlessly. however. severe strains may cause a decline in vigour and reduce yield by up to 30%(Mellor and Krczal 1987). In the field. SMoV is transmitted by aphids Chaetosiphon sp. in a semi-persistent manner (Frazier and Sylvester 1960).

Schram and Stephen Jay Gould and their views and influence on the importance of paleontological data in evolutionary (historical) biology. Both scientists have consistently advocated the importance of the fossil record. but both have also perceptibly changed their views and approaches throughout their careers and in very different directions. Gould initially advocated a model-based approach to historical biology in an apparent attempt to increase the status of an endangered discipline in a difficult political and financial environment. Later. he largely redirected his focus away from these model-based approaches and instead emphasized the ‘contingency’perspective as of vital and overlooked importance in biological evolution. Schram only gradually moved from a ‘Mantonian’view on arthropod evolution into being a convinced ‘computer-based’cladist. but changed early enough to have immense influence on the development of phylogenetics of both arthropods and the Metazoa in general.

The focal point of this analysis is the repeated claims by paleontologists that the study of fossils gives their discipline a unique ‘historical dimension’ that makes it possible for them to unravel important aspects of evolution invisible to scientists who study the extant biosphere.

In this study. we investigated the inheritance pattern and chromatophores distribution/abundance of cobalt blue trouts obtained from a local fish farm. Based on crosses with wild-type and dominant yellow-albino lines. we could infer that cobalt blue are dominant over wild-type and co-dominant in relation to yellow-albino phenotype. resulting in a fourth phenotype: the white-albino. Analysis of chromatophores revealed that cobalt blue trouts present melanophores. as the wild-type. and a reduced number of xanthophores.

However. the mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study. we provide novel data demonstrating the stimulatory effects of cortisol on spermatogenesis using an ex vivo organ culture system.

In rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. aside from yellow-albino phenotypes. cobalt blue variants with autosomal. recessive inheritance have also been reported. In this study. we investigated the inheritance pattern and chromatophores distribution/abundance of cobalt blue trouts obtained from a local fish farm. Based on crosses with wild-type and dominant yellow-albino lines. we could infer that cobalt blue are dominant over wild-type and co-dominant in relation to yellow-albino phenotype. resulting in a fourth phenotype: the white-albino. Analysis of chromatophores revealed that cobalt blue trouts present melanophores. as the wild-type. and a reduced number of xanthophores. As regards to the white-albino phenotype. they were not only devoid of melanophores but also presented a reduced number of xanthophores. Cobalt blue and white-albino trouts also presented a more elongated body shape and. most remarkably. a smaller pituitary gland compared to wild-type and yellow-albino. suggesting that the allele for blue color is somehow linked with this abnormal pituitary phenotype.

1075975,Species richness patterns and functional traits of the bat fauna of arid southern Africa,2018,Ara Monadjem and Irene Conenna and Peter J Taylor and Corrie Schoeman,,HYSTRIX-the Italian Journal of Mammalogy,,,,The bat fauna of arid regions is still poorly studied mostly due to a lack of interest in areas with low species richness and a low number of threatened species. In this study. we reviewed the status of bat diversity in the arid parts of southern Africa. with the aim of setting up a baseline for future work. In particular. we described species richness patterns across four arid zones within the region (Namib Desert. Kalahari. Nama Karoo and Succulent Karoo). exploring abiotic gradients and local landscape structure. Additionally. we examined bat functional groups in this region and compared them with those of three other arid regions of the world to identify potential similarities and differences. The southern African arid region hosted 17 bat species. representing eight families. of which three are endemic to the region (Rhinolophus denti. Laephotis namibensis and Cistugo seabrae) and one is vagrant (the fruit bat Eidolon helvum). Species richness varied spatially within this arid region. being highest in the drier but topographically heterogeneous Namib Desert. probably as a result of roost availability. With regards to functional groups. the southern African arid region had few bat species adapted to foraging in open spaces. particularly when compared with the neighbouring savannahs. Drawing from this study. we suggest that: a) despite species richness decreasing with increasing aridity at the sub-continental scale. at a more local scale landscape features (e.g. habitat structure) might be more relevant than aridity in determining bat species richness; and b) an unknown factor. possibly patterns of temperature limiting the availability of insects flying high …,True,C20wiIAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,7,https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/278430,292844291553846696,/scholar?cites=292844291553846696,,https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/278430/Species_richness_patterns.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Yet. our understanding of their spatio-temporal dynamics in habitat use associated with the seasonal oscillation of resources is still limited. In this study. we have employed state-of-the-art lightweight GPS loggers to track the yellow-winged bat Lavia frons in a desert in northern Kenya to investigate how seasonality in a desert affects the a) spatial and b) temporal dimensions of movements in a low-mobility bat. Bats were tracked during April–May 2017 (rainy season) and January–February 2018 (dry season) using 1-g GPS loggers. Spatial and temporal dimensions of movements were quantified. respectively. as the home range and nightly activity patterns. We tested for differences between seasons to assess responses to seasonal drought. In addition. we quantified home range overlap between neighbouring individuals to investigate whether tracking data will be in accordance with previous reports on territoriality and social monogamy in L. frons. We obtained data for 22 bats. 13 during the rainy and 9 during the dry season. Home ranges averaged 5.46 ± 11.04 ha and bats travelled a minimum distance of 99.69 ± 123.42 m/hour. During the dry season. home ranges were larger than in the rainy season. and bats exhibited high activity during most of the night. No apparent association with free water was identified during the dry season.

In order to uncover possible interactive effects of climate and landscape structure on this species. we tested whether temperature and precipitation affect Goshawk reproductive performance differentially in closed (i.e. forest) or open (mainly forest–farmland mosaics) habitats. accounting for land cover at different distances from nests (250. 500. 1000 and 2500 m).

This is also due to limited funding targeting these species since such projects retain relatively high risk of failure connected with field challenges and difficulties in locating the species. However. Data Deficient species are also claimed to be on average more threatened than fully assessed ones[2.3].

An important feature of this family is the presence of several copies of the structural domain. the number of which is determined in a strictly limited range from one to six. Despite the strong tendency for the aggregation of several amyloidogenic regions in the family of the ribosomal S1 proteins. their fibril formation process is still poorly understood. Here. we combined computational and experimental approaches for studying some features of the amyloidogenic regions in this protein family. The FoldAmyloid. Waltz. PASTA 2.0 and Aggrescan programs were used to assess the amyloidogenic propensities in the ribosomal S1 proteins and to identify such regions in various structural domains. The thioflavin T fluorescence assay and electron microscopy were used to check the chosen amyloidogenic peptides’ ability to form fibrils. The bioinformatics tools were used to study the amyloidogenic propensities in 1331 ribosomal S1 proteins. We found that amyloidogenicity decreases with increasing sizes of proteins.

Resistance to anthracnose is not absolute in character. as the plants with high resistance can be affected by the pathogen but in less extent than those non-resistant. Recent suggestions of the total number of genes involved in control of anthracnose tolerance are discrepant. Current approach in breeding anthracnose-tolerant lupine is based on combination of non-allele genes of resistance in a single genotype. Specific DNA markers are being developed which are linked to the genes of resistance and can be used for rapid and effective selection of resistant plants. but prior to their application the efficacy of DNA marker should be specifically tested with the breeding material of interest to avoid false positive responces. The AnSeq3 and AnSeq4 DAN markers flanking Lanr1 gene at 0.9 cM distance are considered the closest to it (H. Yang et al.. 2012).

1076001,Frontispiece: Supramolecular Assembly of Peptide and Metallopeptide Gelators and Their Stimuli‐Responsive Properties in Biomedical Applications,2018,Natashya Falcone and Heinz‐Bernhard Kraatz,24,Chemistry–A European Journal,54,,,A fascinating class of soft materials are supramolecular gels which have attracted significant attention in recent years. They are composed of small molecule gelators that assemble into supramolecular network structures. Some gel materials are able to respond to various stimuli making them attractive drug delivery vehicles and as matrices for tissue regeneration. Peptide‐based gel materials are particularly attractive as they possess numerous advantages including biocompatibility and biodegradability. Stimuli‐responsive peptides that alter properties as a function of pH. redox. temperature. and enzymes offer the potential to create materials with tunable characteristics. Herein. the stimuli‐responsive properties (pH. redox. temperature. and enzyme responsive properties). as well as the biocompatible/‐degradable nature of the peptide gelators are highlighted. for more details. see the Minireview by H.‐B.

1076023,Economic Individualism and Cross-National Differences in Redistribution,2010,Gizem Arikan,,,,,,Redistributive policies and public support for redistribution vary greatly across countries. Although a large literature on the factors that influence the cross-national variation in redistribution has accumulated. behavioral factors such as cultural influences have received limited attention. In this dissertation. I address the effect of the political culture of economic individualism and shared subjective beliefs regarding the role of government on cross-national differences in the size of government. relative generosity of welfare policies. and support for redistribution. I show that a political culture that emphasizes the values of individual autonomy. self-reliance. pursuit of self-interest and achievement generates stronger support for capitalism and deter the development of strong redistributive policies. On the other hand. rather than being direct. cultural variables' effect on redistributive policy is indirect. and is mediated by existing institutions such as the electoral system and government type. In addition. the effect of political culture is not restricted to redistributive spending at the national level. Shared cultural values of economic individualism. by influencing the context within which political debates take place. the way political issues are framed and limiting the range of options available to societies also affects individual policy preferences. thus creating a cross-national heterogeneity in attitudes towards redistributive policies. Taking the cultural context into account improves our understanding of cross-national variation in both redistributive policies and support for such policies. thus pointing to the often-ignored link between mass attitudes and policy outcomes …,True,TAun6pwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,4,https://ir.stonybrook.edu/xmlui/handle/11401/70935,14967160676572977945,/scholar?cites=14967160676572977945,,https://ir.stonybrook.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11401/70935/Arikan_grad.sunysb_0771E_10097.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

One such coral. which has been seriously impacted by these stressors. is the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis. To reduce the effects of such stressors. this coral utilizes fluorescent proteins (FPs) and melanin (M).

It is known that MD cells have much lower basolateral Na+/K+ATPase activity than neighboring cortical thick ascending limb (cTAL) cells. Also. an increase in luminal [NaCl] leads to the depolarization of the MD cell basolateral membrane. an event thought to be an essential step in the TGF response. To study the role of the Na+ pump in MD cells. we created a mathematical model that includes kinetic and thermodynamic models of the transport proteins and channels in MD cells.

The LC50 of lavender oil were 24.56. 17.27 and 15.31 ml/L after exposure periods of 24. 48. and 72 hr respectively. The obtain results indicated that the essential oil exhibited a great potential acaricidal effect against two-spotted spider mite at different concentrations that are not phytotoxic to the host plant. Laboratory bioassay results indicated that the essential oil caused high fumigant and repellent activities against T. urticae.

The ability of β-aminobutyric acid (BABA) and green tea extract (GTE) to induce resistance in lime (Citrus aurantifolia) plants against Xanthomonas citri subsp. Citri (Xcc) was investigated. Green house experiments showed that BABA (250 ppm) and GTE {5%(w/v)} treatment protects lime plants against Xcc. Lime plants treated with BABA. green tea extract (Camellia sinensis). copper oxychloride and distilled water were inoulated with Xcc. Lesion expansion of inoculated leaves were evaluated 5. 10 and 20 days after treatment. The results showed that BABA and GTE had inhibitory effects on disease development. Base on previous experiments. none of the applied agents for plant treatment had direct antimicrobial activity on Xcc. except copper oxychloride. This indicated that the inhibitory effects of BABA and GTE was as a result of strengthening the defense capacities of the plant.

One of the potential reaction of plants to pathogens attack is an increased levels of pathogenesis-related proteins such as chitinase and β - 1.3 -glucanase. The objective of present study was to investigate the expression of the PR proteins; β-1.3-glucanase and chitinase in Washington Navel orange (Citrus sinensis) inoculated with Xanthomonas citri sub sp.citri. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the mRNA level of chitinase and ß- 1.3 -glucanase genes in early stage of plant defense response. For this purpose. total RNA was extracted from inoculated and non inoculated citrus plants at different times post-inoculation. Higher amounts of transcripts were detected 24 hours after pathogen inoculation of citrus leaves and four-fold more than the control citrus plant. The transcript levels of the two genes were reduced with the time after inoculation. and decreased significantly at 96 hours post inoculation.

Kosovo is one of the least investigated countries of the Balkan Peninsula in regard to fish fauna. In this study. we present the results of a fish fauna investigation in Badovc Lake and the Llap River. The fish fauna of Badovc Lake in central Kosovo was investigated at monthly intervals between June 2012 and December 2012. A total of 16 species belonging to 6 families. Cyprinidae. Cobitidae. Percidae. Siluridae. Esocidae. and Centrarhidae. were determined in this research area. The vast majority of species found belong to the family Cyprinidae (11). while all other families are represented by a single species. At 10 selected stations of the Llap River. 12 fish species were found. The family Cyprinidae is represented by 10 species. while 2 other families (Percidae and Salmonidae) are represented by a single species.

During this time we follow up the impact of environmental factors on the dynamics of the fish population. The electrofishing is used as sampling method. This is particularly useful method because other techniques such as netting. were ineffective due to nature of habitat. The sites were fished by wading using back–up electrofishing equipment (Hans Grassl GmbH). Research was done and the fish specimens were collected in six separate sites along the river longitudinal profile (source. middle course and mouth). The results from one year research period in Drenica river show that the composition of fish fauna is very complex.

1076106,HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH POLLUTANTS FROM COAL MINING AND COMBUSTION IN THE VICINITY OF SCHOOLS,2013,Adejoke C Olufemi and Andile Mji and Murembiwa S Mukhola,,READINGS BOOK,,968,,Coal mining activities have been reported as one of the causes of environmental pollution in many nations of the world and have also resulted in various adverse health effects. This study aimed at assessing the levels of pollutants in air and drinking water and how they may affect the health of school learners in the vicinity of coal mines in the town of eMalahleni. Mpumalanga province of South Africa. For air pollutants. samples were collected from both inside and outside the classrooms in five different schools. This was done by using Radiello® samplers to determine the presence of Sulphur dioxide (SO2). Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Ozone (O3) and filter pumps to determine the presence of Lead (Pb). Water samples were taken from drinking tap of two of the five selected secondary schools in this town to determine the presence of Lead (Pb). Nickel (Ni). Arsenic (As) and Mercury (Hg). All these parameters for both air and water were analyzed using different analytical methods. The results were compared with the recommended guidelines by South African National Standard (SANS). The result of air analysis revealed that the pollutants SO2. NO2. O3 and Pb were present in vicinity of schools at various levels. The result for water indicated that most of the tested parameters in the tap water from the schools were at acceptable levels with the exception of lead (Pb) which was found to be at the threshold limit of SANS recommendation for drinking water. The presence of some of these pollutants at significant levels should be a cause for concern.

1076107,Assessment of Physicochemical and Microbiological Parameters of Drinking Water Samples from a South African Coal Mining Area,,Adejoke C Olufemi and Andile Mji and Murembiwa S Mukhola,,,,,,Globally. water pollution is a critical problem which is inflicting serious damage on human health and the natural environment. In South Africa. many cases of water pollution have been reported. This paper assesed the physical. chemical and microbial properties of water from three locations in a coal mining region of South Africa. A mixed-methods approach involving quantitative analysis of water and qualitative (interviews of participants) was empoyed. Samples were taken from two secondary schools taps and a river. A total number of eleven parameters were assessed and analysed using different analytical methods. The values of each of analyzed parameters were later compared with the South African National Standard (SANS) for drinking water quality. The findings reveal that majority of the parameters conformed to the recommended guidelines while others were either at the threshold limit or present in greater concentrations. It is to be noted that long-term exposure of any of these in water can result in a number of harmful effects as discussed in the paper.,True,Gi3pO-8AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10842829909376062023&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The RS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs were modified with octadecylamine (ODA) as an organic modifier. The prepared NCs were characterized by using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The XRD results showed that as the intensity of the peaks decreased with the increase of ORS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs content in comparison with PCL peaks. the Fe 3 O 4-NPs peaks increased from 1.0 to 60.0 wt.%. The TEM and SEM results showed a good dispersion of ORS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs in the PCL matrix and the spherical shape of the NPs. The TGA analysis indicated thermal stability of ORS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs increased after incorporation with PCL but the thermal stability of ORS/Fe 3 O 4/PCL-NCs decreased with the increase of ORS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs content. Tensile strength was improved with the addition of 5.0 wt.% of ORS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs. The antibacterial activities of the ORS/Fe 3 O 4/PCL-NC films were examined against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) by diffusion method using nutrient agar. The results indicated that ORS/Fe 3 O 4/PCL-NC films possessed a strong antibacterial activity with the increase in the percentage of ORS/Fe 3 O 4-NCs in the PCL.

Diet plays a vital role in the etiology of cancer. This research was carried out to study the chemopreventive properties of germinated rough rice (GRR) crude extract in Sprague-Dawley rats induced with azoxymethane. Germination of rough rice causes significant changes in several chemical compositions of presently bioactive compounds. These compounds may prevent or postpone the inception of cancer. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 weeks of age) were randomly divided into 5 groups which were (G1) induced with azoxymethane (AOM) and not given GRR (positive control). (G2) induced with AOM and given 2000 mg/kg GRR. (G3) induced with AOM and given 1000 mg/kg GRR. (G4) induced with AOM and given 500 mg/kg GRR. and (G5) not induced with AOM and not given GRR crude extract (negative control). To induce colon cancer. rats received two IP injections of AOM in saline (15 mg/kg) for two subsequent weeks. Organs were removed and weighed. Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were evaluated histopathologically. -Catenin expressions were determined by Western blot. Treatment with 2000 mg/kg GRR crude extract not only resulted in the greatest reduction in the size and number of ACF but also displayed the highest percentage of nondysplastic ACF. Treatment with 2000 mg/kg GRR also gave the lowest level of expression in β-catenin. Thus. GRR could be a promising dietary supplement for prevention of CRC.,True,sQGAlAsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,8,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2017/9517287/abs/,6945541512400273159,/scholar?cites=6945541512400273159,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2017/9517287/abs/,0,0,0

Ag-NPs were synthesized on the surface of rice straw (RS) with various percentages of Ag-NPs (1.0. 5.0. 10.0. and 20.0 wt.%) under different temperatures and diverse pH values. The ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy of synthesized RS/Ag-NCs became noticeable with increased pH. and the peaks were blue-shifted to lower wavelengths. X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) demonstrated the presence of pure Ag-NPs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the diameters of Ag-NPs on RS were between 7.78 and 2.84 nm at pH values of 8 to 10. The antibacterial activity of various sizes of Ag-NPs on RS was examined using Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) based on the well diffusion technique. Higher antibacterial activity was detected as the loading percentage of RS/Ag-NCs increased and particle size decreased. The superior catalytic performance of 20.0 wt.% RS/Ag-NCs was considered in a test reaction in 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction in the presence of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in an eco-friendly solvent at ambient temperature.

This vegetable is rich in minerals and human health-benefiting compounds. and thus long-term consumption of tomato fruits facilitates to reduce the incidences of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer. Therefore. developing strategies to improve the tomato production should have great potential applications and significance in human health. Numerous studies have provided evidences that nutrition management is a key agronomic strategy to improve the yield and nutritional quality of vegetables. Accordingly. previous studies have investigated the effects of application of nitrogen (N) or potassium (K) alone on the yield and the quality of tomato fruits in hydroponics systems. However. the effects of combined application of the above two nutrients still remain largely unknown up to now. Furthermore. conventional hydroponic cultivation often results in oxygen deficiency of roots which would cause anoxia of the roots. Aeroponics is a system of advanced soilless culture technologies. It not only avoids the oxygen deficiency of roots. but also can efficiently meet the nutrient requirement of crops. The objective of this study was to investigate the combined effects of N and K on the yield and nutritional quality of tomato fruits in aeroponic cultivation. Two tomato cultivars. dwarf-red (D-red) and dwarf-yellow (D-yellow). were used three levels of N (2. 12. 22 mmol/L) and two levels of K (4. 8 mmol/L) were applied to the plants.

They invade lowland ricefields by having intermediate phenotypes between rice cultivars and its wild type. They grow sympatrically with the cultivars and compete effectively with the crop that often result to excessive yield loss. but un-fortunately this pest is difficult to control due to phenotypic resemblance and close genetic relationships with the rice cultivars. The high variability of weedy rice phenotype in the field is suggestive also that it reflect phenotypic relationships to its wild ancestors. In the current study. we explore the phenotypic affinity of weedy rice in the Philippine archipelago using seed shape. The shape is known to have large genetic bases and so its utility in the study is reliable. Using the Geometric Morphometric (GM) tool specifically elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) and Multivariate Analysis in statistics. we found that 64% of the weedy rice in the archipelago has phenotypic affinity to 13 wild landraces (AA genome) collected from 15 different locations within West Africa. Carribean Islands. Latin America. India. Australia. South Asia and Southeast Asia. Ten populations have affinity to O. meyeriana (GG genome) in the Philippines and Malaysia. Both weedy populations from Misamis Oriental. Philippines (WRMIS1) and Nueva Ecija. Philippines (WRNE2) have affinity to PsBRc 64 and PSBRc 82. respectively while two populations from Iloilo. Philippines (WRILO1 & WRILO2) have affinity to O. latifolia in Costa Rica. Overall results display a complex pattern of phenotypic affinity. thus suggesting multiple origins of weedy rices in the Philippines.© 2011 Friends Science Publishers,True,XZFJ05YAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4,https://www.academia.edu/download/30922416/3.pdf,4814009919426872730,/scholar?cites=4814009919426872730,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30922416/3.pdf,0,0,0

Principal Component Analysis effectively reduced the 12 variables into 3 component factors namely: PC 1 which is related to abundance of microbial contaminants has an eigenvalue of 2.54. hence declared as significantly different from the other variables; PC 2 pertains to phosphate loading with eigenvalue of 1.94 and PC 3 which is related to physical factors with eigenvalue of 1.16. Scatter plot produced from PCA revealed that the entire study area was generally uniform in characteristics. Based on PC 1. the seawater quality of the stressed coastal zone was characterized generally as poor. and therefore not safe for recreational and fishing activities.,True,XZFJ05YAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,http://aes.bioflux.com.ro/docs/2014.7-16.pdf,18207161862516382043,/scholar?cites=18207161862516382043,,http://aes.bioflux.com.ro/docs/2014.7-16.pdf,0,0,0

The concept provides for a rationale on the observation that certain subsets of phenotypic traits show particularly high levels of association over development and/or evolution. The rice seed consists of morphological parts that can be argued to be a good model for modularity and integration analysis thus this study was conducted. Patterns of phenotypic integration and modularity in the mature seeds of weedy rice using the Modularity and Integration Analysis Tool (MINT) ver. 1.0 b were used in this investigation. A total of 8 variational modularity models in the shape data were tested using the γ·(Gamma·) test for goodness of fit (GoF) statistics.

Principal component and parsimony analyses were used to describe variations and groupings in collected earthworm individuals. Of the five groups of earthworms determined and described. one group was found to be allochthonous and anthropochorous. Cladistic analysis yielded a strict consensus tree with a length of 253 steps. consistency index= 50 and retention index= 69. Four groups were identified to belong to Family Megascolecidae. and one group to Family Eudrilidae. Differences observed were attributed to the number and pattern of genital markings. prostomium type. and the number and location of spermathecae. None of the four new megascolecid groups completely match with the nearest genera of Oriental megascolecids.

These slides can be displayed to students via a data projector to accompany a lesson with text. video-clips. animation and audio (Holzl. 1997). PowerPoint was designed with business professionals in mind. but it was not long before its potential in education was revealed. It was hailed as the ‘OHP for the 21st century’. and has started to replace coloured slides and overheads at universities (Szabo and Hastings. 2000). Since then.

Although it is obviously impossible to show this directly by experiment. I have found that demonstrating the fluorescence of chlorophyll in an organic solvent can initiate a stimulating discussion.

1076150,Drawing light rays with a ruler,2008,Stephen Rowcliffe,89,School Science Review,328,30,ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION,Igneous rocks that form from rapidly cooling magma have smaller crystals than rocks formed from magma that cools slowly. For example. lava flowing into the sea cools very quickly and the crystals in solid lava are so small that they are not obvious. Other rocks such as gabbro. an intrusive igneous rock. are formed by cooling very slowly. maybe over thousands of years. allowing large crystals to form. The effect of cooling rate can be seen simply by observing closely any sweets that have a honeycomb structure. such as a Crunchie bar. Cutting a section (Figure 1) and using a hand lens allows students to see that bubbles formed near the edge (which cools first and therefore fastest) are smaller than bubbles near the centre (which cools last and therefore slowest).,True,dC67IdsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/36157080/RowcliffeA_SN.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

1076158,Evaluation of P16INK4A as a Biomarker in Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia,,Shilpa Kava and Shalini Rajaram and Vinod K Arora,,,,,,Introduction: Cervical screening would benefit from a test based on a disease-specific biomarker that identifies high grade lesions. which could also indicate the presence of early precancerous lesions that have a high risk of progression to cancer. One such potential biomarker is p16INK4A. Objective of the study was to study the biomarker p16INK4A expression by immunostaining in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Material and method: Experimental study conducted from November 2009 to April 2011. 1500 women were screened for cancer cervix using conventional Pap test. VIA and VILI. Women having positive results underwent colposcopy and biopsy if required. P16INK4A expression in biopsy samples was studied using immunohistochemistry. Results: All test positive cases n= 235. underwent colposcopy. Colposcopic abnormalities were detected in n= 83 and biopsy proven cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in n= 15. P16INK4A expression was seen in eight of 15 CIN cases. The strength of positivity of P16INK4A was higher in CIN 2 and CIN 3 cases as compared to CIN 1. Also. the pattern of staining differed among various grades of CIN.Conclusion: P16INK4A expression was seen in majority of CIN 2 and CIN 3 lesions suggesting a higher grade lesion as compared to CIN 1. The discrimination between the lesions can be made without having to depend on traditional histopathology which gives a static picture of pre-invasive lesions of the cervix. This can help in differentiating high grade lesions from the lower grades. thereby helping in appropriate management of the cases.,True,4Pm2KXEAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2672060032808849630&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

The genus Citrus possesses several undesirable characteristic including salt and cold sensitivity they are also susceptible to diseases caused by fungi. bacteria and viruses. Despit substantial genetic diversity and interspecific fertility. the genus Citrus includes some of the most difficult species to breeding. For example. most species are highly heterozygous and produce progeny that segregate widely for many characters when crosses are made. The juvenile periods are often very long. self-and cross-incompatibility and pollen and/or ovule sterility are relatively common. and the presence of adventitious somatic embryos in the nucellus of developing ovules of the most of Citrus greatly limits hybrid production. Genetic transformation is an alternative to overcome these difficulties. For successful transformation. regeneration of whole plants from the transformed cells is a prerequisite.

However. high relatedness can increase susceptibility to pathogens. a phenomenon known as the 9monoculture effect9. Here we examine if the benefits of living with relatives offsets the harm caused by pathogens. and if this depends if species typically live with kin. Using comparative meta-analysis across plants. animals and bacteria (nspecies=56). we show that high within-group relatedness increases mortality when pathogens are present. Contrastingly. mortality decreased with relatedness when pathogens were rare. particularly in species that live with kin. Variation in pathogen abundances was lower across groups of relatives. but rates of mortality were more unpredictable. The effects of within-group relatedness were only evident when pathogens were manipulated. suggesting that the harm caused by pathogens is masked by the benefits of living with relatives.

1076200,The monoculture effect: A meta-analysis and experiment on ostrich chicks,2017,Hanna Bensch,,,,,,The spread of pathogens between individuals has important effects on patterns of mortality. behaviour and the genetic structure of populations. One factor that is predicted to influence the transmission of pathogens is the genetic diversity of the host group. Groups of closely related individuals are susceptible to similar pathogens. and hence increase in genetic diversity of the group should decrease pathogen transmission between hosts. This has popularly been referred to as the ‘monoculture effect’ as a result of the increased risk of disease in agricultural crop monocultures. However. empirical studies have found evidence both for and against the monoculture effect. raising the question of whether it is simply an artefact of agriculture and therefore not applicable to natural populations. In this study. I investigate the strength and generality of the monoculture effect in a range of species. by conducting a meta-analysis of the relationship between within group genetic diversity and pathogen prevalence and/or mortality. In total. I found 33 relevant studies (on 20 species). and the meta-analysis showed a significant negative relationship between group genetic diversity and rates of host infection/mortality. confirming that the monoculture effect is a general phenomenon. One issue with the study of the monoculture effect highlighted by this analysis was that the majority of the studies were on insects and that more research is required on a broader range of taxa. I addressed this issue by conducting a study on juvenile ostriches.

To address this issue. the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop cost-effective methods for assembling the most accurate and complete reference genomes to date. Here we summarize these developments. introduce a set of quality standards. and present lessons learned from sequencing and assembling 16 species representing major vertebrate lineages (mammals. birds. reptiles. amphibians. teleost fishes and cartilaginous fishes). We confirm that long-read sequencing technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality and that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are major sources of error in assemblies. Our new assemblies identify and correct substantial errors in some of the best historical reference genomes.

The first section outlines the scientific work that I have accomplished during the last year of my graduate studies. The goal was to generate a reference genome for the European barn swallow (Hirundo rustica rustica). The barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) is a migratory bird that has been the focus of a large number of ecological. behavioural and genetic studies. To facilitate further population genetics and genomic studies. I have generated a high-quality genome for the European subspecies (Hirundo rustica rustica) using third-generation Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) DNA sequencing from Pacific Biosciences (Menlo Park. California. USA) and optical mapping from Bionano Genomics (San Diego. California. USA). For optical mapping. DNA molecules were labelled both with one of the original Nick. Label. Repair and Stain (NLRS) nickases (enzyme Nb.BssSI) and with the new Direct Label and Stain (DLS) approach (enzyme DLE-1). This allowed to compare and integrate optical maps derived both from NLRS and DLS technologies. The latter was officially released in February 2018 and avoids nicking and subsequent cleavage of DNA molecules upon staining. To my knowledge. this has been the first genome assembly to incorporate DLS data and this approach has more than doubled the assembly N50 with respect to the nickase system. Furthermore. the dual enzyme hybrid scaffold led to a marginal increase in scaffold N50 and an overall increase of confidence in scaffolds. After removal of haplotigs. the final assembly is approximately 1.21 Gbp in size. with a N50 value of over 25.95 Mbp.

To obtain information on Htt orthologous genes. a potential source of genomic DNA is represented by museum collections. Here we aimed at the characterization of orthologous sequences of the human microsatellite by assessing 114 specimens from Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano. Museo di Storia Naturale di Pavia and Acquario Civico di Milano. Samples belonged to four vertebrate groups: mammals (n= 39). amphibians (n= 1). fishes (n= 22) and reptiles (n= 52). Small fragments of tissues preserved in ethanol (n= 52). stored frozen (n= 79) and tissues that had undergone a tanning process (n= 10) were used.

DNA extraction yielded fragments of highly variable length. probably depending on initial sample preservation conditions. Specific primers designed to encompass the CAG tract and targeting the most conservative regions of the different templates were used to amplify the sequences of interest.

The CAG then appeared in. and is unique to. the deuterostome branch. Two CAGs are found in Hdh in sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). the first species to carry a primitive nervous system. and two CAGs are present in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae). the first species to exhibit a rudimental hollow nerve tube and cephalization. Four CAGs are found in Hdh from the more evolved fishes. amphibians and birds. The CAG further expands in mammals and reaches its maximum length in humans. In Homo sapiens the Hdh gene is located in the short arm of chromosome 4 and is characterized by a CAG sequence repeated 9–35 times. Normal subjects have revealed an increase in grey matter with increasing length of the CAG repeat. indicating that CAG size can influence normal brain structure. However. CAG repeats exceeding 35 in number cause Huntington’s disease. a neurodegenerative syndrome that occurs earlier due to a greater number of CAG repeats. Our hypothesis is that the progressive increase in CAG length in the Hdh gene observed during evolution may be implicated in the evolutionary changes that have occurred in developing adult nervous systems throughout vertebrate phylogeny. with a possible role for the CAG in newly emerging cognitive functions in the mammalian brain. We have collected genomic DNA and have begun to amplify the CAG tract from primates (Nycticebus pygmaeus. Eulemur fulvus albifrons. Lemur variegatus.

This technique is proven to be able to increase extraction efficiency. shorten extraction time and maintain the activity of antioxidants especially polyphenols. Liquid state of the antioxidant mixture after extraction reduces the application of extracts containing bioactive compounds. This is due to the rapid decline in activity over time and higher transport costs for the liquid extracts with a large amount of water. Therefore. this study was focused on extraction process assisted by microwave to obtain the guava extracts and capsulated these extracts by the suitable carrier to remain the polyphenol activity. It could be seen that microwave was a potential method to extract the polyphenols in comparison with solid-liquid extraction. The cell structure of plant materials was significantly destroyed by microwave in order to release more polyphenols from inner parts of guava leaves. The total phenolic and flavonoid content were increased 12.7% and 36.5% when microwave applied in comparison with the solid-liquid extraction.

1076226,Impact of Climate Change on Foodborne Diseases,2015,Dam Sao Mai and Nguyen Khanh Hoang,,Foodborne Pathogens and Food Safety,,162,CRC Press,There are three sectors of the triad (hosts. microbes. and environment) which climate impacts (Fig. 1). The climate change has a dramatic effect on infectious disease and on the transmission of food and waterborne diseases that comes from a number of sources (eg. the seasonality of foodborne and diarrheal disease). changes in disease patterns that occur as a consequence of temperature. and associations between increased incidence of food and waterborne illness and severe weather events (Hall et al.. 2002; Rose et al.. 2001). The predictable food and waterborne diseases of the developing countries (eg. bacillary dysentery. cholera) are less frequent in developed countries. due to stringent public health measures such as proper sewage disposal. clean water and hygiene.There are theoretical and unintended consequences of global climate change on food safety. Climatic factors influence the growth and survival of pathogens. as well as transmission pathways (Vladimir and Dragan. 2012). Higher ambient temperatures increase replication cycles of foodborne pathogens. and prolonged seasons may augment the opportunity for food handling mistakes—in 32% of investigated foodborne outbreaks in Europe “temperature misuse” is considered a contributing factor (Tirado and Schmidt. 2001).,True,2ysuGysAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=2ZPwCgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA162&dq=info:EOvrrt_OVnAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=XWMUdGldkT&sig=-wBjSa9_DY4U7_2j-ODIfrVLsGU,,,,,0,0,0

They are critical in diverse cellular functions. acting as scaffolds for protein recruitment and as diffusion barriers for subcellular compartmentalization. Human septins are encoded by 13 different genes and are classified into four groups based on sequence homology (SEPT2. SEPT3. SEPT6. and SEPT7 groups). In yeast. septins were among the first proteins reported to be modified by SUMOylation. a ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification. However. whether human septins could be modified by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) and what roles this modification may have in septin function remains unknown. In this study. we first show that septins from all four human septin groups can be covalently modified by SUMOs.

Dietary strategies represent one among different therapeutic approaches employed to ameliorate. treat or prevent the obesity epidemic. In this thesis. we focused on bovine whey protein. selected for their ability to influence energy balance. satiety hormones production and glucose tolerance. In particular. using male C57BL/6 mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). we investigated the effect of whey protein isolate (WPI) and the whey protein component alpha-lactalbumin (LAB) on body weight. adipose tissue. intestinal-related functions and gut microbiota. LAB given with HFD increased energy intake without affecting body weight. We observed that this energy mismatch was. in part. due to a change in the gene expression of nutrient transporters within the small intestine. This was accompanied by an increase in relative abundance of Parabacteroides. Bifidobacterium. Parvibacter and Lactobacillus in the gut. We next investigated the effect of HFD supplemented with WPI given at two different ages and with different WPI intake durations. We observed that. only in younger mice. WPI decreased body weight and adiposity. which might be caused by an increase of adipose tissue catabolism. In addition. the gut microbiota of younger mice fed with HFD-WPI showed a different gut microbiota composition. including an increased relative abundance of Lactobacillus murinus.

1076242,Antiproliferative Effects of Ferula assa-foetida’s Extract on PC12 and MCF7 Cancer Cells,2020,Mina Abroudi and Amir Ganji Fard and Ghazaleh Dadashizadeh and Omid Gholami and Davood Mahdian,6,International Journal of Biomedical Engineering and Clinical Science,3,60,Science Publishing Group,Background: Ferula assa-foetida is a herbaceous plant of the Umbelliferae family having a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antiseptic. antibacterial. anti-inflammation. and. anti-tumor activity against a wide range of cancers. Among these features. antitumor activity has become more important in recent years and it still demands more investigations to address the underlying mechanisms. Purpose: This current study was conducted to evaluate the anti-proliferative effect of Ferula assa-foetida on PC12 and MCF7 cells as well as examining its mechanisms. Materials and Methods: Cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. 100 units/ml penicillin. and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells incubated with different concentrations of the ethanolic extract of Ferula assa-foetida. Notably. cytotoxicity and apoptosis assay were measured by MTT and PI staining. respectively. Results: The MTT results showed that the ethanolic extract of Ferula assa-foetida in concentrations of 10. 7. 5. and 2.5 µM on both PC12 and MCF7 cells had a significant effect in cell viability and apoptosis induction in comparison to control group. Conclusion: In this study. it was determined that Ferula assafetida through the induction of apoptosis prevented the growth of PC12 and MCF7 cells and made a reduction in cell viability with different concentrations in a time-and dose-dependent manner. However. more studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms of Ferula assa-foetida’s extract in apoptosis induction.,True,RYnJn5MAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Omid_Gholami3/publication/345578672_Antiproliferative_Effects_of_Ferula_assa-foetida's_Extract_on_PC12_and_MCF7_Cancer_Cells/links/5fa8df63458515157bf726f1/Antiproliferative-Effects-of-Ferula-assa-foetidas-Extract-on-PC12-and-MCF7-Cancer-Cells.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Omid_Gholami3/publication/345578672_Antiproliferative_Effects_of_Ferula_assa-foetida's_Extract_on_PC12_and_MCF7_Cancer_Cells/links/5fa8df63458515157bf726f1/Antiproliferative-Effects-of-Ferula-assa-foetidas-Extract-on-PC12-and-MCF7-Cancer-Cells.pdf,0,0,0

Bayesian models have been proposed to face this challenge. Indeed. Bayesian inference is a way to do optimal reasoning when only uncertain and incomplete information is available. Various perceptive. sensory-motor. and cognitive functions have been successfully modeled this way. However. the biological mechanisms allowing animals and humans to represent and to compute probability distributions are not known.

1076261,Toward biochemical probabilistic computation,2015,Jacques Droulez and David Colliaux and Audrey Houillon and Pierre Bessière,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.02623,,,,Living organisms survive and multiply even though they have uncertain and incomplete information about their environment and imperfect models to predict the consequences of their actions. Bayesian models have been proposed to face this challenge. Indeed. Bayesian inference is a way to do optimal reasoning when only uncertain and incomplete information is available. Various perceptive. sensory-motor. and cognitive functions have been successfully modeled this way. However. the biological mechanisms allowing animals and humans to represent and to compute probability distributions are not known. It has been proposed that neurons and assemblies of neurons could be the appropriate scale to search for clues to probabilistic reasoning. In contrast. in this paper. we propose that interacting populations of macromolecules and diffusible messengers can perform probabilistic computation.

1076264,Bringing phenotyping to the farm: An evaluation of 3D reconstruction of plants in outdoor environment,2017,David Colliaux and T Wintz and P Hanappe,,,,,Communication présentée à l’International Conference on Computer Vision. Venise. Italie,Recent reviews have pointed out that data collection and trait extraction is the major bottleneck in plant phenotyping. Several platforms. like PhenoTiki [3]. provides Open Source components for an affordable acquisition of plant images. Recent years also emphasized the importance of 3d geometric features to characterize the morphology of plants [1]. We describe the hardware and software components for the acquisition of 3d images and a precise analysis of the plant morphology. The platform distinguishes itself from existing work in that it is designed as an affordable and modular solution that can be used both in the lab and in the field. in either static or mobile configuration. In addition. the plant images are captured with an off-the-shelf camera that combines color from an RGB sensor with depth information from a time-of-flight (TOF) sensor (DepthSense by SoftKinetic).To reach parts of plants that are occluded in a single view. the camera is mounted on a mobile 5 DOF arm (3 translations and pan/tilt rotations) and several views (typically 100) on a circular path are combined to get a full reconstruction of the plant. An iterative closest point algorithm is used to align clouds taken from nearby poses.

Although influenza virus vaccines are available and each year manufactures modify the vaccine depending on the expected mutated strain. it is still far from satisfactory. mainly in young children and older adults. Therefore. a product that can support and shape the immune system to protect against viral flu infections is highly essential. Methods: A functional food water-soluble mixture of pomegranate. red grape. dates. olive fruit. figs. and ginger extracts. termed herein “Protector”. was prepared and tested in stimulating/modulating the production of specific cytokines. and hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibodies following viral flu vaccination in mice. Results: A single intraperitoneal or multiple oral administration for 1–7 days of “Protector” significantly increased the production of interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-12 in blood. spleen. and lungs of mice. When “Protector” was orally administered for one week following a single vaccine injection (primary immunization) or for two weeks (one week apart) following double vaccine injections (secondary immunization). mice significantly produced higher titers of HAI antibodies.

1076307,Comparisons of the genome of SARS-CoV-2 and those of other betacoronaviruses,2020,Eduardo Rodríguez-Román and Adrian J Gibbs,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,The genome of SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 is most closely related to viral metagenomes isolated from bats and. more distantly. pangolins.  All are of sarbecoviruses of the genus Betacoronavirus.  We have unravelled their recombinational and mutational histories.  All showed clear evidence of recombination. most events involving the 39 half of the genomes.  The 59 region of their genomes was mostly recombinant free. and a phylogeny calculated from this region confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 is closer to RmYN02 than RaTG13. and showed that SARS-CoV-2 diverged from RmYN02 at least 26 years ago. and both diverged from RaTG13 at least 37 years ago; recombinant regions specific to these three viruses provided no additional information as they matched no other Genbank sequences closely.  Simple pairwise comparisons of genomes show that there are three regions where most non-synonymous changes probably occurred; the DUF3655 region of the nsp3. the S gene and ORF 8 gene.  Differences in the last two of those regions have probably resulted from recombinational changes. however differences in the DUF3655 region may have resulted from selection.  A hexamer of the proteins encoded by the nsp3 region may form the molecular pore spanning the double membrane of the coronavirus replication organelle (Wolff et al.. 2020). and perhaps the acidic polypeptide encoded by DUF3655 lines it. and presents a novel target for pharmaceutical intervention.,True,9RgsRL4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.12.199521v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/13/2020.07.12.199521.full.pdf,0,0,0

The coral-associated microbial community varies substantially between tissue and mucus microhabitats; however. the factors controlling the occurrence. abundance. and distribution of microbial taxa over time have rarely been explored for different coral compartments simultaneously. Here. we test (1) differentiation in microbiome diversity and composition between coral compartments (surface mucus and tissue) of two Acropora hosts (A. tenuis and A. millepora) common along inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef. as well as (2) the potential linkage between shifts in individual coral microbiome families and underlying host and environmental parameters.

1076346,Coupling shifts in the composition of coral tissue-and mucusassociated microbial communities to changes in coral host physiology and environmental fluctuations,2019,Giulia Manso Marchioro,,,,,,Understanding the drivers of microbiome variation in corals is crucial to better predict the effects of environmental pressures on coral holobionts and coral reef ecosystems. However. much remains to be understood about corals and the interactions they establish with microorganisms. My hypothesis is that the microbiome of the surface mucus layer (SML) is mainly influenced by environmental parameters due to its direct contact with the environment. whereas the tissue microbiome is more driven by the physiology of the coral host. Therefore. the aim of the present work is to distinguish the effect of the host’s intrinsic and environmental factors on the microbiome composition in different coral compartments (SML and tissue). and to identify possible overarching trends in the environmental sensitivity of distinct microbiomes within a coral holobiont. Using next-generation amplicon-sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. the analyses showed that microbiomes of Acropora spp. differed significantly between compartments (SML versus tissue) and species (A. tenuis versus A. millepora). but also among sampling location and season. Seawater samples were characterized by dominance of members of the Synechococcaceae and Pelagibacteraceae. In Acropora spp.. mucus microbiome was dominated by members of Flavobacteriaceae.

The pathway activity is essential for both intestinal homeostasis and tumorigenesis. To date. several mouse models and cellular systems have been used to analyze TCF4 function. However. some findings were conflicting. especially those that were related to the defects observed in the mouse gastrointestinal tract after Tcf4 gene deletion. or to a potential tumor suppressive role of the gene in intestinal cancer cells or tumors. Here. we present the results obtained using a newly generated conditional Tcf4 allele that allows inactivation of all potential Tcf4 isoforms in the mouse tissue or small intestinal and colon organoids. We also employed the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system to disrupt the TCF4 gene in human cells. We showed that in adult mice. epithelial expression of Tcf4 is indispensable for cell proliferation and tumor initiation. However. in human cells. the TCF4 role is redundant with the related T-cell factor 1 (TCF1) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) transcription factors.

1076391,Neurological Effects Of A Single Low Level Blast Overpressure Exposure: Behavior And Micro RNA Mechanisms Of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury In A Rodent Model,2015,Dorothy L Dobbins,,,,,East Carolina University,The increased use of explosive devices within warfare and acts of terrorism has allowed blast overpressure exposure (BOE) to become a significant concern. The most common wound sustained by BOE is blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). These injuries involve no gross physical damage to the brain and evolve over time. The late manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms combined with no observable physical damage allows these injuries to largely remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for other mental disorders. This study aims to understand the effects of blast-induced neurotrauma and possibly improve diagnostics for these injuries. Anesthetized subjects were exposed to a single low-level blast overpressure of 10-12 psi. Behavioral assessments were performed at various time points to assess the evolution of blast-induced mTBIs. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) were extracted from whole blood and assessed for any changes in gene expression at 24 hours. one week. one month. and two months after BOE.  Morris water maze testing at 1 and 2 months after BOE was used to examine behavioral changes associated with BOE. Blasted subjects exhibited increased depression and impairments to learning and memory at one month but these changes were absent by two months after injury. Molecular assessments revealed five miRNAs commonly dysregulated across time points. miR- 27a. 30a. 34c. 449a and let-7c. The functional impact of these miRNAs was determined through pathway analysis using DAVID and GOrilla. Aberrant miRNA expression was found to regulate increased neurogenesis. synaptogesis. synaptic plasticity. long …,True,96-KCA8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://thescholarship.ecu.edu/handle/10342/5002,,,,https://thescholarship.ecu.edu/bitstream/handle/10342/5002/Dobbins_NEDL.pdf?sequence=4,0,0,0

However. drug resistance and side effects of toxicity on normal cells greatly diminish the anti-cancer outcome of cisplatin. In this study. glucose modification was conducted to improve cisplatin anti-cancer efficacy. Firstly. cisplatin was oxidized to c.c.t-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OH)2] and then a carboxyl group was introduced to obtain c.c.t-[Pt(NH3)2Cl2(OOCCH2CH2COOH)2] (Pt(IV)–COOH). and finally glucose was grafted onto Pt(IV)–COOH. The glucose modification of cisplatin opens the glucose transport channels (GTC) on the cell membrane for Pt drug. The opening of GTC increases the uptake of Pt drug for cells. This simple and effective modification strategy may not only mitigate toxicity to normal cells. but also increase the anti-cancer effect of Pt drugs.,True,LF6HXWwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002228601931470X,,,,,0,0,0

Protein dynamics drastically vary in temporal and spatial scales. The function of a particular protein determines the significance of a distinct type of dynamics. Here. we investigate the influence of hydration water on the dynamics of a protein called silk fibroin. Particular interest is to investigate the protein dynamics using thermal decay of the free radicals induced by ultraviolet irradiation. The full decay of the free radicals occurs at very wide temperature region (120 K–340 K). Three distinct regions with transition points of ∼135 K. 205 K. and 279 K are apparent in the thermal decay curves of hydrated fibroin samples. The first transition (∼135 K) that leads 2–6% increase of total spins was observed only in the decay curves of fibroin submerged in 40% and 50% glycerol. The second transition (∼205 K) was invariant for all samples. hydrated and dry fibroins. The third transition of 279 K common for all hydrated fibroin samples was shifted about 84 K to a higher temperature of 363 K in dry fibroin. The thermal transitions at 205 K and 279 K are weakly and strongly. respectively. coupled to water molecules. Nature of the free radicals participated in these transitions was identified.

Relative intensities as well as number of the resolved bands are significantly differ from each other within spectra. Possible mechanism of such selective enhancement of various bands and their dynamic nature are discussed. Ag nanoparticle system was also tested on complex body fluid system. whole blood.

Despite different treatment and management options. sepsis associated high morbidity and mortality rates remain. This has prompted intensive research into alternative therapeutic approaches such as targeted removal of sepsis related molecules using extracorporeal hemoperfusion. In this study. we explore the use of graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) as low-cost alternative hemosorbents for rapid removal of a broad spectrum of proinflammatory cytokine markers. Firstly. the physical characteristics. cytotoxicity. and cytokine marker adsorption profile of GNP were assessed. The results not only confirmed the surface characteristics of GNP and their ability to rapidly remove cytokine markers. but also indicated a low cytotoxicity towards the hepatic cell line HepG2.

1076440,Drosophila mutants suggest a strong drive toward complexity in evolution,2013,Leonore Fleming and Daniel W McShea,15,Evolution & development,1,53-62,,The view that complexity increases in evolution is uncontroversial. yet little is known about the possible causes of such a trend. One hypothesis. the Zero Force Evolutionary Law (ZFEL). predicts a strong drive toward complexity. although such a tendency can be overwhelmed by selection and constraints. In the absence of strong opposition. heritable variation accumulates and complexity increases. In order to investigate this claim. we evaluate the gross morphological complexity of laboratory mutants in Drosophila melanogaster. which represent organisms that arise in a context where selective forces are greatly reduced. Complexity was measured with respect to part types. shape. and color over two independent focal levels. Compared to the wild type. we find that D. melanogaster mutants are significantly more complex.

This model is inspired by the Zero Force Evolutionary Law. which states that there is always a tendency for diversity and complexity to increase in any evolutionary system containing variation and heredity. That is. in the absence of evolutionary forces. the expectation is a continual increase in diversity and complexity at any level of biological hierarchy.

Their reasons are not empirically based; rather. they are purely conceptual. We show that their conceptual presuppositions are unmotivated. unnecessary and overly complex. We also show that their conclusion runs contrary to current biological practice. The solution is to recognize that evolution involves a probabilistic sampling process. and that drift is a deviation from probabilistic expectation. We conclude that conceptually. there are no problems with distinguishing drift from selection. and empirically—as modern science illustrates—when drift does occur. there is a quantifiable fact of the matter to be discovered.,True,GKl494oAAAAJ:Tiz5es2fbqcC,6,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-014-9437-z?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst&error=cookies_not_supported&code=6dff7902-f251-4a44-a2ee-f5682660452b,16694065122474762377,/scholar?cites=16694065122474762377,,,0,0,0
1076445,The notion of limited perfect adaptedness in Darwin's principle of divergence,2013,Leonore Fleming,21,Perspectives on Science,1,1-22,MIT Press,Before publishing On the Origin of Species. Darwin held the view that well-adapted organisms were optimally designed to meet the specific challenges of an environment. and populations were not expected to change except from an environmental disturbance. Darwin later recognized the prevalence of environmental variation and employed a concept of relative adaptedness. I argue. against Don Ospovat. that Darwin did not entirely abandon his prior idea of “limited perfect adaptedness” when writing the Origin.

1076446,Two Dogmas of Biology,2017,Leonore Fleming,,,,,,The problem with reductionism in biology is not the reduction. but the implicit attitude of determinism that usually accompanies it. Methodological reductionism is supported by deterministic beliefs. but making such a connection is problematic when it is based on an idea of determinism as fixed predictability. Conflating determinism with predictability gives rise to inaccurate models that overlook the dynamic complexity of our world. as well as ignore our epistemic limitations when we try to model it. Furthermore. the assumption of a strictly deterministic framework is unnecessarily hindering to biology. By removing the dogma of determinism. biological methods. including reductive methods. can be expanded to include stochastic models and probabilistic interpretations. Thus. the dogma of reductionism can be saved once its ties with determinism are severed. In this paper. I analyze two problems that have faced molecular biology for the last 50 years—protein folding and cancer. Both cases demonstrate the long influence of reductionism and determinism on molecular biology. as well as how abandoning determinism has opened the door to more probabilistic and unconstrained reductive methods in biology.,True,GKl494oAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,3,https://philpapers.org/archive/FLETDO-10.pdf,13843089355710975594,/scholar?cites=13843089355710975594,,https://philpapers.org/archive/FLETDO-10.pdf,0,0,0

1076448,Variance. Selection and Evolutionary Explanation,2012,Leonore Fleming,,,,,,This dissertation presents some of the first work written and published on the Zero Force Evolutionary Law (McShea and Brandon 2010). It is a collection of four philosophy of biology papers about evolutionary explanation. which together. illustrate the importance of the Zero Force Evolutionary Law (ZFEL) spanning evolutionary studies. In particular. this dissertation includes issues in the history of philosophy of science(chapter 1). group formation and network theory (chapter 2). biological hierarchy and the major transitions in evolution (chapter 3). and the Price equation and quantifying evolutionary change (chapter 4). While these four chapters may differ in focus. they make the same general claim: evolutionary methods and explanations are improved when the underlying tendency of biological systems is characterized correctly as exhibiting increasing variance.The first chapter is a somewhat longer version of the paper.“The Notion of Limited Perfect Adaptedness in Darwin’s Principle of Divergence”. which was accepted on August. 22nd. 2011 for publication in Perspectives on Science.

The differentiation of illegal drug Cannabis from non-drug forms of Cannabis is relevant in the context of the growth of fibre and seed oil varieties of Cannabis for commercial purposes. This differentiation is currently determined based on the levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in adult plants. DNA based methods have the potential to assay Cannabis material unsuitable for analysis using conventional means including seeds. pollen and severely degraded material. The purpose of this research was to develop a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay for the differentiation of “drug” and “non-drug” Cannabis plants. An assay was developed based on four polymorphisms within a 399 bp fragment of the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) synthase gene. utilising the snapshot multiplex kit.

1076452,DNA analysis of plant material as forensic evidence,2012,David Rotherham,,,,,,The purpose of this research was to develop DNA based techniques for the analysis of botanical forensic evidence. The research included the analysis of Cannabis. the investigation of illegal logging and the analysis of plant material as trace evidence. A set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase gene. corresponding to functional and non-functional forms of the enzyme. were assayed using a mini-sequencing approach (SNaPshot). This enabled the differentiation of Cannabis containing high levels of the psychoactive agent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from low THC Cannabis. A multiplex of eleven STR loci was developed and tested across a set of 82 New Zealand Cannabis samples. Typing of New Zealand Cannabis revealed significant departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. likely due to the effect of clonal reproduction on genotypic diversity in the New Zealand Cannabis population. Unusual triallelic patterns were observed at some loci in a small number of individuals. Sequencing of homozygotes revealed that while most alleles contained the expected repeat region point mutations and insertion/deletion events were also present in some alleles. In one notable example the published repeat sequence did not appear to vary. A set of 13 Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) primers were amplified in the native forest tree Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum). Although the ISSR primers tested were variable the length of the amplified fragments was considered unsuitable for the analysis of Rimu in the context of illegal logging.

The proposed dissociative MVIIA-P22 nanocontainer will provide a robust method for delivering neuropeptides to their site of action to manipulate neuronal signals associated with chronic pain.Due to side effects associated with opioid drugs. nonopioids have been pursued to discover novel analgesic therapies. Ziconotide (Prialt®). discovered from Conus magus. is the first non-opioid marine snail drug approved for treatment of chronic pain in cancer and HIV patients. Despite being a breakthrough drug. widespread application of ziconotide is limited due to its size (25 amino acids). and lack of efficacy when delivered via common routes. an intrathecal delivery is required as ziconotide does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Presented here is an alternative strategy to intrathecal application of ziconotide by encapsulating it in a viral capsid nanocontainer for delivery across the BBB. Viral capsids. such as the Salmonella typhimuriam bacteriophage P22 capsid. are ideal encapsulation vehicles as they can be made in large quantities. have constrained interior spaces amendable for assembly and packaging bioactive cargo. and have large surface areas that are conducive to multivalent genetic and chemical modifications. Specifically. the interior of P22 capsid was modified with the sequence of ziconotide (MVIIA) at the C-terminus of the P22 scaffold protein.

October 2015/Available online: 01. June 2016/Printed: June 2016 Abstract. Fethiye beaches are the one of the most important sea turtle nesting beaches from Turkey. The reproductive biology of nesting loggerhead turtles was investigated there during three consecutive nesting seasons (2011-2013). A total of 253 nests were recorded in three seasons. and these nests included an average 80.4 eggs per nests. The incubation periods have decreased considerably over the last decade. potentially pointing to a climate change effect. The nest density was 7.2 nests/km in 2011. 10.7 nests/km in 2012 and 12.6 nests/km in 2013. Despite this 3-year increase. the overall number of nests over the last two decades shows a gradual decline. although the pattern differs from beach to beach. It was determined that the habitat loss and tourism activities are the main problems and are effect breeding activities of the species. In this respect. site-specific conservation actions were started at the Fethiye beaches.,True,RV-51G4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Musa_Azmaz2/publication/285322728_Monitoring_and_Conservation_of_Loggerhead_Turtle's_nests_on_Fethiye_Beaches_Turkey/links/5763a2a308aeab6e490aa968/Monitoring-and-Conservation-of-Loggerhead-Turtles-nests-on-Fethiye-Beaches-Turkey.pdf,13433952907405282586,/scholar?cites=13433952907405282586,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Musa_Azmaz2/publication/285322728_Monitoring_and_Conservation_of_Loggerhead_Turtle's_nests_on_Fethiye_Beaches_Turkey/links/5763a2a308aeab6e490aa968/Monitoring-and-Conservation-of-Loggerhead-Turtles-nests-on-Fethiye-Beaches-Turkey.pdf,0,0,0

In fact. Algerian ethnopharmacology was a combination of ancient knowledge inherited from Islamic civilization and purely empirical uses of substances of different origins; plant. animal and inorganic. The study showed the existence of non-systematic knowledge of plants oriented by knowledge in classical medicine and the use of a large number of ingredients separately or in mixture according to very diverse therapeutic formulas.

Sensitivities to metals of subantarctic and Antarctic species may contrast with related species from temperate and tropical areas because of the unique characteristics of polar biota. In addition. response to contaminants may be delayed. and hence longer exposure periods may be required in toxicity tests with polar species. In the present study. the sensitivity of 6 common subantarctic marine invertebrates to copper. zinc. and cadmium contaminants was determined. Large variations in sensitivities. both between species and between metals within species. were found.

1076497,The Study of Artemisinin Content in Callus Artemisia annua L. Cultures Elicited with Endophytic Fungi Aspergillus sp.,2018,Farida Yuliani and Widyatmani Sih Dewi and Ahmad Yunus and Usman Siswanto,13,Molekul,2,155-161,,Artemisinin. is a sesquiterpene lactone which is originally extracted from the medicinal plant Artemisia annua L. Artemisinin is a very effective antimalarial agent. however it is produced in very low amounts in plants. Chemical synthesis of artemisinin is complicated and not economically feasible. Researchers often use elicitation methods to increase artemisinin content in a laboratory scale with biotic or abiotic elicitor. This study examined the effect of elicitation using endophytic fungi Aspergillus sp on artemisinin content of callus A. annua cultures. Observations were made on its growth. texture and color. chlorophyll content and dry weight. Fungi were isolated from the stem tissue of A. annua and callus were grown on Murashige and Skoog medium. After 3 weeks of incubation. callus treated with four different elicitors concentration (0. 2. 4. 6 mg/mL). There were significant alterations on callus culture in terms of growth. texture. color and chlorophyll content after elicitation. The results clearly demonstrated that the endophytic fungal elicitor Aspergillus sp could increase artemisinin content but did not affect the callus dry weight of A. annua. The treatment of 4 mg/mL elicitor produced the highest artemisinin content. that increased 7.6 times compared to the control. from 0.0036% to 0.0275%.,True,qtQNmPgAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,4,https://www.ojs.jmolekul.com/ojs/index.php/jm/article/view/459,12422915962481312308,/scholar?cites=12422915962481312308,,https://www.ojs.jmolekul.com/ojs/index.php/jm/article/download/459/290,0,0,0

A method is proposed in which anion exchange membranes (AEM) are added to the soil suspension after an initial period of isotopic exchange with 32P‐labelled phosphate ions. Isotopically exchanged P. termed EAEM. is calculated from the ratio of labelled phosphate ions to the total phosphate ions on the membrane. The EAEM was compared with the E value measured in an aqueous soil extract (EWater extract) for 14 soils with different degrees of P sorption. The two methods gave similar results in soils with large P concentrations in an aqueous soil extract. However.

Phosphorus availability was assessed using an isotopic exchange technique and anion exchange membranes. The total P content was higher for the Chilean andosols and remained relatively high in the whole soil profile (1413-187 mg P kg-1) whereas total P decreased sharply in the lower horizons of the Flemish podzols (575-4 mg P kg-1). There was a strong predominance of organic P in the Chilean soils (up to 90% of total P). The high volcanic activity in Chile is responsible for the large amounts of allophone. which entail high P-fixing capacities in these soils. Notwithstanding the much larger total P content in Chilean andosols compared to the Flemish podzols. both soil types feature comparable amounts of available P (AEM-P).

The WD40 domain protein Ebi has been implicated in the regulation of Notch signaling at the DV boundary. Here we show that Ebi regulates wing growth by antagonizing the function of the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb). Ebi physically binds to the extracellular domain of Crb (Crbext). and this interaction is specifically mediated by WD40 repeats 7-8 of Ebi and a laminin G domain of Crbext. Wing notching resulting from reduced levels of Ebi is suppressed by decreasing the Crb function. Consistent with this antagonistic genetic relationship. Ebi knockdown in the DV boundary elevates the Crb protein level. Furthermore. we show that Ebi is required for downregulation of Crb by ubiquitylation. Taken together. we propose that the interplay of Crb expression in the DV boundary and ubiquitin-dependent …,True,j9epFrQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://dev.biologists.org/content/143/19/3506.abstract,6581384202178067079,/scholar?cites=6581384202178067079,,https://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/143/19/3506.full.pdf,0,0,0

Previously. we have shown that Klp64D. a motor subunit of Drosophila kinesin-II. interacts with Arm for Wg signaling. Molecular basis for this interaction has remained unknown. Here we identify a critical Arm repeat (AR) required for binding Klp64D and Wg signaling. Arm/\({\varvec {\beta}}\)-catenin family proteins contain a conserved domain of 12 Arm repeats (ARs). Five of these ARs can interact with Klp64D. but only the second AR (AR2) binds to the cargo/tail domain of Klp64D. Overexpression of AR2 in wing imaginal disc is sufficient to cause notched wing margin. This phenotype by AR2 is enhanced or suppressed by reducing or increasing Klp64D expression. respectively.

Co‐expression of VpPR10.1/VpVDAC3 induced cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana. which accompanied by ROS accumulation. VpPR10.1 transgenic grapevine line showed resistance to P. viticola.

Resveratrol and piceid are synthesized in VaSTS7-. VvSTS22-. VaSTS22-transgenic Arabidopsis. To study the function of these STS genes in the resistance against Botrytis cinerea in vivo. lesion sizes on these STS transgenic Arabidopsis were compared to that on non-transgenic control Col-0. at 96 hours post inoculation with B. cinerea spores at 0. 200. or 1.000 spores/μl. In each experiment there were three biological replicates. Three lesion sizes from each replicate were averaged. The experiment was repeated three times. The results showed that the STS-overexpressing Arabidopsis did not show resistance to B. cinerea. indicating that single STS gene might not be fully functional in defending against B. cinerea. In a second project. two new Grapevine vein clearing virus (GVCV) isolates were sequenced and analyzed. The two GVCV isolates have 99.8% identical nucleotide sequence. thus were considered as same strain although they were isolated from two plants in different genera of the Vitaceae family. The conserved domains. secondary structure of leader RNA. and phylogenetic relationship were predicted among seven isolates. The results provide new evidence that GVCV spreads across plants in different genera.

Four Si amendment treatments (1. 1.5. 2 and 2.5 mmol· L-1) and one control treatment (no Si) were conducted in the growth chamber. Silicon fertilizer significantly improved (P 0.05) seed germination rate. germination energy and germination index. The length and fresh weight of seedlings significantly increased after 35 d treatment which increased with the increasing concentration of silicon fertilizer. The root length. total surface areas of roots and average root diameter increased although only the indices with 2.5 mmol· L-1Si treatment were significantly higher (P 0.05) than the control.

Between species. however. there is no correlation between cancer and either body size or lifespan. indicating that large. long-lived species have evolved enhanced cancer protection mechanisms. Elephants and their relatives (Proboscideans) are a particularly interesting lineage for the exploration of mechanisms underlying the evolution of augmented cancer resistance because they evolved large bodies recently within a clade of smaller bodied species (Afrotherians). Here. we explore the contribution of gene duplication to body size and cancer risk in Afrotherians. Unexpectedly. we found that tumor suppressor duplication was pervasive in Afrotherian genomes. rather than restricted to Proboscideans. Proboscideans. however. have duplicates in unique pathways that may underlie some aspects of their remarkable anti-cancer cell biology. These data suggest that duplication of tumor suppressor genes facilitated the evolution of increased body size by compensating for decreasing intrinsic cancer risk.,True,DPrxytUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://elifesciences.org/articles/65041,,,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/65041,0,0,0
1076575,The Role of Tumor-Supressor Duplications in Mediating Peto's Paradox,,Juan M Vazquez and Vincent J Lynch,,,,,,While all multicellular organisms should have the potential to develop cancer in their lifetimes. the rate at which they develop tumors throughout their life holds no correlation to either body size or lifespan. an observation known as Peto's Paradox. One hypothesis is that large and/or long-lived animals have evolved mechanisms to lower their overall per-cell tumor risk. Gene duplications are an important and well-established mechanism of evolution. and have previously been shown to be enriched in long-lived lineages such as the Bowhead Whale and Bats. By using available genomes and transcriptome data for species in families which contain exceptionally large and/or long-lived members. various duplications of known tumor suppressors were identified. and are being characterized as possible factors in the resolution of Peto's Paradox in these species. We will discuss 2 such genes which have been duplicated in large. long-lived animals: CDKN2C and LIF. duplicated in the Bowhead Whale and in Elephants. respectively. and their initial characterizations.,True,DPrxytUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://vazquez.bio/publication/bowheadwhalep18/Poster-GRC2017.pdf,,,,https://vazquez.bio/publication/bowheadwhalep18/Poster-GRC2017.pdf,0,0,0

This process requires otoferlin. a six C2-domain. Ca2+-binding transmembrane protein of synaptic vesicles. To decipher the role of otoferlin in the synaptic vesicle cycle. we produced knock-in mice (Otof Ala515.Ala517/Ala515.Ala517) with lower Ca2+-binding affinity of the C2C domain. The IHC ribbon synapse structure. synaptic Ca2+ currents. and otoferlin distribution were unaffected in these mutant mice. but auditory brainstem response wave-I amplitude was reduced. Lower Ca2+ sensitivity and delay of the fast and sustained components of synaptic exocytosis were revealed by membrane capacitance measurement upon modulations of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. by varying Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+-channels or Ca2+ uncaging. Otoferlin thus functions as a Ca2+ sensor. setting the rates of primed vesicle fusion with the presynaptic plasma membrane and synaptic vesicle pool replenishment in the IHC active zone.,True,kJ6zfLEAAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,53,https://elifesciences.org/articles/31013,8573132319059080089,/scholar?cites=8573132319059080089,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/31013.pdf,0,0,0

The deafness is nonsyndromic. and appears before 4 years of age. Pure-tone audiometry shows a bilateral and symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. which aﬀects all frequencies. Air conduction pure-tone average may be moderate to profound. Low-tone thresholds (0.25–0.5 kHz) vary between 15 and 90 dB. The hearing loss is more important in the high frequencies (4–8 kHz); thresholds are over 70 dB and a large proportion of the aﬀected individuals have no hearing at 120 dB. According to the classiﬁcation of Liu [2]. audiometric shapes are either gently or sharply sloping (see ﬁg. 1). The deafness is either slightly or nonprogressive.

Both SP‐selective processing by the AN2 and the phonotactic behaviour of the female exhibit substantial plasticity. Thus. the question remains as to whether the selective responses of the AN2 neurone and the selective behaviour of the female match in an individual female. The present study is designed to answer that question. The SP‐selective phonotactic behaviour of individual females is evaluated. followed immediately by measuring the SP‐selective responses of the same female's AN2 neurone.

1076618,P-25 Male exposure reduces the response of female crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) to the male’s calling song: The roles of two auditory neurons,2013,John Stout and Leslie Samuel and Steven Lee,,,,,,We have evaluated female phonotaxis (walk toward males’ calls) using virgin and male-exposed (raised in the same container) females. While nearly 100% of virgin females respond phonotactically. about 40% of male-exposed females do not respond to models of the males’ calling songs (CSs) and those that respond (60%) exhibit quantitative differences in their responses. In virgin females. the AN2 neuron receives excitatory stimulation from the cricket’s ear and responds selectively to model CSs that represent the CSs of calling males. This selective response is very significantly correlated with the same female’s behavioral response to that call. In many male-exposed females. the AN2 neuron does not respond selectively to the CSs that represent calling males. This difference is the result of inhibitory input from the ON1 auditory neuron that in many male-exposed females.“destroys” AN2’s selective response to models of a calling male’s calling song. AN2s in virgin females that are “forced” to respond to model CSs similarly to the AN2 responses in male-exposed females are highly correlated with the failure of the virgin female to respond phonotactically to that CS.,True,_nKREjMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/cor/2013/poster-presentations/18/,,,,,0,0,0

The mechanism in which incompatibility is expressed is not yet fully understood and several hypotheses have been advanced in an attempt to explain it. In many cases (pear on quince grafts. apricot on Prunus grafts). incompatibility is manifested by the breaking of the trees at the point of the union particularly when they have been growing for some years. Many reports focus on this problem in order to understand the mechanisms of graft development. These reports refer to both cytological and biochemical responses occurring at an early phase in response to grafting. as well as to the consequences of these events on the future graft response. In this experiment. we tried to highlight how affinity between scion and rootstock can influence the photosynthetic apparatus and carbohydrates synthesis. The results showed that grafting affinity has an influence on total assimilating pigments content. Thus. on the pear cultivars grafted on an incompatible rootstock (cultivars/Cydonia oblonga) the total pigments content ratio (reported to the ungrafted rootstock) ranged between 0.58 and 0.69. However. the combinations had a ratio ranging between 0.79 and 0.98. Nevertheless. the assimilating pigments ratio reduction had no influence on photosynthetic rate. The soluble sugars amount was close in both variants (cultivars/Cydonia oblonga and cultivars/Pyrus sativa).,True,9xPZrw4AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,28,http://www.notulaebotanicae.ro/index.php/nbha/article/view/4607,10595271143399991988,/scholar?cites=10595271143399991988,,https://www.notulaebotanicae.ro/index.php/nbha/article/download/4607/4441,0,0,0

For this purpose. the expression of PALs. 4CLs and CHS genes in red raspberry plants grown in soil and in a soil: peat mixture was investigated. Transcriptional profiling was performed on leaf tissues collected from plants grown in semi-controlled greenhouse conditions and exposed to different soil water levels such as full water supply (90% FC). moderate (50% FC). and severe water stress (35% FC).

To elucidate how grafting influences the flow of carbon from shoots to tree roots and nitrogen from the roots to the shoots two sets of tests were carried out that have targeted the dosage of soluble sugars (to emphasize the relative flow of carbon) and nitrogen content dosage around the grafting union area. After many laboratory analyses. we obtained average values that reflect the dynamics of soluble sugars content depending on grafting. namely: 24% in the scion. 41% into the union area and 35% in the rootstock. in a ratio of about 1: 1.7: 1.4. In what concerns the total nitrogen content. we observed that the values are very similar between variants. Instead. somewhat higher nitrogen quantities (36%) were obtained in the rootstocks compared to the union area (32%) and scions (32%) representing a ratio of 1: 1: 1.1. Performing our experiments we found that the distribution of soluble sugars and nitrogen. in particular. in the grafting union area and the flow of photoassimilates and mineral elements. in general. for first year grafted trees depends not so much on the compatibility between scion and rootstock. but on grafting itself.

Ayn Rand Explained is an accurate and riveting account of Rand’s life. work. and influence. with the emphasis on her ideas. The book covers Rand’s career. from youth in Soviet Russia to Hollywood screenwriter and then to ideological guru; her novels and other fiction writings; her work in ethics. epistemology. and metaphysics; her influence on—and personal animosity toward—both conservatism and libertarianism. Rand’s Objectivism encompasses the ethics of rational egoism (‘The Virtue of Selfishness’); dedication to rational thinking and acting; rejection of faith in the supernatural. personal freedom from political interference. and a moral defense of limited government and laissez-faire. Objectivism was first promoted through the Nathaniel Branden Institute. headed by Rand’s young protégé and designated heir. The Institute’s phenomenally rapid growth was abruptly cut short when Rand expelled Branden and his followers in 1968. Today Objectivism is represented by different factions. notably the Ayn Rand Institute and the Atlas Society.

Ils sont activés par une acidose extracellulaire et le proton reste jusqu’à présent leur seul activateur endogène. Les ASIC3 sont notamment exprimés dans les neurones sensoriels périphériques innervant la peau. les muscles. les viscères et les articulations.

En effet. j’ai pu démontrer que des lipides (ie. la lysophosphatidylcholine et l’acide arachidonique) présents dans les liquides synoviaux issus de patients souffrants de différentes pathologies articulaires douloureuses. étaient capables d’activer les canaux ASIC3 sans acidification extracellulaire. Ces lipides sont capables de générer un comportement douloureux chez les rongeurs. qui implique au moins en partie les canaux ASIC3. Lors de la seconde partie de ma thèse je me suis intéressé à la régulation des canaux ASIC3 par la température.

In this study. we evaluated the treatment effects of mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on mouse liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride. Portal and tail vein transplantations were examined to evaluate the effects of different injection routes on the liver cirrhosis model at 21 days after transplantation. BM-MSCs transplantation reduced aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase levels at 21 days after injection. Furthermore. BM-MSCs induced positive changes in serum bilirubin and albumin and downregulated expression of integrins (600- to 7000-fold). transforming growth factor. and procollagen-α1 compared with the control group. Interestingly. both injection routes ameliorated inflammation and liver cirrhosis scores. All mice in treatment groups had reduced inflammation scores and no cirrhosis. In conclusion. transplantation of BM-MSCs via tail or portal veins ameliorates liver cirrhosis in mice. Notably. there were no differences in treatment effects between tail and portal vein administrations.

Res. Ther,5,2332-2348,,Background: Transplantation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) is a potential therapy for a variety of liver diseases. Previous studies have shown that ADSC-based therapy is promising for liver fibrosis treatment. Recently. many publications have suggested that pretreating ADSCs with growth factors before transplantation can elevate the effectiveness of the therapy. Therefore. we hypothesize that human ADSCs (hADSCs) pre-treated with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). compared to ADSCs alone. would accelerate the treatment effects on liver fibrosis in mice. Methods: The hADSCs were cultured solely with conventional media. or with HGF (human recombinant; 20 ng/ml). or with HGF and PRP (from healthy human blood. 10%). concomitantly added to the medium for 7 days before transplantation. Eight-week-old male mice were treated with CCl4 (1 ml/kg) for 11 weeks to induce liver fibrosis.

Results: After 21 days of transplantation. the results showed that the stem cell treated groups ameliorated better than the placebo group. MSC treated groups showed reduced AST and ALT levels. down-regulated expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. and improved liver histopathology. Both sources of MSCs (bone marrow and adipose tissue) were effective in the mouse model of liver fibrosis. Conclusion: Our results also indicated that AD-MSC transplantation in mice accelerated liver regeneration better than BM-MSC transplantation.,True,R1ILEgcAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,http://home.biomedpress.org/index.php/BMRAT/article/download/179/508,6398155094802469452,/scholar?cites=6398155094802469452,,http://home.biomedpress.org/index.php/BMRAT/article/download/179/508,0,0,0

Irrespective of the etiology of LF. a key element in its development is the transition of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) from a quiescent phenotype to a myofibroblast-like cell with the production of fibrotic proteins. It is necessary to define optimal isolation and culturing conditions for good HSCs yield and proper phenotype preservation for studying the activation of HSCs in vitro. In the present study. the optimal conditions of HSC isolation and culture were examined to maintain the HSC’s undifferentiated phenotype. HSCs were isolated from Balb/c mice liver using Nycodenz. 8. 9.6. and 11%. The efficiency of the isolation procedure was evaluated by cell counting and purity determination by flow cytometry.

Adipose-derived stem cell (ADSCs). are considered to be a promised candidate for liver disease treatment. including liver cirrhosis treatment. Recent studies show that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) can stimulate ADSC to migrate to the injured areas and platelet rich plasma (PRP) can increase the stemness of ADSCs.Method: In this study. we cultured ADSCs in the medium supplemented 20 ng/ml and 10% PRP; then transplanted them into the cirrhosis mouse model. After 11 weeks of CCl4 induction (1ml/kg. three times per week). mice were divided into 3 groups:(1) PBS group which were injected 0.2 ml PBS;(2) ADSC group which were transplanted 5x105 ADSCs non-pretreated with HGF and PRP;(3) ADSC/HGF+ PRP group which were transplanted 5x105 ADSCs pretreated with HGF and PRP via the tail vein. We evaluated the effectiveness of the therapeutic at the day 7th and 14th after transplantation.Results: The results show that the transplantation of ADSC pretreated with HGF and PRP after seven days improves the body weight (increase 4.673%); decreases the ALT level (p< 0.05). the total leukocyte number (p< 0.05) and the expression of Pro-collagen (decrease 4.1 times) as well as α-SMA (decrease 5.1 times). in comparison to the ADSC group. ADSCs pretreated with HGF and PRP also help to improve the liver tissue structure.Conclusion: The therapy using ADSCs pretreated with HGF and PRP is considered to be a promising therapy.,True,R1ILEgcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,http://home.biomedpress.org/index.php/BMRAT/article/download/348/691,,,,http://home.biomedpress.org/index.php/BMRAT/article/download/348/691,0,0,0

Mead and W.H. Desuky,35,Bulletin of Entomological Society of Egypt.,,171-188,Entomological Society of Egypt,The two-spotted spider mite. Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the most important pests responsible for significant yield losses in many economic crops including cotton fields. The massive and prolonged application of the traditional insecticides resulted in adverse effects on the environment. acute and chronic hazardous to human and beneficial insects. which found in the cotton fields and help to control pests (Duffie et al.. 1998 & Badawy and El-Arnaouty. 1999). Furthermore. a major problem in the control of T. urticae is its ability to rapidly develop resistance to many important acaricides after only few applications (Stumpf and Nauen. 2002). During the past two decades many attempts have been made to replace synthetic pesticides by alternative compounds which are recognized as harmless. short persistent and more specific such as the insect growth regulators (IGRs) which have received much attention as possible control agents for several pests because of their delayed toxic action (Price and Schuster. 1991 and Bambawale et al.. 1995). Insect growth regulators contain two major groups. juvenile hormone analogues (JHAۥs) and chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) that considered as insect development inhibitors. which they exert their effect through interference with chitin production during cuticle development in mite and insect immature stages (El-Atrouzy et al.. 1989).

India harbors hundreds of hot springs. the majority of which are not yet explored and require comprehensive studies to unravel their unknown and untapped phylogenetic and functional diversity. The aim of this study was to perform a large-scale metagenomic analysis of three major hot springs located in central India namely. Badi Anhoni. Chhoti Anhoni and Tattapani at two geographically distinct regions (Anhoni and Tattapani). to uncover the resident microbial community and their metabolic traits. Samples were collected from seven distinct sites of the three hot spring locations with temperature ranging from 43.5-98°C. The 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of V3 hypervariable region and shotgun metagenome sequencing uncovered a unique taxonomic and metabolic diversity of the resident thermophilic microbial community in these hot springs. Genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation pathways. such as benzoate. xylene. toluene. and benzene were observed to be abundant in the Anhoni hot springs (43.5-55 °C). dominated by Pseudomonas stutzeri and Acidovorax sp.. suggesting the presence of chemoorganotrophic thermophilic community with the ability to utilize complex hydrocarbons as a source of energy.

Ntr1. and Ppr43. Cwc23 is an essential J-protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that recruits Ntr1. an NTC-related G-patch protein. to the spliceosome. Ntr1 interacts with Prp43. a DExD/H box RNA helicase protein. which facilitates the disassembly of spliceosomal intermediates. The interaction between Ntr1 and Prp43 is conserved and crucial for the disassembly process. However. the J-protein component of this complex is not studied in other eukaryotes. In silico analysis supported by results of yeast complementation and two-hybrid studies suggests that while Prp43 is highly conserved. both Ntr1 and Cwc23 are co-evolving components of the disassembly triad.

By employing text-mining approaches. research trends were tested by analyzing over 14.000 publications during the period of 1957 to 2017. Quantitatively. the data revealed an exponential growth until 2010 when the number of articles published per year ceased following the trend. Analysis of author-assigned keywords revealed that changes in keywords occurred roughly every decade with the most fundamental change in 1991–1992. instead of 2006. This change might be due to several factors including the research intensification on the Varroa mite. The genome release and CCD had quantitively only minor effects. mainly on honey bee health-related topics post-2006. Further analysis revealed that computational topic modeling can provide potentially hidden information and connections between some topics that might be ignored in author-assigned keywords.

Charles Darwin spent several weeks in Galápagos exploring the islands and making extensive notes on their natural history. Darwin in Galápagos is the first book to recreate Darwin's historic visit to the islands. following in his footsteps day by day and island by island as he records all that he observes around him. Thalia Grant and Gregory Estes meticulously retrace Darwin's island expeditions. taking you on an unforgettable guided tour. Drawing from Darwin's original notebooks and logs from the Beagle. the latest findings by Darwin scholars and modern science. and their own intimate knowledge of the archipelago. Grant and Estes offer rare insights into Darwin's thinking about evolution in the context of the actual locales that inspired him. They introduce Darwin as a young naturalist in England and onboard the Beagle and then put you in his shoes as he explores remote places in the islands. They identify the unique animals and plants he observed and collected. and describe dramatic changes to the islands since Darwin's time. They also explore the importance of Darwin's observations and collections to the development of his thinking after the voyage. Ideal for visitors to Galápagos and a delight for armchair travelers.

1076711,Post-stroke depression,2006,OA Levada and EI Slivko,,,,73-79,,In recent years. post-stroke depression (PSD) has attracted a worldwide interest. This review addresses the major research issues of PSD. PSD is the most frequent psychic complication among stroke survivors. Depression has a significant impact on post-stroke recovery and mortality. The diagnosis of PSD is based on the structured mental state examination and DSM-IV criteria as well as on the scores of the clinical symptoms scale (the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and self-rated inventories. PSD is multifactorial in origin and develops under the influence of biopsychosocial factors. The anatomical correlates of PSD change over time. In acute stage and 3-6 months after stroke. depression is associated with left-hemisphere lesion severity and proximity of the lesion to the frontal pole and related to the dysfunction of (cortico-) striato-pallido-thalamic-cortical projections. In post-stroke period (1-2 years) depression is significantly associated with right-hemisphere lesion severity and proximity of the lesion to the occipital pole. The most relevant psychosocial risk factors for PSD are described as follows: past history of depression and other mental disorders. dysphasia. functional impairment. living alone and post-stroke social isolation.

CBCD e SBMD. FBG. SBH. SOBED,BACKGROUND:  Hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) are the two most common infections among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.  OBJECTIVE:  To identify the frequency of HIV subtypes and HCV genotypes in HIV-coinfected patients.  METHODS:  A cross-sectional and retrospective study was carried out into two reference centers in Southern Brazil between January 1. 2002 and June 30. 2016. The Abbott Real Time HCV Genotype II system was used for routine diagnostics to determine the HCV genotype based on dual-target real-time PCR. Proviral HIV-1 RNA was extracted from serum samples and fragments of the pol gene were generated by PCR. The HIV-1 PT and RT gene sequences were submitted to Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic analysis by collecting reference sequences from the HIV-1 group M subtype of the Los Alamos database.  RESULTS:  During the study period. 3340 patients with HIV were diagnosed at both referral centers. of which 4.97% (166/3340) had HBV and/or HCV coinfection. Seroprevalence of HIV-HBV. HIV-HCV and HIV-HBV-HCV was 37.4%. 58.4%. and 4.2%. respectively. HIV-HCV-coinfected patients had a lower median nadir CD4+ T-cell count when compared to HIV-HBV-coinfected patients (P=0.01). Among those coinfected with HCV. HCV-1 (HCV-1) and HCV-3 (HCV-3) genotypes were the most prevalent. being detected in 73.8% and 21.4%. respectively. Among the HCV-1 coinfected patients. 79.3% and 20.1% had subtypes 1a and 1b. respectively. HIV subtype B was the most prevalent in HIV-coinfected patients.

1076741,Comparing the success of active and passive restoration in a tropical cloud forest landscape: A multi-taxa fauna approach,2020,Juan Manuel Díaz-García and Fabiola López-Barrera and Eduardo Pineda and Tarin Toledo-Aceves and Ellen Andresen,15,Plos one,11,e0242020,Public Library of Science,Tropical forest restoration initiatives are becoming more frequent worldwide in an effort to mitigate biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation. However. there is little consensus on whether an active or a passive restoration strategy is more successful for recovering biodiversity because few studies make adequate comparisons. Furthermore. studies on animal responses to restoration are scarce compared to those on plants. and those that assess faunal recovery often focus on a single taxon. limiting the generalization of results. We assessed the success of active (native mixed-species plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) tropical cloud forest restoration strategies based on the responses of three animal taxa: amphibians. ants. and dung beetles. We compared community attributes of these three taxa in a 23-year-old active restoration forest. a 23-year-old passive restoration forest. a cattle pasture. and a mature forest. with emphasis on forest-specialist species. We also evaluated the relationship between faunal recovery and environmental variables. For all taxa. we found that recovery of species richness and composition were similar in active and passive restoration sites. However. recovery of forest specialists was enhanced through active restoration. For both forests under restoration. similarity in species composition of all faunal groups was 60–70% with respect to the reference ecosystem due to a replacement of generalist species by forest-specialist species. The recovery of faunal communities was mainly associated with canopy and leaf litter covers.

Dietary composition in amphibians may be influenced by several factors that cause their intraspecific variation. such as geographic distribution. ontogeny. seasonality. and sex of organisms. The objective of this study was to analyze the composition of the diet in adults of the Polymorphic Robber Frog Craugastor rhodopis in the mountainous region of central Veracruz. Mexico. A total of 77 adult individuals were collected during the rainy season of 2012. of which 66 had stomach contents. We performed an analysis of the intersexual variation in diet diversity. volume. number of prey. and number of prey categories consumed. The diet of C. rhodopis was composed by 20 categories. Orthoptera predominated in terms of number. volume. frequency of occurrence. and relative importance. Males consumed smaller prey items relative to females. Although both sexes consumed similar numbers of prey. we found a significant effect of interaction of sex and size of frogs on this variable. with small females consuming more prey than the large ones. whereas in males the opposite occurred. High consumption of orthopterans (at least in volume) is a common phenomenon within Craugastoridae and is possibly related to the success of some species in the ecosystems where they live. Although the composition of the diet was similar between sexes in C. rhodopis. we suggest that intersexual competition for trophic resources is minimal. given differences in prey size consumed by males and females.,True,E5DSxooAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/33135/36953?inline=1,,,,https://revistas.ucr.ac.cr/index.php/rbt/article/download/33135/36953?inline=1,0,0,0

Patterns of weed seedling emergence affect the outcome of weed–crop interference interactions. Information on weed seedling emergence in relation to crop seeding will assist in developing an optimum weed control program. Weeds emerge simultaneously with a crop. have the greatest potential impact on crop production. Results from Chauhan & Johnson (2010) showed the advantage for weeds over rice in situations where these species emerge earlier in the growing season because of significantly greater biomass production comparing to those emerging later in the season. Minimal shading and competition for nutrients and soil moisture are associated with early emergence. The importance of density in competition studies is because of the relationship among plant yield. number of individuals. and resources present. Increasing the density may enhance the plant’s share of the total resource pool and reduce resource availability for adjacent plant. Thus. to analyze competition between the crop and weeds. the variation in density should be considered. Season-long competition with watergrass at densities of 86 and 36 plants/m2 reduced rice yields by 59% and 46%. respectively.

Consequences of watergrass–rice competition are influenced by each species proportion and density; although could be greatly affected by relative weed seedling emergence time. Furthermore to analyze crop-weed competition. the variation in plant traits that confer competitive ability should be considered. Total dry matter and leaf area as the basic processes in vegetative growth. and plant height. dry weight. and leaf area index as the indications of the relative size. photosynthetic capacity. and productivity. affect competitive ability. Rice traits were associated with competitiveness against weeds included Initial biomass. crop growth rate. leaf area index. and biomass at tillering.

Yet. tumors are rich in signals driving terminal differentiation of T SL cells into exhausted T cells. Using the “KP-NINJA” lung tumor model. we determined that tumor-specific T SL cells terminally differentiate in tumors. but that they are maintained by a reservoir of T SL cells from the tumor-draining lymph node (dLN). By tracing clones of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells using single-cell RNA/TCRseq. we found that dLN T SL cells were the developmental precursors of the more differentiated intratumoral T cell populations. Moreover. dLN T SL cells were developmentally stable over the disease course and blocking egress from dLNs resulted in a decrease in intratumoral T SL cells. Thus. we propose that the dLN reservoir protects the overall tumor-specific T cell population from terminal differentiation. allowing for prolonged responses under conditions of chronic antigen exposure.

The reduction or abrogation of POT1 DNA binding activity in mammalian cells results in telomere elongation. or activation of the ATR DNA damage response at telomeres. Therefore. overhang binding represents the functionally relevant activity of POT1. To better understand the roles of POT1. we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the DNA binding domain of the protein.

Sixty seven species belonging to 26 genera and 16 families of the hermatypic corals were recorded. The most dominant genera were. Porites. Acropora. Millepora. Stylophora. Pocillopora and Lobophyllia. Oil pollution have the greatest harm effect on coral reef distribution. where the lowest percent covers of life corals were recorded at Ras Gharib (61%). While. the lowest harm was due to tourism and phosphate industries. Where. the highest percents were found at Al-Qusier city (84%). Tubipora musuca recorded its highest percent cover nonexpectedly in presence of chronic oil pollution (Ras Gharib). In contrast. this species was completely disappeared in presence of phosphate. Petroleum oil led to coral scarcity and increased sea urchins at Ras Gharib. Coral reefs enriched with phosphate in the field. surprisingly was a companied by extraordinary well flourishing. The lowest amount of dead corals in Al-Qusier may be due to the rough conditions (strong wind and waves) causing difficulties in accessing that site.

On 4 June 2011. an eruption in the Puyehue volcanic complex (40°35′S. 72°06′W. Chile) discharged massive amounts of ash and pumice into the surrounding landscape in Argentina (North Andean Patagonia). The ejected material affected nearby aquatic environments. producing an increase in total suspended solids. We combined field data and laboratory experiment data to determine the effect of the volcanic ashes suspended in the water column on cladoceran populations. During the summer of 2011–2012 (6 months after the eruption). zooplankton populations in these lakes decreased. mainly due to the disappearance of cladocerans.

The study was carried out at three different scales: sub cellular. population and ecosystemic. Cladocerans are filter feeding organisms that cannot distinguish between food (algae less than 30 µm) and suspended ash. therefore when feeding they ingest this material. The ash affected negatively the individuals at a biochemical level. increasing the oxidative stress reacting enzymes like Glutation-S-transferase and the biomarker Acetyl cholinesterase. At the population level. we recorded a decrease in survival and fecundity. in particular. when ash concentration exceeded 8 mg/L. we observed that individuals did not reach adulthood. At the ecosystem level. we recorded a significant decrease of the intermediate trophic level (primary consumers) although producers were positively enhanced by the eruption. The absence of these primary consumers may affect upper trophic levels like fishes.

L.) in relation to available soil water and weather conditions during the growing seasons 2012 and 2013. The objective was to examine how soil water potential affects growth and transpiration of a mature beech stand situated at the lower distributional limit of beech in Slovakia. To be able to evaluate beech response to soil water shortage. we irrigated a group of 6 trees during the period of pronounced drought. while the control group of other 6 trees remained exposed to actual weather conditions. Mean air temperatures of both seasons were considerably above the long-term average and the temporal pattern of precipitation differed between the years. During the whole growing season 2012. beech samples transpired an average volume of 6.9 m3 of water in the control and 7.7 m3 in the irrigated group. A slightly higher average volume was found in the growing season 2013 under both treatments (7.7 m3 in control and 10.5 m3 in irrigated trees). In the drought period 2012. when the irrigation experiment was commenced. the sap flow in the control group was reduced by 30% as compared with the irrigated group. In 2013. a 38.1% difference in sap flow was observed between the groups. Sap flow in the non-irrigated trees decreased with reducing soil moisture. and ceased at soil water potential -0.6 MPa.

Using chamber method we estimated the main ecosystem carbon fluxes: ecosystem CO2 efflux (respiration. Re) and assimilation (gross photosynthetic production. GPP). We identified soil temperature. soil moisture and photosynthetically active radiation respectively. as the controlling factors for CO2 fluxes. Statistically sound regressions among CO2 fluxes and instant microclimate values were extrapolated across the season using continuously measured values by on-site located automatic weather stations. Spatial upscaling from the point-wise to the landscape-wise scales was based on regressions between C fluxes and microsite and/or vegetation conditions.

We investigated the state of three disturbed spruce stands along an altitudinal gradient in Tatra National Park (Slovakia) through various physiological processes. Tree-growth characteristics. the mineral nutrition in the needles. and photosynthetic efficiency were assessed. Two techniques of chlorophyll a fluorescence and analyses of assimilatory pigments were used to detect the changes in photosynthesis functioning. Also. the heat sensitivity of photosystem II was tested. Our results showed that these stands are located in nutrient-poor environments. We recorded similar contents of nitrogen. phosphorus. potassium. sodium. zinc. and iron in all stands. Down the vertical transect. the contents of calcium. magnesium. and manganese significantly decreased and the non-essential aluminium increased. Based on stem circumference measurements. water deficit occurred during the vegetation season in all stands. but with the smallest magnitude highest U–stand.

This study addresses the model results of Phytotoxic Ozone Dose metric (POD) based on estimation of stomatal O3 flux to dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra). We focused on two different bioclimatic regions: (1) the temperate mountain forests in the High Tatra Mts (SK–HT) of the Western Carpathians. and (2) the Mediterranean forests of the Alpes–Mercantour (FR–Alp) in the Alpes–Maritimes. Field measurement of O3 concentration and meteorological data incorporated into deposition model DO3SE showed lower O3 flux in FR–Alp than in SK–HT plots for the 2016 growing season. Model outputs showed that soil humidity play a key role in stomatal O3 uptake by montane pines at the alpine timberline. We found that temperate climatic conditions in SK–HT with sufficient precipitation did not limit stomatal conductivity and O3 uptake of P. mugo and P. cembra. On the other hand. the Mediterranean mountain climate characterised by warm and dry summer reduced stomatal conductance of pines in FR–Alp. POD without threshold limitation i.e. POD0 as a recently developed biologically sounded O3 metric varied near around and below critical level (CLef) depending upon different conditions of sunshine exposure in SK–HT plots.

This research aims to determine (1) the effect of the combination of coconut water and sago wastewater as substrate for bacterial inoculum. and (2) the effect of the combination of coconut water and sago wastewater for bacterial cellulose production. This research was conducted with Completely Randomized Design (CRD) consisting of five treatments: SK1 (100% coconut water). SK2 (75% coconut water+ 25% sago wastewater). SK3 (50% coconut water+ 50% sago wastewater). SK4 (25% coconut water+ 75% sago wastewater). and SK5 (100% sago wastewater). Each treatment consisted of 3 replications. The parameters measured were optical density of inoculum culture. fresh and dry weight of bacterial cellulose. and the thickness of bacterial cellulose. The results showed that the combination of coconut water and sago wastewater as substrate had an effect on inoculum quality and bacterial cellulose production. Treatment SK3 with a combination of 50% coconut water and 50% sago wastewater was the best substrate for bacterial inoculum with optical density value 0.59. The same medium was the best for bacterial cellulose production based on the thickness (1.02 cm) and weight of bacterial cellulose (443.33 g for fresh weight).,True,Ti2YXq0AAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://proceeding.iconss.id/ips/article/view/44,,,,https://proceeding.iconss.id/ips/article/download/44/14,0,0,0

Amblyosyllis is a monophyletic genus easy to identify due to its distinct diagnostic features; however. the species and their boundaries are. in most cases. not well defined. Herein. we provide an extensive sample of Amblyosyllis material (115 specimens) from several world geographic areas. We have studied the morphological features of each specimen and photographed them alive. Two mitochondrial DNA markers (COI and 16S) and one nuclear gene fragment (28S. D1 region) were sequenced. We performed phylogenetic analyses based on each DNA partition. as well as the combined data sets. obtaining congruent results. Species delimitation methods such as distance analyses. statistical parsimony networks and multi-rate Poisson tree processes were also applied. The combined results obtained from different methodologies and data sets are used to differentiate between. at least. 19 lineages compatible with the separately evolving meta-populations species concept. Four of these lineages are identified as nominal species. including the type species of Amblyosyllis. A. rhombeata.

A minimal ubiquitylation pathway uses a three-enzyme cascade (E1. E2. and E3) to activate Ub and select target proteins for modification. Although diverse E3 families provide much of the target specificity. several factors have emerged recently that coordinate the subcellular localization of the ubiquitylation machinery. Here. we show that the family of membrane-anchored ubiquitin-fold (MUB) proteins recruits and docks specific E2s to the plasma membrane.

Apterous aphids were fed on pospiviroid-infected plants and viroid targets in the aphids were consequently quantified through RT-qPCR and localized within the aphid body using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Based on the analytical sensitivity test. the limit of detection (LOD) was estimated at 1.69 × 106 viroid copies per individual aphid body. To localize the viroids in the aphids. a pospiviroid-generic Cy5-labelled probe was used and the fluorescent signal was determined by confocal microscopy. Viroids were clearly observed in the aphid's stylet and stomach. but not in the embryos. Viroids were detected in 29% of the aphids after a 24 h feeding period. which suggests only a partial and low concentration viroid uptake by the aphid population including viroid concentrations under the LOD.

1076865,Viroid-insect-plant interactions in view of transmission routes,2016,Noémi Van Bogaert,,,,,,Since the discovery of the Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd. Diener 1971). researchers all over the globe have investigated the unique molecular and epidemiological features of viroids. Viroids are small. non-protein encoding. single-stranded RNAs that replicate autonomously in plants. They are classified into two families. the Avsunviroidae and the Pospiviroidae. which is most prevalent in Europe. Trending topics in viroid research during the past decades were: viroid replication. molecular and biochemical features of viroids. RNA-silencing. host range and transmission mechanisms. Less investigated topics were those related to the interaction with insects and weeds. and the potential occurrence of transencapsidation by plant viruses. This PhD therefore aimed to elucidate several aspects of the pathogen-vector-host triangle. A first goal was to investigate the role of weeds as potential reservoirs for pospiviroids. Secondly. the importance of insects in the pospiviroid spread was studied during several transmission experiments. Finally. the transmission pathway of “transencapsidation” in the luteovirus Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) was investigated for two pospiviroid species.,True,_HFUbyIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8203764,17333048772319117515,/scholar?cites=17333048772319117515,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8203764/file/8203765,0,0,0

Bull,9,3622-3628,,Verticillium wilt (VW) is a major disease in all the olive producing countries and leads to extensive losses of production and olive trees. There is not chemical treatment available currently for this pathogen and only preventive cultivation measures can be applied. In Greece. the most sensitive cultivars to VW infection are Chondrolia (Chalkidiki) and Amfissa (Fthiotida. Central Greece). Previous studies showed that remote sensing can be used to assess VW infection levels using spectral indices. such as the Carotenoid Reflectance Index 2 (CRI2) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). which depict the non-visible and visible stages of the infection. respectively. suggesting a timely and area wide method to map the status and spread of the pathogen in fields grown with Chondrolia cultivar in Chalkidiki. In the same area. experimental and also commercial applications of a new Plant Growth Enhancer Formulation (PGEF) comprising of natural minerals and biological control agents provided clear visual field evidence that infected trees can be brought back in full productivity. The present work assessed the effect of the application of the PGEF on the spectral properties of the trees. The results showed that the application had a significant effect on the recovery of the olive trees. as expressed by the change in the NDVI rate of the treated trees compared to the untreated in two successive years.

For two consecutive cultivation years. the trees were sampled on different dates and then analysed for their fruits’ radical scavenging activity (DPPH) and Folin–Ciocalteu (FCR) reducing capacity. Multispectral images from unmanned aerial vehicles were acquired on the same dates with fruit sampling. Soil samples were collected throughout the study fields at the end of the season. Topographic. hydrographic and weather data also were included in modelling. First-year data were used for model-fitting. whereas second-year data for testing. Spatial autocorrelation tests indicated unbiased sampling and. moreover. allowed restriction of modelling input parameters to a smaller group. The optimum model employs 24 input variables resulting in a 6.74 root mean square error. Provided that soil profiles and other ancillary data are known in advance of the cultivation season. capturing drone images in critical growth phases. together with contemporary weather data. can support site-and time-specific harvesting. It could also support site-specific treatments (precision farming) for improving fruit quality in the long-term. with analogous marketing perspectives.

The vascular tissues of the olive trees become plugged due to the mycelium growth. and thus the water movement from the roots to the canopy is restricted. This causes calcium deprivation of the infected tissue and finally discoloration of the periphery of the leaf lamina. At advanced stages of the infection the newer leaves roll downwards or inwards and progressively become greenishgrey to brown. This study assessed hyperspectral and thermal canopy reflectance with the use of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and spaceborne multi-spectral very high-resolution remote sensing provided by the WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite for the detection of Verticillium wilt. The results show that the early stages of the infection. as determined by a new eleven-point calibration scale of the disease. were better differentiated by a leaf carotenoid index (CRI2). Despite that the UAV provided images with higher spatial resolution. both the hyperspectral CRI2 imagery and the satellite multispectral CRI2 showed great sensitivity in differentiating the levels of infection (p< 0.001).

1076885,Hidden Diversity In Aquatic Habitats: Lessons From Cryptic Species In Microscopic Invertebrates (rotifera),2018,Azar Kordbacheh,,,,,,Speciation is a continuous and adaptive process by which lineages are diverged into multiple groups. and species are the product of this process. Taxonomy is the study of relationship between organisms. classifying and naming them. and one of the taxonomical challenges is delimiting species boundaries. Species delimitation can be controversial because biologists do not agree on species concepts and approaches for defining species boundaries. One of the well-known species concepts is the Biological Species Concept that requires studying reproductive barriers among populations. Investigating strength of reproductive isolation among populations is not always practical in the wild. Therefore. many biologists have used morphological traits as an indicator of reproductive isolation and for delineating species. Yet. morphological methods are not fully effective in defining species boundaries and detecting species diversity. since some species are morphologically identical. Molecular analyses have contributed to species delimitation for morphologically indistinguishable groups (cryptic species). Species that are delimited based on molecular methods have been further tested using multiple complementary approaches (integrative taxonomy) such as ecological. behavioral and morphological differentiation especially for groups such as microorganisms that show high morphological uniformity.,True,0Vx3RnsAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://scholarworks.utep.edu/open_etd/1464/,,,,https://scholarworks.utep.edu/open_etd/1464/,0,0,0

Data on 633 strandings were obtained from monitoring of a 35-km long area of the south coast of the Sea of Azov in 1999–2013. A distinct peak of strandings fell in July and August: it depended on the bycatch peak and calving season. Stranding rates depended neither on weather conditions nor on the seasonal fishing activities (including IUU fisheries). Moreover. stranding peaks in the neighbouring Black Sea were also tied to the calving season rather than to the fishing activities.

In the north-eastern Black Sea samples. both present-day and old-time. the sexual dimorphism of the skull size was not significant. whereas in the Sea of Azov the females were significantly larger than males. The Azov skulls were strongly different from those from the Black Sea: they were larger. proportionally wider and had the wider rostra; also. there was no significant chronological variation within the Black Sea.

A clear example of a plant-derived biofuel resource is the sugar cane bagasse exhibiting 60 % - 80 % of fermentable sugars in its composition. However. the current methods of plant bioconversion employ severe and harmful chemical/physical pretreatments raising biofuel cost production and environmental degradation. Replacing these methods with co-cultivated enzymatic cocktails is an alternative. Here we propose a pretreatment for sugarcane bagasse using a multi-enzymatic cocktail from the co-cultivation of four Aspergillus nidulans recombinant strains. The co-cultivation resulted in the simultaneous production of GH51 arabinofuranosidase (AbfA). GH11 endo-1.4-xylanase (XlnA). GH43 endo-1.5-arabinanase (AbnA) and GH12 xyloglucan specific endo-β-1.4-glucanase (XegA). This core set of recombinant enzymes was more efficient than the alternative alkaline method in maintaining the cellulose integrity and exposing this cellulose to the following saccharification process. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis revealed residual byproducts on the alkali pretreated biomass. which were not found in the enzymatic pretreatment. Therefore. the enzymatic pretreatment was residue-free and seemed to be more efficient than the applied alkaline method. which makes it suitable for bioethanol production.,True,tX_kwjYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,17,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00583/full,9728001237911461534,/scholar?cites=9728001237911461534,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00583/full,0,0,0

Telomeres. the caps that protect the end of linear chromosomes. are known to shorten with age. inducing cell senescence and aging. Furthermore. differences in age-related telomere attrition were established between short-lived and long-lived organisms. However. whether telomere length is a “biological thermometer” that reflects the biological state at a certain point in life or a biomarker that can influence biological conditions. delay senescence and promote longevity is still an ongoing debate. We cross-sectionally tested telomere length in different tissues of two long-lived (naked mole-rat and Spalax) and two short-lived (rat and mice) species to tease out this enigma. While blood telomere length of the naked mole-rat (NMR) did not shorten with age but rather showed a mild elongation. telomere length in three tissues tested in the Spalax declined with age. just like in short-lived rodents. These findings in the NMR. suggest an age buffering mechanism. while in Spalax tissues the shortening of the telomeres are in spite of its extreme longevity traits. Therefore. using long-lived species as models for understanding the role of telomeres in longevity is of great importance since they may encompass mechanisms that postpone aging.

1076914,The epigenetic regulation of telomere maintenance in aging,2018,Huda Adwan-Shekhidem and Gil Atzmon,,,,119-136,Academic Press,Aging is a complex process influenced by a combination of genetic. epigenetic. and environmental factors. Genetic components donate almost 30% of the aging phenotypic variance. while epigenetic modifications that serve as environment X gene mediator are considered to be the major contributors. Epigenetic modifications (i.e.. DNA methylation and histone modifications) can affect the gene expression and genomic stability and thus underlie age-associated diseases. Another mechanism found to be involved (may serve as a biomarker) with aging process is telomere attrition. Cellular telomeres shorten with age until a critical length. which results in a vital genomic material loss. thus triggering the cell to enter replicative senescence. This attrition is compensated by telomerase activity that maintains telomere length and support cell proliferation.

TN (United States),With the diminishing supply of the world’s petroleum reserves and increasing environmental concerns. a heightened focus has been placed upon developing bio refineries to sustainably convert lignocellulosics to fuels. chemicals and materials. Furthermore. woody biomass represents a promising bio resource due to its abundance. renewability. and biodegradability. Lignin is an irregular polyphenolic macromolecule that typically constitutes~ 15-35% of woody biomass. The pulp and paper industry produces lignin on the scale of millions of tons each year as a by-product of the pulping process. Traditionally. lignin has been viewed as a waste material that is combusted in the pulping process. But. in recent decades. there have been increased efforts devoted towards the conversion of lignin into value-added commodities. such as bio fuels. biomaterials. and bio-based chemicals. The valorization of lignin can be regarded as a necessary step for the development of lignocellulosic-based integrated bio refineries. Owing to the phenolic structure of lignin. it is possible to enzymatically graft molecules onto its surface using laccases (benzenediol: oxygen oxidoreductases. EC 1.10. 3.2) to create exciting novel biomaterials. These environmentally friendly enzymes use oxygen as their only co-substrate and produce water as their sole by-product. and as a result have found compelling industrial applications.

Heidelberg,This article describes a bio-inspired system and the associated series of experiments. for the evolution of walking behavior in a simulated humanoid robot. A previous study has demonstrated the potential of this approach for evolving controllers based on simulated humanoid robots with a restricted range of movements. The development of anthropomorphic bipedal locomotion is addressed by means of artificial evolution using a genetic algorithm. The proposed task is investigated using full rigid-body dynamics simulation of a bipedal robot with 15 degrees of freedom. Stable bipedal gait with a velocity of 0.94 m/s is realized. Locomotion controllers are evolved from scratch. for example neither does the evolved controller have any a priori knowledge on how to walk. nor does it have any information about the kinematics structure of the robot. Instead. locomotion control is achieved based on intensive use of …,True,5HsCZRkAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,13,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-22907-7_9,11753504491368629128,/scholar?cites=11753504491368629128,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noureddine_Djedi/publication/226323984_Gait_Evolution_for_Humanoid_Robot_in_a_Physically_Simulated_Environment/links/560abee508ae1396914cdd03.pdf,0,0,0

In this system. surviving bacteria have to overcome the problems of detecting resources (or sensing the environment). modulating their motion to generate a foraging behavior. and communicating with their kin to produce more sophisticated behaviors. A cell’s chemotactic pathway is modulated by a hybrid approach that uses an algebraic model for the receptor clusters activity. an ordinary differential equation for the adaptation dynamics. and a metabolic model that converts nutrients into biomass. The results show some analysis of the motion obtained from some bacteria and their effects on the evolved population behavior. The evolutionary process improves the bacteria’s ability to react to their environment. enhancing their growth and allowing them to better survive.

1076952,Emergent group behaviors from bacteria quorum sensing simulation,2016,Nesrine Ouannes and N Djedi and Yves Duthen and Herve Luga,,21st AROB,,62-67,,The quorum sensing (QS) is the mechanism that bacteria use to communicate together. This communication allows bacteria to coordinate their behaviors. and allows colonies behaviors to emerge in various environments. Here. the bacteria cells grow exponentially according to our previous model of simulated bacteria chemotaxis [1. 2]. Then. the communication between bacteria is guaranteed according to the proposed algorithm of quorum sensing acting at cellular level. Quorum Sensing helps groups of bacteria to act synchronously in a simulated environment with limited resources. A molecular exchange is used in our previous model to simulate bacteria chemotaxis [1. 2]; the surviving bacteria have to overcome the problems of detecting resources (or sensing the environment). and modulating their motion to generate a foraging behavior. This paper presents a simulation of a growth system and communication between bacteria that are living in a virtual environment. starting by simulating the individual bacteria behaviors such as growth. division and communication with each other and with the environment. This quorum sensing process plays a major role in:(a) colonial behavior of bacterial populations (or multicellular behavior emergence). allowing the interaction between bacteria of the same species depending on the population density;(b) the control of cell population density;(c) changes in behavior that are triggered by the molecules when a quorum is present; These molecules migrate from one cell to another cell. that is close proximity (ie area detection); the bacterial communities are formed and subsequent synchronization mechanisms …,True,5HsCZRkAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noureddine_Djedi/publication/292145144_Emergent_group_behaviors_from_bacteria_quorum_sensing_simulation/links/56aa4cc108aef6e05df45c2f/Emergent-group-behaviors-from-bacteria-quorum-sensing-simulation.pdf,15241254844399431465,/scholar?cites=15241254844399431465,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noureddine_Djedi/publication/292145144_Emergent_group_behaviors_from_bacteria_quorum_sensing_simulation/links/56aa4cc108aef6e05df45c2f/Emergent-group-behaviors-from-bacteria-quorum-sensing-simulation.pdf,0,0,0

Despite a fertilization rate after insemination (AI) of approximately 90%. calving rates are 30%–50%. indicating the occurrence of extensive embryonic and foetal losses. The aim of this study was to establish the extent and pattern of embryonic and foetal loss in Swedish Red (SR) and Swedish Holstein (SH) dairy cows. as well as. the relationship to oestrus intensity (OI) and progesterone (P4) concentration. In total. 2130 AIs and 16.176 milk P4 samples from 359 SR and 212 SH dairy cows were included in the study. Pregnancy losses were estimated using data from P4 values combined with AI information and calving data. Total pregnancy loss from AI to the day of calving was 65%. Early embryonic loss. late embryonic loss and foetal loss were estimated to be 29. 14 and 13%. respectively. There is strong evidence in the literature that P4 concentrations at different time points are associated with pregnancy loss. In the present study. cows with pregnancy losses had significantly higher P4 levels at the day of AI and significantly lower P4 concentration at days 10. 21 and 30 after AI compared to pregnant cows. Swedish Red cows had significantly lower total pregnancy losses compared to SH cows (62% and 68% respectively. P = 0.017). Early embryonic loss was 6.7% points lower for cows inseminated at a stronger OI (OI = 3) compared to at a weaker OI (OI = 2. P = 0.006).

1076962,Can Swedish beef production become profitable by learning from Canadian beef production?,2009,Sofia Nyman,290,,,,SLU. Dept. of Animal Environment and Health,To make Swedish beef production more profitable and sustainable. even without subsidies. there is a need to find alternative production systems to reduce the cost of production. One way to find cheaper solutions for Swedish beef production is to learn from beef producers in other countries and regions with similar natural conditions as Sweden. Western Canada has a good and large scale cow-calf production and finishing of calves. and Peace River Region (PRR) in British Columbia (BC) has similar natural conditions as Central Swedish Flatlands (CSF). Alberta. where most calves from PRR are finished. and PRR are used as study regions for finding cheaper beef production systems than present in Sweden. How to reduce Swedish costs are investigated by comparing PRR and CSF budgets for cow-calf operations as well as Albertan and CSF budgets for finishing beef cattle. For CSF. budgets from the Swedish University of Agricultural Science are used. One important reason for the low costs of beef production in western Canada is outdoor wintering of the cows and finishing of young cattle in open feedlots. In order to more closely study the possibilities of introducing Canadian production systems in Sweden; natural conditions. history and especially present production systems in western Canada. cow-calf operations in PRR. feedlots in Alberta and a museum were visited.    Swedish beef production is characterized by high costs of production caused by small herd sizes. relatively high labour costs. high demands on buildings. short vegetation period and lack of large and connected pastures.

Traditionally genetic evaluations for fertility have been based on measures on insemination- and calving dates. which in general are highly influenced by on-farm decisions. Unfortunately. the low heritability of classical fertility traits makes the genetic improvement slow. This thesis aims to provide information useful for a genetic evaluation utilising progesterone (P4) based fertility traits having higher heritability. and by using genomic information to try to identify genetic markers associated with fertility. The aim was also to investigate the characteristics of oestrous expression. pregnancy losses and their phenotypic relationships to P4 profiles as future potential traits included in breeding evaluation. Progesterone data from two data sets were used in the analyses: in Papers I and II from Swedish Red (SR) and Swedish Holstein (SH) dairy cows. and in Papers III and IV from Holstein-Friesian cows from four different countries. Swedish Red cows had higher conception rate. more intensive oestruses and longer oestrus durations compared to SH cows. irrespectively housing systems. Conception rate was found to increase with stronger oestrus intensity (OI). from 24% for with weaker and more uncertain oestrous symptoms. e.g. red and swollen vulva. to 54% for primary oestrous symptoms. e.g. standing.

1076970,Synaptic democracy and vesicular transport in axons,2015,Paul C Bressloff and Ethan Levien,114,Physical review letters,16,168101,American Physical Society,Synaptic democracy concerns the general problem of how regions of an axon or dendrite far from the cell body (soma) of a neuron can play an effective role in neuronal function. For example. stimulated synapses far from the soma are unlikely to influence the firing of a neuron unless some sort of active dendritic processing occurs. Analogously. the motor-driven transport of newly synthesized proteins from the soma to presynaptic targets along the axon tends to favor the delivery of resources to proximal synapses. Both of these phenomena reflect fundamental limitations of transport processes based on a localized source. In this Letter. we show that a more democratic distribution of proteins along an axon can be achieved by making the transport process less efficient.

Is there an explicit relationship between observables obtained from a single lineage and the population growth rate? We show that a population’s growth rate can be represented in terms of averages over isolated lineages.

In this paper we investigate how such correlations depend on the form of environmental noise by considering a simple birth–death process with dynamical disorder in the birth rate. In particular. we derive expressions for the second-order statistics of two birth–death processes evolving in the same noisy environment.

In this study we consider stochastic models of biochemical networks evolving in the presence of dynamic random environments. These environments are themselves modeled as chemical reaction networks so that the full system can be viewed as a multiscale chemical reaction network. The multiscale structure arises from the fact that the environment and the internal system may operate on different timescales. While previous results in chemical reaction network theory have established that certain dynamic behavior can be ruled out when a topological parameter. known as the network deficiency. is zero. these results fail to capture the behavior that can be observed in multiscale networks.

The statistics of the piecewise deterministic process can be obtained much more efficiently than those of the exact process. We explore the possibility of coupling sample paths of the exact model to the piecewise deterministic process in order to reduce the variance of their difference. We then apply this coupling to reduce the computational complexity of a Monte Carlo estimator. Motivated by the rigorous results in [1]. we show how this method can be applied to realistic biological models with nontrivial scalings.,True,hshuLN4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999117304436,9509514203607125583,/scholar?cites=9509514203607125583,,http://www.math.utah.edu/~bresslof/publications/17-5.pdf,0,0,0

Matsumoto H and Saito F,39,J Toxicol Sci.,5,725-34,,Carcinogenicity is one of the most serious toxic effects of chemicals. and highly accurate methods for predicting carcinogens are strongly desired for human health. Here. we developed a new prediction system named “CARCINOscreen®” for evaluating the carcinogenic potentials of chemicals using the gene expression profiles of liver tissues from rats after a 28-day repeated dose toxicity study. The prediction formula was generated using a support vector machine with predictive genes selected from 68 training chemical datasets; a predictive score was then calculated to predict the carcinogenic potentials of the tested chemicals. To ensure the accuracy of the prediction system. the chemicals were divided into three groups (Groups 1 to 3) according to the resulting hepatic gene expression profiles. and a prediction formula was generated for each group. The prediction system was capable of predicting the carcinogenicity of training carcinogens and non-carcinogens with an accuracy of 92.9% to 100%. The final prediction result was determined based on the maximum prediction value obtained with three independent prediction formulas to build up the CARCINOscreen®.

1076998,The effects of salinization on freshwater fishes of the Northern Great Plains,2017,Zachary Hoover,,,,,,Salinization poses a threat to many inland aquatic ecosystems. Therefore. it is important to understand the potential implications of salinization on aquatic systems. Saline water bodies are prevalent in the Northern Great Plains of North America—an area that includes portions of Alberta. Saskatchewan. and several northern states in the United States. In this area. saline water bodies provide an environmentally important habitat for a variety of species. Salinization. both natural and anthropogenic. is predicted to increase in the Northern Great Plains in the future. but the potential effects on aquatic organisms remain largely unknown. To investigate these potential impacts. I first established lethal levels of salinity exposure in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). northern pike (Esox lucius). and walleye (Sander vitreus). This experiment also gave me a framework for determining relevant concentrations with which to test the effects of sub-lethal salinity exposure on fathead minnows. After deciding appropriate levels. I exposed minnows to one of three sub-lethal salinity concentrations crossed by one of three alarm cue concentrations—an indicator of imminent predation risk.

X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) acts as a dosage compensation mechanism that equalizes X-linked genes expression between homo- and heterogametic sexes. However. approximately 12-23% of X-linked genes escape from XCI. being bi-allelic expressed. Herein. we report on genetic and functional data from an asymptomatic female of a Fragile X syndrome family. who harbors a large deletion on the X-chromosome. Array-CGH uncovered that the de novo. terminal. paternally originated 32 Mb deletion on Xq25-q28 spans 598 RefSeq genes. including escape and variable escape genes. Androgen receptor (AR) and retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) methylation assays showed extreme skewed XCI ratios from both peripheral blood and buccal mucosa. silencing the abnormal X-chromosome. Surprisingly. transcriptome-wide analysis revealed that escape and variable escape genes spanning the deletion are mostly upregulated on the active X-chromosome. precluding major clinical/cognitive phenotypes in the female. Metaphase high count. hemizygosity concordance for microsatellite markers and monoallelic expression of genes within the deletion suggest the absence of mosaicism in both blood and buccal mucosa.

This sex bias can be attributed to the enrichment of genes on the X chromosome playing essential roles in the central nervous system and their hemizygous state on males. Moreover. as a result of X chromosome inactivation (XCI). most genes on one of the X chromosomes in female somatic cells are epigenetically silenced. so that females carrying X-linked variants are not expected to be so severely affected as males. Consequently. the knowledge about X-linked ID (XLID) in females is still scarce. Herein. we used extreme XCI skewing (≥ 90%) to predict X-linked variants in females with idiopathic ID.

IK International Publishing House Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi",,319-341,,Microbes sustain life on earth living in complex communities. Metagenomics is considered an emerging “omics” technology to be able to address the research of these communities. The world metagenomics derives from meta which in Greek means to transcend or to go beyond. The final goal of this science is to go beyond individual genes and genomes in any specific environmental sample. enabling scientists to study all of the genomes in a community as a whole. This chapter will help to acquire basic knowledge on the new science of metagenomics as one of the emerging “omics” technology as well as to familiarize with the techniques and possible impacts of this field. The importance of studying microbial communities is discussed at the beginning to understand the importance they play in regulating different global processes. Our knowledge on microbial communities’ composition is very poor and it is limited by our ability to grow microorganisms in vitro. We can culture less than 1% of the microorganisms. and this is why metagenomics is so important to understand microbial communities. Metagenomic approaches allow obtaining genetic information from organisms that otherwise cannot be studied. The chapter analyzes different metagenomic projects. which involve massive sequencing technology. different methodological approaches and functional genetic screenings. These model projects will help the reader to become familiar with the techniques and will understand the potential impact and applications of metagenomics in diverse fields with a special emphasis in biotechnological applications.,True,qdCrtZYAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,3,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=g4bWIgCYZKEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA319&dq=info:ZpfNde5bP00J:scholar.google.com&ots=SFdfp3XoK4&sig=bWqGVw-_2gnj6ISZM_IRn8qny80,5566268744189974374,/scholar?cites=5566268744189974374,,,0,0,0

1077029,Unimodal effects of pigment richness on niche and fitness differences explain species richness and ecosystem function in light-limited phytoplankton communities,2020,Jurg Werner Spaak and Frederik DeLaender,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Trait diversity is traditionally seen as promoting species richness and ecosystem function. Species with dissimilar traits would partition available resources. increasing niche differences. facilitating coexistence and increasing ecosystem function. Here we first show. using theory and simulations for light-limited phytoplankton. that combing photosynthetic pigments is indeed  a necessary condition for coexistence and stimulates ecosystem function. However. pigment richness does mostly not permit the coexistence of more than two species. and increases productivity at most  60% compared to single-pigment communities. Surprisingly. combining all nine pigments known to date leads to a 2.5% probability that four species would coexist. illustrating that the coexistence of a high number of species along a continuous niche axis is constrained by limiting similarity. We explain these constraints by unimodal effects of pigment richness on niche and fitness differences. which jointly limit the positive effect of pigment on species richness. Empirical data and additional simulations suggest that pigment richness effects can be stronger during transient dynamics but inevitably weaken with time. i.e. pigment richness effects on species richness and function are likely short-lived.

Coexistence theory presents the persistence of species amidst heterospecifics as a balance between niche differences and fitness differences that favour and hamper coexistence. respectively. With most applications focusing on species pairs. we know little about how niche and fitness differences respond to species richness. i.e. what constraints richness most. We present analytical proof that. in absence of higher-order interactions. the average fitness difference increases with richness. while the average niche difference stays constant. Analysis of a simple model with higher-order interactions. extensive simulations that relaxed all assumptions. and analyses of empirical data. confirmed these results. Our work thus shows that fitness differences. not niche difference. limit species richness.

1077036,A Custom GPS Recording System for Improving Operational Performance of Aerially-Deployed Herbicide Ballistic Technology,2014,Roberto Rodriguez III and Daniel M Jenkins and James JK Leary and Brooke V Mahnken,,,,1,American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, Herbicide Ballistic Technology (HBT) is an electro-pneumatic delivery system designed for administering 17.3 mm herbicide-filled projectiles (e.g. paintballs) to visually-acquired weed targets. Currently. HBT is being deployed from a Hughes 500D helicopter platform in aerial surveillance operations to eliminate satellite invasive weed populations in remote natural watershed areas of Maui (Hawaii. USA). Coordination and analysis of control operations require that the site of each HBT application be recorded with a handheld GPS data logger.

1077037,Characterizing the suitable habitat of Miconia calvescens in the East Maui Watershed,2021,N Jorgensen and J Leary and M Renz and B Mahnken,12,Management of Biological Invasions,,,,The East Maui Watershed (EMW) is a> 60.000-ha forested watershed with wide temperature and precipitation gradients being invaded by miconia (Miconia calvescens DC.). Current miconia management efforts focus on protecting important watershed and critical habitat areas from miconia invasion. Herein. we report on a miconia species distribution model to predict unoccupied areas that may be still vulnerable to invasion. This suitable habitat model was developed from an ensemble of five algorithms associating five physical features of EMW with miconia occurrence data from a 26-yr management history (1991–2016; n= 114.953). All of the algorithms performed well based on model evaluation statistics (eg AUC≥ 0.83; TSS≥ 0.36). Elevation. slope and rainfall were consistently important predictors. while aspect indices were non-contributors. The binary ensemble model suggests a total of~ 56.9% of the area of interest is susceptible to invasion by miconia. An independent dataset collected in 2017–2018 (n= 5.222) was used to field validate the ensemble habitat suitability model (EHSM) and found that the model could correctly predict suitable habitat 94% of the time. All five of the model algorithms were updated using this new management data. and the predicted suitable area decreased 2.3%. While binary models are useful for risk assessment. the classification of an area as suitable or not suitable has limitations for land managers adopting for management activities. Utilizing the mean weighted consensus probability surface representation of the model allows for more scrutiny of potential suitable habitat.

Evolutionary origin of Hox genes and primary body axis predate the divergence of Bilateria and Cnidaria. However. function of Cnidarian Hox-like genes and their regulation in axis determination is obscure due to studies limited to a few representative model systems. Present investigation is conducted using Hydra. a Hydrozoan member of phylum Cnidaria. to gain insights into the roles of Cnidarian Hox-like genes in primary axis formation.

Here. we characterized the Wnt signalling regulatory network involved in formation of the head organizer. We found that Wnt signalling regulates genes that are important in tissue morphogenesis. We identified that majority of transcription factors (TFs) regulated by Wnt/β-catenin signalling belong to the homeodomain and forkhead families. Silencing of Margin. one of the Wnt regulated homeodomain TFs. results in loss of the ectopic tentacle phenotype typically seen upon activation of Wnt signalling. Furthermore. we show that the Margin promoter is directly bound and regulated by β-catenin. Ectopic expression of Margin in zebrafish embryos results in body axis abnormalities suggesting that Margin plays a role in axis patterning.

The investigation is a case study about the nature of the adiabatic organic solid-state reactions by kinetic measurements of the processes that occur during the dimerization of aromatic nitroso compounds (p-bromo- and p-iodonitrosobenzenes. respectively) in crystals. From the reaction rates at different temperatures we have calculated the activation energy. Since dimerization is induced by the appearance of crystal deformations on the surface caused by sublimation. we study here the relationship between the rate of sublimation and the rate of dimerization.

Fragaceatoxin C (FraC) is a toxin that upon binding to the surface of sphingomyelin-rich cells undergoes a structural metamorphosis. leading to the assembly of nanopores at the cell membrane and causing cell death. In this study we attached photoswitchable azobenzene pendants to various locations near the sphingomyelin binding pocket of FraC with the aim of remote controlling the nanopore assembly using light.

Structural and morphological characterization of synthesized materials were confirmed by X-ray diffractometry. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical measurements revealed that mixed NCSs exhibit pseudocapacitor behaviour and their capacitance was strongly dependent on the composition. Interestingly. the electrochemical performance of the mixed NCSs has been significantly improved in comparison to the pristine nickel sulfide or cobalt sulfide. Particularly. the mixed NCS prepared at a nickel:cobalt molar ratio of 3:1 exhibited a specific capacitance of 2599.6 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (or 1345 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1) and retained 95% of its initial capacitance after 3000 charge-discharge cycles.

In this report. SiO2/cFe3O4 colloids based on a cFe3O4 core (367 nm) and a series of silica shell thicknesses (24. 47. 91. and 134 nm) were prepared and their charge transfer resistances (Rct) and the redox reactions of Ag+/AgNP on their surfaces were investigated. The Rct values of the SiO2/cFe3O4 series increased linearly as the silica shell thickness increased. The reductive elaboration of Ag+ to AgNPs by formaldehyde on the surfaces in the SiO2/cFe3O4 series was very poorly manageable in the case of the 24 nm shell but readily controllable as the silica thickness increased.

Abalo (Brucea antidysenterica) and Olic tree (Olea europaea) were used as smoking wood. For moisture content test. 25 g of processed fish was put in an oven at 105 C and weight change of the samples was measured until the change become constant. It was calculated as the difference between the initial and final weight. Twenty-five gram of processed fish was taken aseptically and standard procedures of dilution and spread plating were done based on the type of microorganism to be identified. Then. the number of colonies were counted and changed into log 10 cfu/g. Solar tent reduced the moisture content to 20% and 23% for Nile tilapia and African catfish. respectively. Microbial load of solar tent dried fish samples was below the standard norm than open air rack and smoking methods. There was statistical difference between treatments (p= 0.05).

The two K-like phages were isolated from the Fersisi therapeutic phage mix from the Tbilisi Eliava Institute. and were designated B1 (vB_SauM_B1) and JA1 (vB_SauM_JA1). The sequence relatedness of B1 and JA1 to phage K was observed to be 95% and 94% respectively. In terms of host range on the 23 Staphylococcus isolates. B1 and JA1 infected 73.9% and 78.2% respectively. whereas K infected only 43.5%. Eleven open reading frames (ORFs) present in both phages B1 and JA1 but absent in phage K were identified by comparative genomic analysis. These ORFs were also found to be present in the genomes of phages (Team 1. vB_SauM-fRuSau02. Sb_1 and ISP) that are components of several commercial phage mixtures with reported wide host ranges.

Folsomia candida. is widely used in soil ecotoxicology. In recent years. growth rate of collembolans has become as frequently used endpoint as reproduction rate in ecotoxicological studies. However. measuring collembolan body sizes to estimate growth rate is a complicated and time-consuming task. Here we present a new image analysis method. which facilitates and accelerates the body length measurement of the collembolan Folsomia candida. The new software package. called CollScope. consists of three elements: 1) an imaging device; 2) photographing software; 3) an ImageJ macro for image processing. measurement and data analysis. We give a complete description of the operation of the software. the image analyzing process and describe its accuracy and reliability. The software with a detailed usage manual is attached as Supplementary Material. We report a case study to demonstrate that the automated measurement of collembolan body sizes is highly correlated with the traditional manual measurements (estimated measuring accuracy 0.05 mm). Furthermore. we performed a dose-response ecotoxicity test using cadmium-sulfate by using CollScope as well as classical methods for size measurement. Size data measured by CollScope or manually did not differ significantly. Furthermore the new software package decreased time consumption of the measurements to 42% when tested on 35 animals.

However. insecticide effects on soil animal behaviour has remained a neglected field until now. The Trebon 30 EC is an expansively used pyrethroid insecticide in many countries. which has a broad spectrum of activity. It is recommended against pests of different vegetables. cereals. fruits. and flowers. The effect of this insecticide on the behaviour of collembola Folsomia candida has never been tested. Nevertheless. an effect is likely. because of the neurotoxic nature of the Trebon 30 EC insecticide. This study aimed to determine.(i) whether the Trebon 30 EC insecticide (active ingredient: etofenprox) prevails on the collembola F. candida locomotor activity pattern immediately after insecticide application and (ii) if there is any temporal change in the locomotor activity pattern within one hour of insecticide application. Prompt hyperactivity followed by strongly reduced locomotor activity of F. candida due to Trebon 30 EC application has been demonstrated in this study. Collembola started to run faster even when a tenfold concentration of the recommended field rate was applied. Moreover. this insecticide causes locomotor irregularity in F. candida. Chronic insecticide exposure has a negative impact on all studied locomotor traits of this collembola. resulting in a knockdown effect.,True,kHAwV7MAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,http://real.mtak.hu/93339/1/ActaZH_2018_Vol_64_4_355.pdf,2518835526160920098,/scholar?cites=2518835526160920098,,http://real.mtak.hu/93339/1/ActaZH_2018_Vol_64_4_355.pdf,0,0,0

Knowledge of basking habits. along with other biological characteristics of the species. could be important to preserve the European pond turtle. The purpose of our research was to assess the seasonal and daily basking activity of the European pond turtle. and the effects of weather parameters on sun-basking. for which no prior data exist for Hungary. Our study was carried out in the area of a dammed valley pond system at Gödöllő (Hungary) over two years. The results showed that the seasonal peak of the turtles’ basking (the highest number of observed sun-basking turtles) was in the spring. When using a finer time scale (1.5-hour intervals). we found that daily activity peaks were earlier in the spring and summer (11: 00–12: 30 h) than in autumn (12: 30–14: 00 h). Based on three measured temperatures (air temperature in shade and sunlight. water temperature). the number of basking turtles positively correlated with temperatures and varied seasonally; the optimal temperature ranges also shifted during the year. In the spring and autumn. turtles started sun-basking at lower temperatures than in the summer. We observed the narrowest optimal temperature ranges in the summer as well. Based on a Principal Component Analysis of weather parameters. low humidity and high air temperature created optimal basking conditions. whereas high humidity. and low air and water temperatures had an adverse effect.,True,kHAwV7MAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://herpetozoa.pensoft.net/article/39059/download/pdf/,2059295352572992558,/scholar?cites=2059295352572992558,,https://herpetozoa.pensoft.net/article/39059/download/pdf/,0,0,0

Mycotoxins. such as T-2 toxin or deoxynivalenol (DON) produced by Fusarium spp.. a plant pathogen mould. occur frequently in temperate climates. Folsomia candida is a mainly fungal feeding collembolan. which has a role in the regulation of the soil microbial community and humification. We hypothesized that F. candida is adapted to the secondary metabolites of the moulds; therefore. Fusarium mycotoxins do not have an effect on their feed intake and reproduction. OECD experiments were carried out with T-2 or DON-contaminated maize and baker’s yeast as an alternative food. An additional experiment was conducted without baker’s yeast as well as a food choice test. It was found that DON or T-2 toxin caused significant mortality. Severe impairment in reproduction was also observed. accompanied with mycotoxin contaminated feed refusal. Results of feed refusal themselves cannot be the cause of the low reproduction rate; instead. the mycotoxins most likely impair the embryonic development due to their DNA destructive properties. Additionally. DON and T-2 toxin caused feeding inhibition. Both mycotoxins are known to disturb the dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons. which may disturb the feeding behaviour. and both trichothecenes can cause lesions in the mouth and gut. which may also resulted feed refusal.,True,kHAwV7MAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miklos_Mezes/publication/337775724_Reproduction_inhibiting_effects_of_deoxynivalenol_or_T-2_toxin_contaminated_maize_on_Folsomia_candida_Collembola/links/5dee1320299bf10bc34c7683/Reproduction-inhibiting-effects-of-deoxynivalenol-or-T-2-toxin-contaminated-maize-on-Folsomia-candida-Collembola.pdf,7313138271770462580,/scholar?cites=7313138271770462580,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miklos_Mezes/publication/337775724_Reproduction_inhibiting_effects_of_deoxynivalenol_or_T-2_toxin_contaminated_maize_on_Folsomia_candida_Collembola/links/5dee1320299bf10bc34c7683/Reproduction-inhibiting-effects-of-deoxynivalenol-or-T-2-toxin-contaminated-maize-on-Folsomia-candida-Collembola.pdf,0,0,0

These protofilaments assemble further to form a “Z ring” at the center of prokaryotic cells. The Z ring generates a constriction force on the inner membrane and also serves as a scaffold to recruit cell wall remodeling proteins for complete cell division in vivo. One model of the Z ring proposes that protofilaments associate via lateral bonds to form ribbons; however. lateral bonds are still only hypothetical. To explore potential lateral bonding sites. we probed the surface of Escherichia coli FtsZ by inserting either small peptides or whole fluorescent proteins (FPs). Among the four lateral surfaces on FtsZ protofilaments. we obtained inserts on the front and back surfaces that were functional for cell division.

Previous studies established the monophyly of the subgenus. but the relationships between the species remained uncertain. In this study. DNA sequence data of 61 taxa of Scleria subgen. Hypoporum. where possible represented by multiple accessions from across their distributional range. were obtained for four molecular markers: the coding chloroplast marker ndhF. the chloroplast intron rps16 and the nuclear ribosomal regions ETS and ITS. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood approaches. A species tree was constructed to summarise the results. The results indicate the existence of three sections: the monotypic. pantropically occurring. Scleria sect. Lithospermae. a new section from central and south America containing two species. and Scleria sect. Hypoporum. also pantropically distributed. containing the remainder of the species of the subgenus. Relationships in the latter section are not fully resolved. However. three or four different clades can be distinguished supported by some morphological characters. Our results indicate at least six new species in Scleria sect. Hypoporum. The new section and species are described in a taxonomical treatment. Their morphology is compared with (morphologically) closely related species.,True,nVBnT3MAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203478,3171926097346543313,/scholar?cites=3171926097346543313,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203478,0,0,0

The identification of these flies is decisive in forensic casework but is hampered by difficulties in identification and the potential presence of fly larvae that have no forensic interest. The identification of forensically relevant fly species. and their discrimination from non-forensically important species is facilitated with DNA barcoding but only if a representative local reference barcode library is available. Results: We constructed a local reference library of 195 COI barcodes from 29 species of the families Calliphoridae. Fannidae. Muscidae. and Sarcophagidae from the island of La Réunion. Our results show that 1) the library contains most of the forensically relevant species of these families from the island. and 2) all fly species can be unambiguously identified with DNA barcoding using a variety of analytical methods. Two public libraries (GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD)) only allowed to identify half the number of species of these families present in La Réunion. showing that both libraries are not representative for this island fauna. Yet. nine out of the ten species with a forensic interest could be identified using both public libraries showing that. for forensic casework. the libraries prove helpful. Significance: This is the first DNA barcode reference database for the forensically important fly species of La Réunion.

We demonstrate the clandestine nature of this market where bushmeat is sold at prices at the top of the range of premium livestock and game meat.

The poor predictive value of the current biomarkers highlights the need to explore novel and innovative methods. such as epigenetics. for the discovery of new biomarkers. Cell differentiation and function of immune cells is dependent on epigenetic mechanisms. which regulate gene expression without altering the original DNA sequence. These epigenetic mechanisms are dynamic. potentially heritable. change with age. and can be regulated and influenced by environmental conditions. One of the most well-known epigenetic mechanisms is DNA methylation. which comprises the methylation of a cytosine (C) next to a guanine (G; CpG dinucleotides).

Here. we studied the methylation of two mediators of the immune response: the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) and the inhibitory receptor programmed death 1 (PD1) in naïve and memory CD8+ T cell subsets in kidney transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive medication. Both recipients experiencing an episode of acute allograft rejection (rejectors) as well as recipients without rejection (non-rejectors) were included. CpGs in the promoter regions of both IFNγ and PD1 were significantly (p < 0.001) higher methylated in the naïve CD8+ T cells compared to the memory T cell subsets. The methylation status of both IFNγ and PD1 inversely correlated with the percentage of IFNγ or PD1-producing cells. Before transplantation. the methylation status of both IFNγ and PD1 was not significantly different from healthy donors. At 3 months after transplantation. irrespective of rejection and subsequent anti-rejection therapy. the IFNy methylation was significantly higher in the differentiated effector memory CD45RA+ (EMRA) CD8+ T cells (p = 0.01) whereas the PD1 methylation was significantly higher in all memory CD8+ T cell subsets (CD27+ memory; p = 0.02: CD27− memory; p = 0.02: EMRA; p = 0.002).

The main targets of the immunosuppressive drugs tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (MPA; the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil) are T cells. It is currently unknown whether these immunosuppressive drugs have an effect on DNA methylation - an epigenetic regulator of cellular function. Here. we determined the effect of tacrolimus and MPA on DNA methylation of the gene promoter region of interferon gamma (IFNγ). a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Total T cells. naive T cells (CCR7+CD45RO-) and memory T cells (CD45RO+ and CCR7-CD45RO-) were isolated from CMV seropositive healthy controls and stimulated with α-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of tacrolimus or MPA.

Gastrulae were more sensitive to the exposure of the two nitrogen fertilisers. Moreover. the present study is the first report of a multiple tail-like structure caused by fertilisers in frog embryos. The two fertilisers also produced oedema and kinking of tail and body in both stages. This study suggests that the abnormality occurred due to interference with cell movements during gastrulation.,True,0tF6S0MAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,2,https://li01.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/tnh/article/view/193568,5920515214131662010,/scholar?cites=5920515214131662010,,https://li01.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/tnh/article/download/193568/164024,0,0,0

However. many factors including UV radiation. infection and especially the fluctuation of temperature adversely affect the East Asian Bullfrog culture. Thus. the aims of this study was to investigate the effects of water temperature changes on the survival and growth as well as oxidative stress of the H. rugulosus tadpoles. The result showed that cold shock and heat shock significantly decreased the survival rate of the tadpoles when compared to those of control groups. Cold shock at 23 C showed the highest survival rates among the cold shocked groups and the heat shock at 27 C showed the highest survival rates among the heat shocked groups. However. there was no significant difference (p> 0.05) of their body length at day 0 and day 7 among the experimental groups. Histological examination showed blood congestion and a large number of melanomacrophage and Kupffer cell in the liver tissue of tadpoles exposed to cold and heat shock when compared to those of the controls. Moreover. blood congestion was found in tadpoles exposed to the cold shock (17 C). In addition. cold and heat shock groups revealed significantly increased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in whole body of the tadpoles compared with the control group. Moreover. the level of MDA in the cold shock group was significantly greater than that in the heat shock group. The data obtained from this study will help to raise awareness of temperature shock in farm-raised frogs and others wild amphibian species.,True,0tF6S0MAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.ibd2019exhibition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P_55-61_Sornsawan.pdf,,,,https://www.ibd2019exhibition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/P_55-61_Sornsawan.pdf,0,0,0

Members of this family commonly have six pectoral fin muscles: the abductor superficialis. abductor profundus. arrector ventralis. adductor superficialis. adductor profundus. and arrector dorsalis. An additional muscle. the arrector medialis (named in this study). was discovered on the mesial side of the pectoral fin in all nine examined species of Synodus and Trachinocephalus. but is absent in all four examined species of Harpadon and Saurida. It inserts on an anterior process of the base of the mesial half of the uppermost ray and appears to have a function similar to that of the arrector ventralis in supporting the protraction of the uppermost ray and the abduction of the pectoral fin. This muscle supports the division of the synodontids into two groups (present in Synodus and Trachinocephalus vs absent in Harpadon and Saurida).

The experiment lasted 120 days. The birds were fed ad libitum on the experimental diets. Cholesterol concentration and fatty acids in plasma and egg yolk were measured monthly and bimonthly. respectively. Egg yolk cholesterol was extracted using modified Folch procedure and measured using Zak's method.results: The results showed that experimental diets had no effect on plasma cholesterol. The different levels of flax had no significant effect on egg yolk cholesterol but the presence of copper with flax at levels of 5 and 10 percent decreased cholesterol in egg yolk (mg per gram yolk) significantly (P< 0.05). The egg cholesterol (mg per egg) in the group treated with 15% flax without copper also decreased significantly (P< 0.05). The unsaturated fatty acids of egg yolk increased significantly in all experimental diets (P< 0.05). The highest ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids was observed in groups treated with 10% and 15% flax diets.DISCUSSION: This experiment showed that feeding flaxseed to laying hens can increase omega-3 fatty acids of egg yolk.,True,VuVVoRwAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,30,http://www.arya.mui.ac.ir/index.php/arya/article/view/205,15005168182233100803,/scholar?cites=15005168182233100803,,http://www.arya.mui.ac.ir/index.php/arya/article/viewFile/205/606,0,0,0

For that purpose. peptides have been added to particulate materials in an attempt to render them with antibacterial properties or to improve their osseoconductivity. For instance. competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) has been studied to decrease the division rate of Streptococcus mutans. Also. the addition of a specific short amino acid sequence peptide derived from type I collagen (P-15) to the bone substitutes has been introduced in an attempt to increase its osseoconductivity. The present study hypothesized that xenogeneic graft materials with and without CSP would present improved host-to-biomaterial response when used in combination with P-15.

A clear understanding of the role of spatiotemporal Ca2+ signalling in green algal lineages is necessary in order to understand how the Ca2+ signalling machinery has evolved in land plants. We used single‐cell imaging of Ca2+‐responsive fluorescent dyes in the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to examine the specificity of spatial and temporal dynamics of Ca2+ elevations in the cytosol and flagella in response to salinity and osmotic stress. We found that salt stress induced a single Ca2+ elevation that was modulated by the strength of the stimulus and originated in the apex of the cell. spreading as a fast Ca2+ wave.

NY,The generation of cytosolic Ca2+ signals is an early response in plants to many environmental stresses. Ca2+ transporters play a critical role in the generation of these signals and the maintenance of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. A major class of Ca2+ transporter is the Ca2+/H+ exchanger (CAX). which is almost ubiquitous throughout every domain of life but has been best characterised in higher plants. CAX transporters of Arabidopsis thaliana have been particularly well studied and have been shown to have diverse roles in vacuolar sequestration of Ca2+ and other cations. which provide an important mechanism for ion tolerance. Recent genetic studies of CAX transporters from various plant species indicate that these proteins may also play a role in the response to specific abiotic stresses. Altered sensitivity of CAX mutant plants to abiotic stresses such as salt stress and cold stress has been observed.

1077208,Calcium signalling in plants,2012,Peter D Bickerton and Jon K Pittman,,eLS,,,American Cancer Society,Ca 2+ is an important signal transduction molecule that has been shown to regulate responses to a large number of environmental stimuli in plants and control many developmental processes. These stimuli induce the formation of Ca 2+ signals within a cell. which are generated through the action of Ca 2+ release and uptake from and into internal cellular stores or the apoplast by the activity of Ca 2+ channels. pumps and exchangers. These signals take the form of elevations of Ca 2+ with specific spatio‐temporal characteristics which are thought to denote the initial stimulus and mediate an appropriate cellular response. Information is therefore hypothesised to be encoded in these signals. which are decoded and relayed to downstream gene expression regulators and protein kinases via an array of Ca 2+‐binding sensor proteins.,True,eHmw3EwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,13,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0023722,8012157824718144034,/scholar?cites=8012157824718144034,,,0,0,0

Streptomyces globisporus 1912 is a producer of the antitumor antibiotic landomycin E and new regulator of diketopiperazine nature. Comparative analysis of the obtained DNA sequences using the GenBank data allowed localization of 7 carotenoid biosynthetic crt genes of S. globisporus 1912 in one cluster. This cluster. similar to other crt clusters of different Streptomyces species. consists of two convergent operons from 4 and 3 crt genes. The high homology (93%) of the crt gene clusters of S. globisporus 1912 and S. griseus IFO 13350 was shown. Two non-punctual repeats of 21 b. p. were found in the sequence of crtY gene coding lycopene cyclase.

Previously. we developed approaches that organize omics data into a structured hierarchy of cellular components and pathways. called a “data-driven ontology.” Such hierarchies recapitulate known cellular subsystems and discover new ones. To broadly facilitate this type of modeling. we report the development of a software library called the Data-Driven Ontology Toolkit (DDOT). consisting of a Python package (https://github.com/idekerlab/ddot) to assemble and analyze ontologies and a web application (http://hiview.ucsd.edu) to visualize them. Using DDOT. we programmatically assemble a compendium of ontologies for 652 diseases by integrating gene-disease mappings with a gene similarity network derived from omics data.

Rather. the cauline bundles extend through the rhizome independently of each other. with each cauline bundle producing successive frond traces on alternating tangents. Root traces diverge from the outer surface of cauline bundles as is characteristic of solenostelic filicalean species and dictyostelic tree ferns.

Anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) are an emerging wastewater treatment technology capable of reducing the total ARGs and ARB load discharged to receiving environments compared to conventional aerobic treatment processes. While size exclusion is effective at retaining ARB and its associated intracellular ARGs. the abundance and fate of extracellular ARGs in an AnMBR effluent have not been examined. This study elucidates the effect of combined antibiotics loading (ampicillin. erythromycin. and sulfamethoxazole) on the abundance of intracellular and extracellular ARGs in an AnMBR effluent over a period of five weeks. Quantification of targeted genes revealed an overall enrichment of intracellular ARGs (iARGs) and depletion of extracellular (exARGs) in response to antibiotics addition. which suggests exARG uptake as a significant mode of horizontal gene transfer in AnMBR effluents. Comparison of the iARG and exARG abundance profiles showed a potential bias for exARG uptake located on small plasmids compared to large plasmids.Antibiotic resistance dissemination is facilitated through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. Currently. conjugation is considered to be the dominant mechanism during wastewater treatment. However. recent studies have detected high abundances of exARGs. implying that transformation may play a greater role in dissemination.

Here. sixteen dipeptidyl nitrile derivatives were synthesized. tested against CPB. and analyzed using matched molecular pairs to determine the effects of stereochemistry and p-phenyl substitution on enzyme inhibition. The compound (S)-2-(((S)-1-(4-bromophenyl)-2.2.2-trifluoroethyl)amino)-N-(1-cyanocyclopropyl)-3-phenylpropanamide (5) was the most potent CPB inhibitor (pKi = 6.82). which was also selective for human cathepsin B (pKi < 5). The inversion of the stereochemistry from S to R was more detrimental to potency when placed at the P2 position than at P3. The p-Br derivatives were more potent than the p-CH3 and p-OCH3 derivatives. probably due to intermolecular interactions with the S3 subsite.,True,yFBIN_EAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X20305503,,,,,0,0,0
1077261,Drug Metabolites: General Features and Most Applicable Analytical Methods of Studies,2020,Pedro HJ Batista and José C Quilles Jr,,Applied Microbiology: Theory & Technology,,66-80,,Drug discovery and development is a multi and interdisciplinary process that includes chemistry and biology understanding. Though. drug discovery is an expensive and time-consuming process. promoting the lack of new drugs approval in recent years. In general. most of the drugs are established based on a macromolecular target. which is vital to disease progression. However. in many cases. the mechanism of drug-macromolecular target interaction is complex and not understood. All this missed information is strongly dependent on the physicalal-chemical stability and behavior of the molecule inside the cell. which is correlated to its metabolism resistance and entrance into the cell through the cellular membrane. respectively. Thus. bioanalysis often provides enough data about these molecular characteristics and helps to figure out new information about these subjects. In this context. the study of the metabolism of parental compound plays a key role in bioanalysis and. consequently in drug discovery. For a long time. the study of metabolism represented a huge challenge in medicinal chemistry. but with the technological advancements. many powerful techniques were developed and. currently. the metabolomics fields are essential steps in the process of discovering a new drug. Herein. we briefly discuss the biological aspects of the drug metabolism. focusing on the most used analytical tools to better understand the metabolite generation. and consequently. their chemical and biological characteristics.,True,yFBIN_EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://ojs.wiserpub.com/index.php/AMTT/article/view/413,,,,http://ojs.wiserpub.com/index.php/AMTT/article/download/413/275,0,0,0

Here we present two studies that worked with volunteers to set camera traps for ecological surveys. The photographs recorded by these citizen scientists were archived and verified using the eMammal software platform. providing a professional grade. vouchered database of biodiversity records. Motivated by managers’ concern with perceived high bear activity. our first example enlisted the help of homeowners in a short-term study to compare black bear activity inside a National Historic Site with surrounding private land. We found similar levels of bear activity inside and outside the NHS. and regional comparisons suggest the bear population is typical. Participants benefited from knowing their local bear population was normal and managers refocused bear management given this new information. Our second example is a continuous survey of wildlife using the grounds of a nature education center that actively manages habitat to maintain a grassland prairie. Center staff incorporated the camera traps into educational programs. involving visitors with camera setup and picture review. Over two years and 5.968 camera-nights this survey has collected 41.393 detections of 14 wildlife species. Detection rates and occupancy were higher in open habitats compared to forest. suggesting that the maintenance of prairie habitat is beneficial to some species.

Goforth,39,Odonatologica,,225-234,,Odonates exhibit a variety of weather associated behaviours. including abandoning ponds just before storms begin. They may be able to detect changes in weather that alert them to approaching storms and allow them to escape the water’s edge before it begins to rain. E. annexum and E. boreale were observed at a Colorado marsh (USA) to determine which weather factors contributed to the weather-induced behaviours they exhibit. They were observed for 191 five-minute periods and their flight activity quantified. Weather parameters were measured during each interval to account for rapid changes in conditions. Based on results from multiple regression analysis. it is clear that light intensity is the strongest weather parameter affecting zygopteran flight activity. but temperature. wind speed. and the presence of rain are also significant. The 2 spp. exhibited pond abandonment behaviour during storms. It is likely that storms are dangerous to zygopterans and their apparent ability to detect impending storms is a survival mechanism. Alternatively. pond abandonment behaviour may be triggered by the same factors necessary to trigger roosting and the zygopterans simply return to their roosting sites during storms.,True,l3ZGT3cAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,3,https://natuurtijdschriften.nl/pub/592701,10558855049334196662,/scholar?cites=10558855049334196662,,https://natuurtijdschriften.nl/pub/592701/OJIOS2010039003004.pdf,0,0,0

Abedus herberti,2012,Christine L Goforth and Robert L Smith,83,Animal Behaviour,3,747-753,Academic Press,Abedus herberti is an aquatic bug that carries a subalar store of atmospheric air for use during submersion. When submersed. adult bugs routinely show two patterns of behaviour we call gaping and dynamic gaping. We studied these behaviours to determine when they are expressed and tested the hypothesis that the behaviours serve a respiratory function. Gaping and dynamic gaping occurred when bugs were positioned sufficiently deep in water that they could not refresh air stores without releasing their hold on the substrate and floating to the surface. Gaping and dynamic gaping occurred more frequently as water depth increased. and bugs performing these behaviours remained submersed longer than bugs that did not express these behaviours. Bugs permitted to express gaping and dynamic gaping remain submersed longer than bugs that were experimentally prevented from performing the behaviours …,True,l3ZGT3cAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000334721100563X,3370928629782285985,/scholar?cites=3370928629782285985,,,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Although giant water bugs (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae) are large. aquatic insects known for their obligate paternal egg brooding behaviors. little research has focused on the structure of their eggs. The respiratory requirements of developing embryos likely created selection for brooding. so a thorough understanding of the respiratory morphology of belostomatid eggs could help explain how brooding behaviors facilitate embryonic gas exchange. This study used scanning electron microscopy to document the respiratory microstructure of the eggs of Abedus herberti. a back brooding giant water bug. The exochorion is similar to that of other belostomatids in texture and organization except that the respiratory region is confined to the uppermost quarter of the egg.

Many teachers I have worked with report limited time to investigate a project and prepare lessons for it.

1077298,The movement behavior and reproductive ecology of western corn rootworm beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomeliae) in Bt cornfields with structured and seed blend refuges,2017,Sarah A Hughson,,,,,,In the United States. western corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae; Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte) larvae have been managed using transgenic Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner) corn hybrids expressing insecticidal Cry proteins since 2003.  To slow the evolution of resistance to Cry proteins. the Environmental Protection Agency mandated an insect resistance management (IRM) plan requiring the planting of non-Bt refuges as structured blocks or randomly distributed (seed blends) within Bt cornfields.  Refuges allow susceptible larvae to develop without exposure to Cry proteins expressed elsewhere in the field.  The modest populations of susceptible beetles from the refuge are expected to disperse across cornfields and mate with most of the rare. potentially resistant. beetles that survived Bt exposure.  These “mixed-matings” are expected to produce heterozygous Bt susceptible offspring. delaying resistance because few resistant individuals will have opportunities to mate and produce homozygous Bt resistant offspring.  Because the efficacy of the rootworm refuge strategy relies heavily on western corn rootworm movement and mating behavior. it is important to understand these behaviors in Bt cornfields.  This dissertation presents data on daily movement within Bt cornfields and details of western corn rootworm mating relevant to resistance management.  The spatial and temporal distribution of beetle mating activity and movement were measured in four refuge treatments 1) 20% structured refuge. 2) 5% structured refuge. 3) 5% seed blend refuge and 4) 0% refuge from 2010 to 2012.

1077302,Rootworm behavior and resistance in Bt cornfields,2017,Joseph L Spencer and Sarah A Hughson,,,,,,The western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte. WCR) is the most economically important US corn pest (Gray et al. 2009). Together with the northern corn rootworm (Diabrotica barberi Smith and Lawrence. NCR). it was estimated that these pests annually cost producers $1 billion in yield losses and control costs (Metcalf 1986). Today the cost is thought to be much greater (Dun et al. 2010; Tinsley et al. 2013).Corn rootworm life cycles are closely tied to that of corn (Levine and Oloumi-Sadeghi 1991). WCR eggs hatch in late May or early June. The tiny newly-emerged “neonate” larvae use the CO2 emissions from growing corn roots to locate nearby hosts. Larval root-feeding causes most of the yield losses and costs associated with this species. while the adults feed on corn foliage. tassels. silks. and kernels (Branson and Krysan 1981.

When observations and empirical data contradict the conventional wisdom. we should pay attention to the stories that the insects tell. During 20 years studying the rotation-resistant (and now Bt-resistant) western corn rootworm (WCR. Diabrotica virgifera virgiferaLeConte)(Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Illinois. my laboratory has gained an appreciation for the details of WCR local movement. mating. and dispersal. Those insights are helping us understand current management challenges posed by the most significant US pest of corn.Methods: WCR beetles were collected within and above the plant canopies of soybean and cornfields (planted with Bt or non-Bt corn hybrids) using insect nets. collection jars. and malaise traps. Analyses measured physical and reproductive characteristics of individuals and analyzed WCR gut contents to identify where adults had been feeding. The temporal context of collections. combined with information about the types of plants at collection sites. enrich the interpretation of individual characteristics and movement patterns.Results/Conclusion: Rotation-resistant WCR engage in extensive interfield movement; however. their intrafield movement patterns and distributions of mating activity in Bt cornfields fall short of expectations fundamental to insect resistance management plans. Patterns of aerial dispersal from Bt cornfields indicate that many females leave their natal fields shortly after mating and move long distances.

Joe!” Suspected Bt resistance in the rotation-resistant western corn rootworm,2014,Joseph L Spencer and Michael Gray and Sarah A Hughson and Ronald Estes and Nicholas Tinsley and Alexandra McMillan,,,,,,Bt resistance in the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte. WCR) is a phenomenon that was thought to be associated with the year-after-year cultivation of corn rootworm (CRW)-Bt corn hybrids (continuous corn) expressing the same Cry toxin. In late 2013. we investigated reports of greater than expected WCR injury to Cry3Bb1-expressing first-year. rotated corn across northeastern and east-central Illinois. These reports raised the possibility that WCR resistance to Bt may have evolved in an area where there is very little continuous corn. The affected area in Illinois coincides with the epicenter of WCR behavioral resistance to crop rotation. CRW-Bt corn hybrids are routinely planted in rotated cornfields in this area to counter the persistent threat of WCR rotation-resistance. The presence of suspected Bt resistance amongst rotation-resistant WCR populations links two very significant pest management challenges. Bt resistance in rotation-resistant WCR populations would negate the utility of crop rotation as a best management practice for growers experiencing greater than expected injury in Bt cornfields. Single plant Bt-resistance bioassays are underway using larvae obtained from some of the 2013 problem fields. During 2014-2016. we will work on-farm with Livingston and Kankakee Co. producers to evaluate several management approaches to suspected Bt-resistance in rotated Bt cornfields. Our evaluations and analyses of resistance bioassays will improve our understanding of WCR management tactics and support the development and deployment of more effectively-targeted management strategies.

We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment. including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover. we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells. suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed. all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity. with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally. we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens. including one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue.

The analyzed plants were harvested from the spontaneous flora of the Macin mountains (Luncavita forest) at a height 150-200m and from the Botanical Garden of Galati.(42 m height. landmark to The Black Sea). There were analysed the flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds from some natural herbs of families: Alliaceae (Allium ursinum). Brassicaceae (Alliaria petiolata) and Urticaceae (Urtica dioica) as crude hydroalcoolic extracts. The content of phenolic compounds was determined colorimetrically with the Folin–Ciocalteu (FC) reagent and was expressed in gallic acid equivalents (GAE). The flavonoid contents was determined using a method based on the formation of complex flavonoid-aluminium and was expressed in quercetin equivalents (QE). Also there was analyzed the β-carotene and chlorophyll contents by spectrophotometric method. Finally we tested the thermal resistance of sunflower oil after the incorporation of three species of natural herbs (the aerial part of plants). By this treatment. we seek to preserve almost unchanged the oil quality during thermal treatment. by increasing the level of antioxidants from oil. For this study. four different frying temperatures ie 110. 150. 180 and 200ºC were applied for 30 minutes to sunflower oil before and after addition of plants.

1077331,Quantification of carotenoids and chlorophyll leaf pigments from autochthones dietary,2017,Mariana LUPOAE and Bianca FURDUI and Rodica DINICĂ and Dragomir COPREAN,9,Food and Environment Safety Journal,4,,,Chlorophylls are the preponderant photosynthetic pigments of the verdant tissues of vascular plants. liverworts. and various algae. Carotenoids are essential for the survival of photosynthetic organisms. They function as light-harvesting molecules and provide photoprotection. Information gathered from the screening of secondary plant metabolites is vital for the accurate determination of the dietary intake of these micro-nutrients. and in the development of comprehensive food tables. Determination of basal levels is also necessary for the rational engineering of health-promoting phytochemicals in food crops. In addition this approach can also be applied to the routine screening of products to determine metabolic differences between varieties and cultivars. as well as between genetically modified and the corresponding non-genetically modified tissue. Beta-carotene accounts for more than 90% of total carotenoids in vegetables. In human beings. beta-carotene not only serves as valuable source of vitamin A. but also serves as a potent antioxidant. scavenging free radicals and quenching singlet oxygen. By this latter property. beta-carotene is understood to reduce the risk of development of certain types of cancer This study therefore is aimed at determining the beta-carotene and chlorophyll contents of same selected autochthones plants (Allium ursinum. Alliaria petiolata. Urtica dioica) from Macin Mountains harvested on spontaneous flora. Photosynthetic pigments of investigated plants were extracted from leaves using appropriate solvents.

In this study. different concentrations of aqueous leaf extract of Eucalyptus globulus (5%. 10%. 5%. 25%) were evaluated for allelopathic impacts on growth and cytogenetic behaviour of barley (Hordeum vulgare) plant. Results revealed a pronounced inhibitory effect of the aqueous extract on seed germination and seedling growth of barley plant. Cytogenetic analysis showed retardation of mitotic activity as well as occurrence of high percentage of chromosomal aberrations in Hordeum plants. Both recorded growth and cytogenetic effects were dose-dependent. At concentration 25%. the lower value of mitotic index (MI= 5.09%) and the higher percentage of chromosome abnormalities (CA= 35.25%. compared to control (9.1% and 5.25%). respectively. The observed abnormalities were disturbance. stickiness. laggards. vagrants. bridges and micronuclei. The results confirmed the presence of water-soluble allelochemicals in Eucalyptus extract which caused potential phytotoxic. cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in barley.

Phenotypic. metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the morphs differ solely in cyanidin pigments. which are linked to differential expression of an anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) gene.

An important mechanism in mediating plant-insect interactions is the regulation of gene expression via DNA methylation. However. the effect of herbivore-induced DNA methylation changes on pollinator-relevant plant signalling has not been systematically investigated. Here. we assessed the impact of foliar herbivory on DNA methylation and floral traits in the model crop plant Brassica rapa. Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MSAP) analysis showed that leaf damage by the caterpillar Pieris brassicae was associated with genome-wide methylation changes in both leaves and flowers of B. rapa as well as a downturn in flower number. morphology and scent. A comparison to plants with jasmonic acid-induced defence showed similar demethylation patterns in leaves. but both the floral methylome and phenotype differed significantly from P. brassicae infested plants. Standardised genome-wide demethylation with 5-azacytidine in five different B. rapa full-sib groups further resulted in a genotype-specific downturn of floral morphology and scent. which significantly reduced the attractiveness of the plants to the pollinator bee Bombus terrestris.

They have evolved a great variety of adaptations to achieve pollination by a diverse group of pollinators. Many orchids reward their pollinators. typically with nectar. but the family is also well-known for employing deceptive pollination strategies in which there is no reward for the pollinator. in the most extreme case by mimicking sexual signals of pollinators. In the European flora. two examples of these different pollination strategies are the sexually deceptive genus Ophrys and the rewarding genus Gymnadenia. which differ in their level of pollinator specialization; Ophrys is typically pollinated by pseudo-copulation of males of a single insect species. whilst Gymnadenia attracts a broad range of floral visitors.

Für die alten Naturalisten war es schlicht undenkbar. dass in Zeitspannen jenseits unserer Vorstellung kleine. graduelle Veränderungen Lebensformen hervorbringen können. welche sich so grundlegend unterscheiden wie zum Beispiel eine Maus und ein Baum. Inzwischen ist es jedoch allgemein anerkannt. dass solche mikro-evolutionären Veränderungen innerhalb organismischer Populationen die Grundlage für die grossen makro-evolutionären Wandlungen über dem Artniveau sind. Die Gruppe der Blütenpflanzen (Angiospermen) zeichnet sich durch besonders viele und diverse mikro-evolutionäre Veränderungen aus. Ungleich anderen Pflanzengruppen sind Angiospermen zum Austausch ihrer Keimzellen auf Interaktionen mit Bestäubern angewiesen welche hauptsächlich zu den Insekten gehören. Nicht alle biotischen Interaktionen sind jedoch von Vorteil für die Pflanze. und Angiospermen müssen gleichzeitig die Anlockung mutualistischer Bestäuberinsekten und die Abschreckung antagonistischer Insekten wie zum Beispiel Herbivoren maximieren. Die Kommunikation mit Insekten beeinflusst somit sowohl die Reproduktion als auch das Überleben von Pflanzen. was die Entstehung mikro-evolutionärer Veränderungen in Pflanzenmerkmalen fördert.Das ungebrochene Interesse an Insekten-induzierter Mikroevolution von Pflanzen hat unsere Kenntnisse über die ihr zugrunde liegenden Mechanismen beachtlich vorangebracht.

We have applied an eco-evo-devo approach to assess the selective forces maintaining a polymorphism with three floral morphs in the Alpine orchid Gymnadenia rhellicani. Field observations revealed that bee and fly pollinators exert opposite directional selection on flower colour. together maximising seed set in the intermediate morph. A combination of phenotypic. metabolomic. and transcriptomic analyses further showed that the morphs differ solely in the concentration of cyanidin pigments. which is linked to differential expression of an anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) gene. Finally. transcriptome-wide association mapping identified a SNP heterozygous in the intermediate morph. inserting a premature stop codon in an ANS regulating R2R3-MYB transcription factor. Altogether. these findings support the classic idea that polymorphisms can evolve by overdominant selection of a single locus.,True,LIVl9ZQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153387/1/153387.pdf#page=97,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153387/1/153387.pdf#page=97,0,0,0
1077387,Chapter I Herbivore-induced DNA demethylation changes floral signalling and attractiveness to pollinators in Brassica rapa,2018,Roman T Kellenberger and Philipp M Schlüter and Florian P Schiestl,11,Insect-Mediated Microevolution of Flowering Plants,,45,Universität Zürich,Plants have to fine-tune their signals to optimise the trade-off between herbivore deterrence and pollinator attraction. An important mechanism in mediating plant-insect interactions is the regulation of gene expression via DNA methylation. However. the effect of herbivore-induced DNA methylation changes on pollinator-relevant plant signalling has not been systematically investigated. Here. we assessed the impact of foliar herbivory on DNA methylation and floral traits in the model crop plant Brassica rapa. Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MSAP) analysis showed that leaf damage by the caterpillar Pieris brassicae was associated with genome-wide methylation changes in both leaves and flowers of B. rapa as well as a downturn in flower number. morphology and scent. A comparison to plants with jasmonic acidinduced defence showed similar demethylation patterns in leaves. but both the floral methylome and phenotype differed significantly from P. brassicae infested plants. Standardised genome-wide demethylation with 5-azacytidine in five different B. rapa full-sib groups further resulted in a genotype-specific downturn of floral morphology and scent. which significantly reduced the attractiveness of the plants to the pollinator bee Bombus terrestris. These results suggest that DNA methylation plays an important role in adjusting plant signalling in response to changing insect communities.,True,LIVl9ZQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153387/1/153387.pdf#page=45,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153387/1/153387.pdf#page=45,0,0,0

Recently. it has been shown that such changes can be transmitted to subsequent generations. However. the occurrence and extent of transmission across different types of traits is still unexplored. Here. we assessed the emergence and transmission of herbivory-induced changes in Brassica rapa. and their impact on interactions with insects. We analysed changes in morphology and reproductive traits as well as in flower-and leaf volatile emission during two generations with leaf herbivory by Mamestra brassicae and Pieris brassicae. and two subsequent generations without herbivory. Herbivory induced changes in all trait types. increasing attractiveness of the plants to the parasitoid wasp Cotesia glomerata and decreasing visitation by the pollinator Bombus terrestris. a potential tradeoff. While changes in floral-and leaf volatiles disappeared in the first generation after herbivory. some changes in morphology and reproductive traits were still measurable two generations after herbivory. However. neither parasitoids nor pollinators further discriminated between groups with different past treatments. Our results suggest that transmission of herbivore-induced changes occurs preferentially in resource-limited traits connected to plant growth and reproduction. The lack of alterations in plant-insect interactions was likely due to the transient nature of volatile changes.,True,LIVl9ZQAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153387/1/153387.pdf#page=73,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/153387/1/153387.pdf#page=73,0,0,0

Calpain activators induce apoptosis in several types of nucleated cells. However. it is not clear whether calpain activators induce platelet apoptosis. Here we show that the calpain activator dibucaine induced several platelet apoptotic events including depolarization of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. up-regulation of Bax and Bak. down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L. caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine exposure. Platelet apoptosis elicited by dibucaine was not affected by the broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. Furthermore. dibucaine did not induce platelet activation as detected by P-selectin expression and PAC-1 binding. However. platelet aggregation induced by ristocetin or α-thrombin. platelet adhesion and spreading on von Willebrand factor were significantly inhibited in platelets treated with dibucaine. Taken together. these data indicate that dibucaine induces platelet apoptosis and platelet dysfunction.

Forward genetic approaches. such as screens conducted in C. elegans. have successfully identified genes required to process natural sensory stimuli. However. functional redundancy within the underlying neural circuits. which are often organized with multiple parallel neural pathways. limits our ability to identify ‘neural pathway-specific genes’. i.e. genes that are essential for the function of some. but not all of these redundant neural pathways. To overcome this limitation. we developed a ‘forward optogenetics’ screening strategy in which natural stimuli are initially replaced by the selective optogenetic activation of a specific neural pathway. We used this strategy to address the function of the polymodal FLP nociceptors mediating avoidance of noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. According to our expectations. we identified both mutations in ‘general’ avoidance genes that broadly impact avoidance responses to a variety of natural noxious stimuli (unc-4. unc-83. and eat-4) and mutations that produce a narrower impact. more restricted to the FLP pathway (syd-2. unc-14 and unc-68). Through a detailed follow-up analysis. we further showed that the Ryanodine receptor UNC-68 acts cell-autonomously in FLP to adjust heat-evoked calcium signals and aversive behaviors. As a whole. our work (i) reveals the importance of properly regulated ER calcium release for FLP function.

Rac1 plays essential roles ranging from chemotaxis and neuronal migration to neuritogenesis. synapsis formation and plasticity. Rac1 activity is positively and negatively controlled by several molecules. however the role of each specific regulators is poorly known. We have generated mice null for ArhGAP15. a Rac1-specific GTPase-activating protein expressed in embryonic migrating interneurons and in a large fraction of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the adult cortex and hippocampus. Loss of ArhGAP15 results in hyper-activation of Rac1 in the embryonic and adult forebrain. and increased retrograde actin dynamic at the growth cone. associated with defects in neuronal migration. reduced neuritogenesis and reduced spine formation. In spite of a nearly normal cyto-architecture and cortical layering. EEG spectral analysis show reduced high-frequency activity. increased lower frequencies activity. and overall reduced variability. Furthermore. multi-electrode array recordings of spontaneous activity of cultured primary neurons from ArhGAP15 KO cortex and hippocampus show delayed onset. reduced amplitude. reduced variability and inability to synchronize. Finally we observe motor hyperactivity.

Their presence in nature has prompted their historical use in many different ways. The revision of their traditional utilization has allowed their further modification aiming for an industrial application. Sometimes these modifications have implied the addition of harmful substances such as formaldehyde. classified as a carcinogen of category B1. In other cases. these natural tannins have been replaced by synthetic compounds that threaten human and animal health and damage the environment. Therefore. currently. both academy and industry are searching for the substitution of these unsafe complexes by the increasing inclusion of tannins. natural molecules that can be obtained from several and diverse renewable resources. modified using harmless additives. To achieve promising results. cost-efficient and eco-friendly extraction methods have been designed.

Their high content in proteins. carbohydrates and vitamins. but also in secondary metabolites such as phenolic compounds. terpenoids or pigments. make them great candidates for industrial applications. The cosmetic industry is one of the biggest in the world and the search for new ingredients is constantly growing as the consumer trend now is going back to those traditional cosmetics with a more natural composition. Moreover. the concept of a circular economy is also gaining importance due to the unsustainable situation of the natural resources. Although macroalgae are already used in cosmetics. especially as thickening and gelling agents. they possess an unexplored potential. not only as excipients and additives but also as a source of new active ingredients. In this context. macroalgae are considered in many cases as resources still underexploited and they could even be obtained from the waste of other industrial sectors and be used for recovering active molecules. Therefore. the aim of this review is to compile information about the different macroalgae metabolites and their possible applications in the cosmetic industry. which could employ circular economy models.

The complex variety of volatile compounds. coming from grapes. interact with other non-volatile substances of the wine as precursors of wine’s aroma. known as primary aromas. which give the aroma of the young wine. The volatile compounds present in the skin and in the grape juice change according to the grape variety. Most of wine volatile compounds responsible for aroma are linked to sugars and they initially form odorless glycosides. Through the process of hydrolysis. they are reverted into an aromatic form. Chemical reactions among these compounds occur during the fermentation and in the first months of a wine’s existence. triggering fast and multiple modifications in wine’s aroma at this point. As wine ages and matures. changes and development in aroma will continue to take place but at a slower and more gradual pace. The study of the compounds responsible for aroma and flavor. as well as their correlation with the wine quality. is ongoing. Improving the knowledge of wine aromatic compounds could increase the risk of its potential adulteration; however. consumers prefer wine for its natural origin. so this scenario is unlikely in the future.,True,Hs--sS4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,3,https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/management-of-wine-aroma-compounds-principal-basis-and-future-perspectives,5701778747495147191,/scholar?cites=5701778747495147191,,https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/management-of-wine-aroma-compounds-principal-basis-and-future-perspectives,0,0,0

Additionally. a circular economy has been proposed as the most efficient production system since it allows for reducing and reutilizing different wastes. Current agriculture is responsible for producing high quantities of organic agricultural waste (eg. discarded fruits and vegetables. peels. leaves. seeds or forestall residues). that usually ends up underutilized and accumulated. causing environmental problems. Interestingly. these agri-food by-products are potential sources of valuable bioactive molecules such as tannins. Tannins are phenolic compounds. secondary metabolites of plants widespread in terrestrial and aquatic natural environments. As they can be found in plenty of plants and herbs. they have been traditionally used for medicinal and other purposes. such as the leather industry. This fact is explained by the fact that they exert plenty of different biological activities and. thus. they entail a great potential to be used in the food. nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry. Consequently. this review article is directed towards the description of the biological activities exerted by tannins as they could be further extracted from by-products of the agri-food industry to produce high-added-value products.

We described the species composition affected by road mortality. estimated the road-kill rates for each studied road segment. and also analyzed the spatial and temporal distributions of reptile road-kills. identifying the location of road-kill hotspots. and proposing mitigation measures. During an 8-month period. we recorded a total of 66 road-killed reptiles belonging to 18 species. There was difference in the number of roadkills among seasons. being the rainy season where there was a biggest number of road-kill events. The road with the highest number of road-kill events was Departmental Route 1 (DR01) this also presents the highest road-kill rates relative to the other road segments assessed. Spatial distribution for road-kill reptiles was non-random for the route DR01. indicating that mortalities were aggregated in some locations. which correspond to potential road-kill hotspots. The road-kill hotspots identified in this study offer a unique opportunity for design efficient mitigation measures that will work properly. Based on our results. as well as in the social and economic reality of the study region. we consider that mitigation measures should be focused on changing driver behavior. involving educational plans to increase public awareness and promote in the local people behaviors in benefit to wildlife …,True,iNHbIBQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,7,https://www.biotaxa.org/hn/article/view/29825,3999915512152969908,/scholar?cites=3999915512152969908,,https://www.biotaxa.org/hn/article/download/29825/31203,0,0,0

These techniques consist mainly of soft tissue clearance by enzymatic or caustic digestion and staining of bone. cartilage. or nerves. However. although there is an increasing need to describe other soft-anatomy structures. such as ligaments and tendons. the methods available to visualize these tissues are a challenge that requires very fine dissections and three-dimensional reconstructions using tissue sections or microtomography. In this paper we present a simple and economical method for staining fibrous connective tissues. particularly ligaments and tendons. The method begins with an enzymatic proteolysis that prevents unselective soft tissue degradation.

Amphibians may be susceptible to habitat alterations because of their sensitivity to microclimate changes. limited dispersal capacities. and high susceptibility to desiccation (Nowakowski et al. 2013; Robinson et al. 2013; Mendenhall et al. 2014). Previous studies at tropical latitudes have shown that human habitat disturbance generates changes in the structure and composition of amphibian ensembles. promotes the spread of generalists and alien species. and probably leads to local extinctions of species (Urbina-Cardona et al. 2006; Isaacs and Urbina-Cardona 2011; Cortés-Gómez et al. 2013). Given the unprecedented rate of habitat loss in many tropical regions. scientists have focused on assessing the potential of human-altered landscapes. such as agroecosystems. as an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation (Schroth et al. 2004; Somarriba et al. 2004). Shaded coffee plantations resemble forest-like habitats in terms of vegetation structure and density. including several levels of vertical stratification of arboreal elements and a complex canopy that modulate the microclimates of the coffee understory. which are likely to be critical to maintain levels of biodiversity comparable with those found in adjacent native forests (Perfecto et al. 1996; Moguel and Toledo 1999; Somarriba et al. 2004; Philpott et al. 2008; Urrutia-Escobar and Armbrecht 2013).

Identification of salt tolerant cultivars and improving tolerance of plants is the most effective method for increasing yield. To evaluate the response of growth and pigment contents in canola genotypes to salinity. a factorial complete randomized design with four replications was conducted. Sodium chloride salinity at three levels 0. 175 and 350 mM on two genotypes. Brassica napus L. cv.Sarigol and Brassica napus L. cv.Hyola308 was applied in stages 3-4 leaves. Dry weight of shoots and roots. chlorophyll a and b. carotenes and xanthophylls. anthocyanins. flavonoids and finally UV absorbing compounds contents were studied in the leaves. The results showed root dry weights reduced in both genotypes during high salinity conditions. The exposure of Sarigol plants to 175 mM NaCl induced a significant increase in shoot dry weight. but salinity had no significant effect on Hyola308 plants. Only in Sarigol cultivar Chlorophyll a contents increased during low salinity but Chlorophyll b contents decreased with high salinity. Increasing carotenoids in Hyola308 could be a reason of resistance to salinity and stability in photosynthetic structures. Under high salinity. there was not a significant trend in decreasing non-photosynthetic pigments in both genotypes. So it could be concluded that in canola plants. one of the most important factors for salinity tolerance could be unimpairing the main photosynthetic pigments.,True,vUemmUwAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,7,https://ijpb.ui.ac.ir/article_18818.html?lang=en,7074120325634469960,/scholar?cites=7074120325634469960,,https://ijpb.ui.ac.ir/article_18818.html?lang=en,0,0,0

Under salinity conditions. plants are subjected to a secondary oxidative stress. The present work was designed to examine the exogenous application of nitric oxide (NO). in the form of its donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). in mitigating the deleterious effects of salinity on Zygophyllum fabago L. plants. SNP (200 µM) was applied to plants growing medium under saline (200 and 400 mM NaCl) and non-saline conditions. Growth. oxidative stress markers [cell membrane stability index (MSI) and H2O2 concentration]. antioxidant enzymes activities [peroxidase (POX. EC 1.11. 1.7) and catalase (CAT.

Salinity lowered the shoot and root dry weights. while it enhanced peroxidase and catalase activities. High salinity increased H2O2; however. it decreased the carotenoids content of leaves. Exogenous NO enhanced the growth. MSI. flavonoids and carotenoids contents of salinized plants. In salinity plus SNP treated plants.

1077487,The psy transcript level and cell composition of Dunaliella salina under salinity,2015,Leila Zarandi Miandoab and Mohammad Bager Bagherieh-Najjar and MA Hejazi and N Chaparzadeh,6,Int J Biosci,,34-43,,Dunaliella salina is a unicellular photosynthetic microalga that demonstrates a considerable degree of environmental adaptation to difficult conditions. Under abiotic stress conditions. such as salinity. the cells accumulate specific compounds. including carotenoids and/or glycerol. as a result of up regulation in certain genes as well as biosynthetic pathways. The final output of these changes manifests in resistance against hyper saline conditions. In the present study. we aimed to identify important compounds produced and accumulated in D. salina cell in resistance to salinity stress. D. salina CCAP 19/18 cells cultured under 2 or 4 M NaCl. while light intensity. temperature and nutrient supply were in optimal amounts for algal growth. Data show that. there were lower number of cells and protein content while lipid. glycerol and starch contents significantly increased in cells exposed to 4 M salinity. Interestingly. there were negative correlation between glycerol concentration and the amount of starch in the cells suggesting that the starch breakdown provides precursors of glycerol biosynthesis. Main nutrient uptake by cells in 2 M culture medium was higher than that in 4 M NaCl. leaded to higher amount of proteins in low salinity cultured cells. Unlike glycerol. accumulation of carotenoids was not observed under high salinity. Data indicated that reduced levels of psy transcript repressed carotenoid (β-carotene) production under 4 M NaCl after 4 day. This study strongly suggests that salinity level of medium can affect nutrient uptake and metabolites accumulation of D. salina cells.

1077494,Hama utama pada pembibitan lada dan pengendaliannya,2015,Rismayani and Rohimatun and I Wayan Laba,,Prosiding Seminar Perbenihan Tanaman Rempah Dan Obat,,223-232,,Salah satu kendala petani lada di Indonesia pada tahap pembibitan adalah serangan hama yang dapat menghambat proses budidaya tanaman. Bibit merupakan salah satu faktor utama keberhasilan usahatani lada. Lophobaris piperis. Thrips sp.. dan Planococcus minor merupakan hama yang banyak ditemukan pada tahap pembibitan lada. L. piperis bermetamorfosis sempurna mulai dari telur-larva-pupa sampai imago. Larva L. piperis hidup di bagian dalam ruas-ruas batang lada yang menyebabkan penyerapan unsur hara dan distribusi hasil fotosintesis terganggu. Hama ini dapat menyebabkan kerusakan hingga 43. 8%. bahkan kematian. apabila seluruh batang tanaman terserang. Thrips sp. bereproduksi secara partenogenesis dan hanya memerlukan waktu sembilan hari untuk menyelesaikan satu siklus hidup. Satu ekor betina Thrips sp. rata-rata menghasilkan 80 butir telur selama hidupnya. Serangga tersebut merusak struktur daun. baik yang masih muda maupun tua. P. minor merupakan serangga vektor penyakit kerdil. Serangga ini seringkali ditemui pada persemaian bibit lada. P. minor mampu bertelur hingga 270 butir dalam satu siklus hidupnya. Pengendalian ketiga hama tersebut dapat dilakukan dengan menerapkan konsep Pengelolaan Hama Terpadu (PHT). antara lain mengintegrasikan penggunaan varietas toleran. kultur teknis yang baik dan benar. pengendalian secara hayati dan fisik-mekanik serta penggunaan pestisida. Penggunaan pestisida. terutama sintetik. merupakan alternatif terakhir ketika pengendalian lain sudah tidak dapat dilaksanakan.

Replication dynamics. in particular. is highly correlated with GC content. We combine genome-wide time of replication (ToR) data. topological domains maps and detailed functional epigenetic annotations to study the correlations between replication timing and GC content at multiple scales. We find that the decrease in genomic GC content at large scale late replicating regions can be explained by mutation bias favoring A/T nucleotide. without selection or biased gene conversion. Quantification of the free dNTP pool during the cell cycle is consistent with a mechanism involving replication-coupled mutation spectrum that favors AT nucleotides at late S-phase.

Large. Mb-sized regions are replicated at defined times along S-phase. Replication Timing (RT) is thought to play a role in shaping the mammalian genome by affecting mutation rates. Previous analyses relied on somatic RT profiles. However. only germline mutations are passed on to offspring and affect genomic composition. Therefore. germ cell RT information is necessary to evaluate the influences of RT on the mammalian genome. We adapted the RT mapping technique for limited amounts of cells. and measured RT from two stages in the mouse germline - primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs).

During kidney development. cells from the cap mesenchyme – a transient kidney-specific progenitor state – undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and subsequently differentiate into the various epithelial cell types that create the tubular structures of the nephron. Faults in this transition can lead to a pediatric malignancy of the kidney called Wilms’ tumor that mimics normal kidney development. While kidney development has been characterized at the gene expression level. a comprehensive characterization of alternative splicing is lacking. We therefore performed RNA sequencing on cell populations representing early. intermediate. and late developmental stages of the human fetal kidney. as well as three blastemal-predominant Wilms’ tumor patient-derived xenografts. We identified a set of transcripts that are alternatively spliced between the different developmental stages. Moreover. we found that cells from the earliest developmental stage have a mesenchymal splice-isoform profile that is similar to that of blastemal-predominant Wilms’ tumors. RNA binding motif enrichment analysis suggests that the mRNA binding proteins ESRP1. ESRP2. RBFOX2. and QKI regulate mRNA splice isoform switching during human kidney development. These findings illuminate new molecular mechanisms involved in kidney development and pediatric kidney tumors.During fetal kidney development. kidney progenitor cells undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and subsequently differentiate into the various epithelial cell types that create the tubular structures of the …,True,ndtI7YMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/816371v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/10/24/816371.full.pdf,0,0,0

1077533,Moth-inspired methods for particle capture on a cylinder,2020,Thomas L Spencer and Nina Mohebbi and Guangyuan Jin and Matthew L Forister and Alexander Alexeev and David L Hu,884,Journal of Fluid Mechanics,,,Cambridge University Press,We study particle capture on an angled cylinder at a range of Péclet numbers. This system was inspired by the plumose antennae of certain species of male moths that intercept female pheromones at low Péclet numbers of 0.9–23. We use confocal microscopy to measure the branching patterns of 49 moths. spanning 12 families and two orders of magnitude in mass. Among the three levels of hierarchy in antennae. we find the middle level has a prevalent branching angle. 52◦±12◦ across our study set. Such intermediate branching angles are a surprising way to intercept molecules because they do not maximize the exposed surface area. To understand the benefits of angling cylinders into the flow. we study particle collection at high Péclet number using 10 µm drops that are several orders of magnitude larger than moth pheromones. Wind tunnel tests show that cylinders angled at 30◦–60◦ are optimal for collection of particles. collecting 30% more than when perpendicular to the flow. Simulations and smoke visualization show that angled cylinders bend incoming streamlines. creating a lingering effect near the cylinder that can enhance deposition by diffusion. We surmise that the optimal angle arises from a trade-off between the lingering effect. which decreases with increasing angle of the cylinder. and the cylinder’s increasing projected area as it is turned more perpendicular to the flow. Using a mathematical model. we show that only cylinders at low Péclet number show improved collection at intermediate angles. Thus. we cannot rationalize the high collection rates in our wind tunnel experiments at high Péclet number.

A number of mechanical and chemical solutions have been proposed to scrape off or kill the biofilms. but they can be sensor-specific. costly. or have adverse effects on the environment [2].

We tested predictions of FoF in two globally invasive fire ants. Solenopsis geminata (Fabricius. 1804) and S. invicta (Buren. 1972). Colonies of these species may produce two different monogyne queen types—claustral queens with heavy abdomens that found colonies independently. and parasitic queens with small abdomens that enter conspecific nests. Claustral and parasitic queens were similarly sized. but the abdomens of claustral queens weighed twice as much as those of their parasitic counterparts. Their heavier abdomens adversely impacted morphological predictors of flight ability. resulting in 32–38% lower flight muscle ratios. 55–63% higher wing loading. and 32–33% higher abdomen drag. In lab experiments maximum flight durations in claustral S. invicta queens decreased by about 18 minutes for every milligram of abdomen mass. Combining our results into a simple fitness tradeoff model. we calculated that an average parasitic S. invicta queen could produce only 1/3 as many worker offspring as a claustral queen. but could fly 4 times as long and have a 17- to 36-fold larger potential colonization area.

In this research we used a novel way to estimate the impact of floods upon the substrate. by utilising a remote variable named “flash-flood potential” (FFP). which accounts for the site slope and the average slope of the upstream catchment. The results showed that certain groups are sensitive to the influence of the FFP whereas other are not. We propose this remote variable as a surrogate for assessing stress imposed by floods and sediment scouring for lotic macroinvertebrates.,True,eSlU0DkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/trser/21/1/article-p45.xml,,,,https://content.sciendo.com/downloadpdf/journals/trser/21/1/article-p45.pdf,0,0,0

Of 39 owls captured between February and August 1999. 16 (41.0%) were infected with Leucocytozoon ziemanni. One individual was infected with Trypanosoma sp. and another with a microfilaria. Age was the only variable influencing the prevalence of L. ziemanni in a multivariate logistic regression model: adults were more often infected than juveniles (82.4%. n= 17 vs. 9.1%. n= 22). This difference was probably due to the scarcity of appropriate vectors in the area at time of fledging. There was also a trend that infected adults owls had shorter bills than uninfected ones. This may indicate that infection may be associated with individual song characteristics of Little Owls. since a relationship between bill length and song features was found previously in the same area.,True,LKeGJGEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,15,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erkki_Korpimaeki/publication/228683514_Factors_affecting_the_prevalence_of_blood_parasites_of_Little_Owls_Athene_noctua_in_southern_Portugal/links/0912f50a364a904985000000/Factors-affecting-the-prevalence-of-blood-parasites-of-Little-Owls-Athene-noctua-in-southern-Portugal.pdf,5610706266152901684,/scholar?cites=5610706266152901684,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erkki_Korpimaeki/publication/228683514_Factors_affecting_the_prevalence_of_blood_parasites_of_Little_Owls_Athene_noctua_in_southern_Portugal/links/0912f50a364a904985000000/Factors-affecting-the-prevalence-of-blood-parasites-of-Little-Owls-Athene-noctua-in-southern-Portugal.pdf,0,0,0

The arrival of this commensal species in Britain is thought to be related to human transport and trade with continental Europe. In order to study this arrival. we collected a total of 16 ancient mouse mandibulae from four early British archaeological sites. ranging from the Late Bronze Age to the Roman period. From these. we obtained ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) house mouse sequences from eight house mice from two of the sites dating from the Late Bronze to Middle Iron Age. We also obtained five ancient mtDNA wood mouse (Apodemus spp.) sequences from all four sites. The ancient house mouse sequences found in this study were from haplogroups E (N = 6) and D (N = 2). Modern British house mouse mtDNA sequences are primarily characterised by haplogroups E and F and. much less commonly. haplogroup D. The presence of haplogroups D and E in our samples and the dating of the archaeological sites provide evidence of an early house mouse colonisation that may relate to Late Bronze Age/Iron Age trade and/or human expansion. Our results confirm the hypothesis. based on zooarchaeological evidence and modern mtDNA predictions. that house mice. with haplogroups D and E. were established in Britain by the Iron Age and. in the case of haplogroup E. possibly as early as the Late Bronze Age.,True,S5BQ7EwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-021-01746-4,,,,https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-021-01746-4,0,0,0

Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) shifts cytosolic glucose metabolism to aerobic oxidation by inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and increasing pyruvate uptake. Therefore. DCA has potential in reversing the glycolytic metabolism defect in cancerous cells. DCA is also known to induce apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines. the mechanism of which is not well understood. In this study. an attempt has been made to investigate the effects of DCA on aggressive human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells as compared with less aggressive mouse osteoblastic (MC3T3) cells. Cell cytotoxicity was determined by MTT. crystal violet and Trypan blue exclusion assays. Western blot was used to detect any changes in the expression of apoptotic markers. Flow cytometry was used to measure apoptotic and necrotic effects of DCA. Mitochondrial integrity was determined by change in mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). whereas oxidative damage was determined by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). DCA caused a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity both in MCF-7 and MC3T3 cell lines. MCF-7 cells were most affected. Flow cytometry results showed a significantly higher apoptosis in MCF-7 even at lower concentrations of DCA. However. higher concentrations of DCA were necrotic.

Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is known to target the glycolytic pathway in cancer cells and facilitates reversal of metabolic transformation from aerobic cytosolic accumulation of pyruvic acid. “the Warburg effect”. to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Recently. combination therapy particularly involving photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received considerable attention in oncology. We hypothesized that if DCA and PDT are combined. they might potentiate mitochondrial dysfunction and induce apoptosis by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent pathway. We used MCF-7 cells as our in vitro model and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) dependent PDT therapy to test our hypothesis. We found that combinatorial treatment of MCF-7 cells with PDT and DCA not only increased cell growth inhibition. but also affected mitochondrial membrane integrity perhaps via production of ROS. and enhanced apoptosis. Further. our results on ATP release during the combined treatment demonstrate that immunogenic cell death (ICD) is likely to be a potential mechanism by which PDT and DCA induce cancer cell death. Taken together. our study suggests a novel way of sensitizing MCF-7 cells for accelerated induction of apoptosis and ICD in these cells.

They regulate a variety of cellular processes including programmed cell death or apoptosis. Apoptosis maintains tissue homeostasis in higher organisms. Among inositol polyphosphates. inositolhexakisphosphate was found to be the most potent inducer of apoptosis in mammalian cells. however. the mechanism of apoptosis particularly mediated by InsPs is not well understood in simple eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium discoideum. despite InsPs having been well studied in this model organism.

1077598,The relationship between individual phenotype and the division of labour in naked mole-rats: it’s complicated,2020,James D Gilbert and Stephen J Rossiter and Chris G Faulkes,8,PeerJ,,e9891,PeerJ Inc.,The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is among the most social mammals on the planet. living in eusocial groups of up to 300 individuals that contain a single reproductive female and up to three reproductive males. A critical aspect of their complex social system is the division of labour that allows non-breeders to form an effective workforce. Age- or weight-based polyethisms are widely cited as explanations for how labour is divided. but evidence in support of these hypotheses has been equivocal.To assess the extent to which individual working behaviour is determined by sex. age. weight and social rank. we studied the behaviours of 103 animals from eight captive colonies. We performed focal sampling and ran mixed-effects models to assess which factors explained variation in working behaviour during six ten-minute observation periods per individual.Contrary to widely-held beliefs. we found that working behaviour did not decrease linearly with weight. although polynomial regressions indicated younger and medium-sized individuals worked most frequently. while high-ranking individuals worked for the shortest periods of time. Working behaviour and its relationship with individual characteristics also varied between colonies.While age- or size-based polyethisms may have some influence on working behaviour. we argue that other characteristics of the individual and colony are also important.

Each power grid has its own electrical network frequency pattern which is considered as a signature or a finger print of this power grid. Any audio/video recorded in a power grid. whether directly connected to the power mains or not. is affected by the ENF signature of this grid. Post processing could take place to extract the ENF pattern from recordings which can be used in localization of different media signals recorded among grids. This can be done through computing the cross correlation between extracted ENF and the original ENFs of the grids. Finding the time of recording becomes possible. There are much more applications for ENF extraction and recognition. In this project we have worked on data set of 9 (A to I) different grids provided by the contest. ENFs of these power grids are extracted for power and audio recordings then characteristic features of these ENFs are extracted and accurately selected.

This can take place at a University clinic. as well as at non-University hospitals. Aims: The Swedish Hematology Association appointed a Work Unit (WU) of resident hematologists lead by two senior colleagues with a vast teaching experience. to develop a yearly progress test for evaluation of hematology residents in Sweden. The framework for the progress test was the EHA curriculum and EHA CV Passport. which divides the Hematology Specialty into eight large parts. with subunits to systematically cover the whole of Hematology. Methods: Individuals or groups of Swedish experts in each field. eg the National Diagnostic Groups. were asked to produce a number of multiple choice (MCQ) questions. The questions were read. revised and sorted by the appointed WU. after which 75 MCQ questions were selected for the first progress test. These questions covered the eight major fields of the EHA CV Passport: benign clinical hematology (n= 8). myeloid malignancies (n= 11). lymphoid and plasma cell disorders (n= 18). stem cell transplantation and special therapy (n= 9). laboratory diagnosis (n= 11). thrombosis and hemostasis (n= 8). transfusion medicine (n= 4 as this is a separate specialist education in Sweden. not sorting under Hematology). and general skills (n= 5).

The continued use of DMIs places considerable selection pressure on natural P. fijiensis populations. enabling the selection of novel genotypes with reduced sensitivity. The hitherto explanatory mechanism for this reduced sensitivity was the presence of non‐synonymous point mutations in the target gene Pfcyp51. encoding the sterol 14α‐demethylase enzyme.

The 14α-Demethylase Inhibitors (DMIs) are important disease control fungicides. but they lose sensitivity in a rather gradual fashion. suggesting an underlying polygenic genetic mechanism. In spite of this. evidence found thus far suggests that P. fijiensis cyp51 gene mutations are the main responsible factor for sensitivity loss in the field. To better understand the mechanisms involved in DMI resistance. in this study we constructed a genetic map using DArTseq markers on two F1 populations generated by crossing two different DMI resistant strains with a sensitive strain. Analysis of the inheritance of DMI resistance in the F1 populations revealed two major and discrete DMI-sensitivity groups. This is an indicative of a single major responsible gene. Using the DMI-sensitivity scorings of both F1 populations and the generation of genetic linkage maps. the sensitivity causal factor was located in a single genetic region. Full agreement was found for genetic markers in either population. underlining the robustness of the approach. The two maps indicated a similar genetic region where the Pfcyp51 gene is found. Sequence analyses of the Pfcyp51 gene of the F1 populations also revealed a matching bimodal distribution with the DMI resistant. Amino acid substitutions in P. fijiensis CYP51 enzyme of the resistant progeny were previously correlated with the loss of DMI sensitivity.

P. hD. Wageningen University: Wageningen",,23-58,,Bananas are among the most important crops worldwide (Ploetz 2000; Ploetz et al. 2015). The 2012–2013 banana market review from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). stated that the global production of bananas was around 106.7 millions of tons. Global export reached 16.5 million tons with a gross production value of US $29.7 billion (FAO 2014a. b). Nonetheless. global export of banana represents only 15.5% of the total banana production. The remaining 84.5% represents banana production for local consumption. This stresses the importance of the banana fruit as a staple food in many tropical and subtropical developing countries. It is believed that banana is a starchy staple food for approximately 500 million people (Collins 2014). Many banana varieties for local consumption are relative cheap and easy to produce. Sadly. many of these varieties are susceptible to black Sigatoka disease. an important leaf defoliation disease that is caused by the dothideomycete fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis (previously Mycosphaerella fijiensis)(Arango et al. 2016).The disease causes substantial direct and indirect losses due to defoliation and consequently reduced yields as well as due to premature ripening of the fruit. turning them into an unfit commodity for the export. respectively (Ploetz 2000). The main control measure involves frequent fungicide applications with a very high environmental and economic burden (Chong et al. 2016b; Chong et al. 2016c; Risède et al. 2010).

Bananas are the global top export fruit. with an average of 114 million tons/year. dominated by Cavendish clones that take a major share (90%). but which are also increasingly important for local markets (FAO. 2003; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2015). Cooking bananas and plantains are major staple foods in tropical and subtropical countries in central Africa. South East Asia and Latin America (Mohan and Swennen. 2004; Ortiz and Swennen. 2014). Many banana varieties are highly susceptible to black Sigatoka or black leaf streak disease (Fullerton and Olsen. 1995). Disease management in this perennial crop largely relies on frequent fungicide applications. The frequency varies over environments but is commonly over 50 times per year (Chong. 2016; Lapeyre De Bellaire et al.. 2010; FRAC. 2010) and commonly represents up to 40% of the total production costs (Chong. 2016; Martínez-Bolaños et al.. 2012).

Pods,2016,James Kennard Sanz Jacob and Eden S David,3,Advancements in Life Sciences,4,125-129,,Background: Crop diseases and human health are always at stake and the emerging problem on the use of synthetic anti-pathogens and medicine is one of the most difficult to combat. The first step towards determining such capabilities among plants is to determine their phytochemicals.Methods: Eight preliminary phytochemical tests was done on Samanea saman which includes. test for alkaloids saponins. flavonoids. tannins. glycosides. steroids. terpenoids and resins. Powdered pods were subjected to ethanol and aqueous extraction. Extracts were also tested for its antifungal and anti-microbial properties against Fusarium oxysporum. E. coli and S. aureus. respectively.Results: Out of the eight phytochemical tests done. seven (7) were found to be present both on the ethanol and aqueous extracts namely. alkaloids. saponins. tannins. glycosides. steroids. terpenoids and resins. However. flavonoids is absent. The statistical results exhibited that there is a significant difference on the inhibitory effects against in-vitro bioassay of Fusarium oxysporumwhich is known to cause crop wilts and the two bacterial pathogens E. coli and S. aureus.Conclusions: The presence of such phytochemicals in Samanea saman pods revealed that it can be a basis of new. natural and non-synthetic treatments. This finding suggests that its pods can be used as antibacterial and antifungal source.,True,VImuMhwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5,http://submission.als-journal.com/index.php/ALS/article/view/190,582024481814971530,/scholar?cites=582024481814971530,,http://submission.als-journal.com/index.php/ALS/article/download/190/130,0,0,0

In the Philippines. many researches have been upraised to review the current ethnobotanical state and pharmacological properties of plants thriving for many indigenous tribes. One specific plant used by the Kalanguya tribe of the Northeastern Philippines is Derris elliptica. locally known as Derris elliptica. used as a fish poison. and only minor information was known about this indigenous plant’s taxonomy. This research was undertaken to evaluate the fungal-inhibiting capability of Derris ellipticaagainst two fungal plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporumand Fusarium moniliforme. Hot water extracts of Derris elliptica exhibited fungal inhibition to F. oxysporum as indicated by a retarded mycelial growth response (26.35 mm) compared to its negative control (70.07 mm) after five (5) days of incubation. The same observation was also exuded against F. moniliforme which also exhibited slow mycelial growth (28.28 mm) compared to the negative control (70.86 mm).

The goal of the study was to determine if the sugar content of bottled 100% fruit juice with a “no sugar added” label is equivalent to that of extracted juices of fresh fruits. The reported study was performed to address the potential concern that commercially-bottled 100% fruit juices with “no sugar added” may contain higher sugar content than extracted juice of fresh fruit. The fruit juices that were tested included apple. grapefruit. orange. pineapple. pomegranate. red grape and white grape. All bottled juices and fresh fruits were purchased in Toledo. Ohio. USA during the winter of 2012. The fresh fruits were juiced and three samples were tested for sugar concentration using a Brix refractometer. The same testing protocol was also applied to the bottled 100% fruit juice. Application of the Mann-Whitney test on the experimental data demonstrated no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). The results suggested that the sugar content in the commercially bottled 100% fruit juice with the “no sugar added” label is an accurate representation of sugar content in the freshly-extracted juice of the corresponding fruit.,True,zK4SEf4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,34,https://www.scirp.org/html/6-2700518_24482.htm,7064041314733883240,/scholar?cites=7064041314733883240,,https://www.scirp.org/html/6-2700518_24482.htm,0,0,0
1077642,1000 human genomes carry widespread signatures of GC biased gene conversion,2018,Rajib Dutta and Arnab Saha-Mandal and Xi Cheng and Shuhao Qiu and Jasmine Serpen and Larisa Fedorova and Alexei Fedorov,19,BMC genomics,1,1-9,BioMed Central,GC-Biased Gene Conversion (gBGC) is one of the important theories put forward to explain profound long-range non-randomness in nucleotide compositions along mammalian chromosomes. Nucleotide changes due to gBGC are hard to distinguish from regular mutations. Here. we present an algorithm for analysis of millions of known SNPs that detects a subset of so-called “SNP flip-over” events representing recent gBGC nucleotide changes. which occurred in previous generations via non-crossover meiotic recombination. This algorithm has been applied in a large-scale analysis of 1092 sequenced human genomes. Altogether. 56.328 regions on all autosomes have been examined. which revealed 223.955 putative gBGC cases leading to SNP flip-overs. We detected a strong bias (11.7% ± 0.2% excess) in AT- > GC over GC- > AT base pair changes within the entire set of putative gBGC cases. On average. a human gamete acquires 7 SNP flip-over events. in which one allele is replaced by its complementary allele during the process of meiotic non-crossover recombination. In each meiosis event. on average. gBGC results in replacement of 7 AT base pairs by GC base pairs. while only 6 GC pairs are replaced by AT pairs. Therefore. every human gamete is enriched by one GC pair. Happening over millions of years of evolution. this bias may be a noticeable force in changing the nucleotide composition landscape along chromosomes.,True,zK4SEf4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,6,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4593-1,14939822248317362082,/scholar?cites=14939822248317362082,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-4593-1,0,0,0

HMOX2. AGT and ZMAT5. More than half of these SNPs were found to be rare ones with frequencies less than 1%. Linkage disequilibrium was determined for small subgroups of SNPs with higher frequencies (> 10%) that illustrated the presence of major haplotypes (3 in HMOX1. 3 in HMOX2. 5 in AGT and 5 in ZMAT5) which were found to be mutually exclusive. stable. and characterized by strong pairwise correlations (R 2> 0.8) between any two SNPs within the same haplotype. While a vast majority of the alleles within the population (> 90%) could be associated to a particular major haplotype. a small minority of them exhibited cross mixing of haplotypes due to recombination events. Special cases among 1000 Genomes genotype data were examined for possible short-range recombinations. where a span of 1-5 kb of a haplotype allele could be inserted inside another mutually exclusive haplotype allele. Such short-range exchanges of genetic materials may be explained by the formation of DNA heteroduplexes that form the crux of Biased Gene Conversion (BGC) theory. Our investigations for the aforementioned genes revealed a total of 67 cases involving possible heteroduplexes. 38 of them corresponded to conversion of G/C pairs to A/T pairs and 17 of them corresponded to conversion of A/T pairs to G/C pairs. We did not find strong evidence in support of BGC theory that heteroduplexes may cause a significant shift toward GC-richness.

De doelstelling is om de toestand en trend van ecosystemen en ecosysteemdiensten te beschrijven. te analyseren en waar mogelijk te karteren op schaal Vlaanderen.Ecosysteemdiensten (ESD) zijn de voordelen die de samenleving van ecosystemen ontvangt onder de vorm van materiële en immateriële goederen en diensten. Door de maatschappelijke effecten van die stroom van goederen en diensten (voedsel. veiligheid. gezondheid.…) beïnvloeden ecosysteemdiensten de omvang en de verdeling van onze economische welvaart en ons maatschappelijk welzijn. In zoverre ecosysteemdiensten onze welvaart en welzijn verhogen. spreken we van socio-economische baten. In zestien ESD-hoofdstukken worden vijf producerende diensten (productie van voedsel. hout. energiegewassen. water en wildbraad). tien regulerende diensten (reguleren van globaal klimaat. erosierisico. overstromingsrisico. kustbescherming. bodemkwaliteit. waterkwaliteit. luchtkwaliteit. geluid. bestuiving en natuurlijke plaagbestrijding) en één culturele dienst (ruimte voor buitenactiviteiten) geanalyseerd. Voor elke dienst wordt heel de ESD-cyclus systematisch doorlopen en waar mogelijk ook gekarteerd op schaal Vlaanderen. De opmaak van ESD-kaarten is enerzijds een expliciete Europese taakstelling in het kader van de biodiversiteitsconventie (COM (2011) 244 final).

The objective of this research is to identify immunogenic salivary gland proteins of Ae. aegypti against human blood sera of people living in endemic area. Protein profile from Salivary Glands (SG) of  Ae. aegypti was observed by 12% SDS-PAGE from lab. scale cultures and from landing populations. Identification of immunogenic proteins from both sample was carried out by using Western Blot Analysis after cross reaction of Salivary Gland Extract (SGE) with 3 different human sera: from DHF patients. healthy persons who were exposed to Ae. aegypti and healthy person who were likely not exposed. Sera from healthy people from non endemic areas and from infants were used as negative controls.

Anopheles spp. specifically transmits Plasmodium parasites which cause Malaria. while Aedes spp. transmits Dengue viruses that cause DHF. Bangsring. Banyuwangi is one of the endemic areas of Malaria. while Jember is one of endemic areas of DHF. Two species of Malaria vectors ie Anopheles vagus and Anopheles sundaicus have been found from several samplings which were conducted in Bangsring region. This mosquitoes have been previously identified as a major vector for malaria. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. which were major vectors for DHF. have been easily found in Jember during our sampling for any season of the year. This research wanted to differentiate the morphological characteristic of those vectors for malaria and Dengue. Adult mosquitoes can be distinguished from one another by characterizing their morphological features. Palpi. wings. and legs characteristics are commonly used as determination keys in Anopheles sp.. while thoraxes and legs characteristics are used as identification keys in Aedes sp. Morphological identification is considered as the basic necessity in understanding and determining bionomic of mosquito vector.

The warm subtropical climate of the Black Sea coastal area and inland regions of Georgia likely provides a favorable environment for various Vibrio species. From 2006 to 2009. the abundance. ecology. and diversity of clinically important Vibrio species were studied in different locations in Georgia and across seasons. Over a 33-month period. 1.595 presumptive Vibrio isolates were collected from the Black Sea (n=657) and freshwater lakes around Tbilisi (n=938). Screening of a subset of 440 concentrated and enriched water samples by PCR-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) detected the presence of DNA from eight clinically important Vibrio species: V. cholerae. V. parahaemolyticus. V. vulnificus. V. mimicus. V. alginolyticus. V. harveyi. V. metschnikovii. and V. cincinnatiensis. Almost ninety percent of PCR/ESI-MS samples positive for Vibrio species were collected from June through November. Three important human pathogenic Vibrio species (V. cholerae. V. parahaemolyticus. and V. vulnificus) were detected in 62.8%. 37.8%. and 21.4% of samples testing positive for vibrios. respectively. The results of these activities suggest that natural reservoirs for human-pathogenic Vibrios exist in Georgian aquatic environments. Water temperature at all sampling sites was positively correlated with the abundance of clinically important Vibrio spp. (except V. metschnikovii) and salinity was correlated with species composition at particular Black Sea sites as well as inland reservoirs.,True,v5gHBDEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,18,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2015.00232/full,503484173646039750,/scholar?cites=503484173646039750,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2015.00232/full,0,0,0

Here we provide the data on the Georgian environmental strains of V. cholerae isolated in 2006-2009 years from the coastal waters of the Black Sea and inland water reservoirs near Tbilisi. In total. 846 V. cholerae strains were collected from the water samples. most of them (705 strains) obtained from fresh water lakes. Isolation pattern of V. cholerae showed obvious seasonality with the highest isolation rates in late summer-early autumn. Twenty-nine isolates of V. cholerae were attributed to the O1 serotype based on serological studies and PCR identification and were further grouped by biochemical properties into classical and El Tor biotypes as well as hybrids. The study of antibiotic susceptibility profiles for V. cholerae isolates showed that 95% were sensitive to tetracycline. 91% to doxycycline. and 91% to ciprofloxacin. Interestingly. the freshwater isolates appeared to be more resistant to antibiotics than the Black Sea isolates. Among Black Sea isolates of V. cholerae toxigenic strains of O1 serotype revealed higher antibiotic resistance compared to non-O1/non-O139 isolates. In addition.

During 2006-2009. 71 phages lytic to V. cholerae were collected from these aquatic environments. The phage isolation rate was varying from 8% to 15%. depending on the sampling season and site. and the abundance of host bacteria. The majority of phages specific to V. cholerae were collected from freshwater sources. The phage isolation showed seasonal character covering warm period-from April to September. Based on basic characteristics of primary phage isolates (lytic spectrum. virion morphology and DNA restriction profiles) 23 V. cholerae-specific phages were selected for series of consecutive screenings. Comparatively wide spectrum of lytic activity was revealed in case of 14 phages specific to V. cholerae O1. and one phage-VchBS3. active against non-O1 V. cholerae.

However. little is known about how specific synaptic deficits alter neuromuscular transduction and muscle contractility that ultimately dictate behavioural output. Here we develop a system for detailed characterization of excitation-contraction coupling at Drosophila larval NMJs and demonstrate how specific synaptic and neuronal manipulations disrupt muscle contractility. Muscle contraction force increases with motoneuron stimulation frequency and duration. showing considerable plasticity between 5-40 Hz. while saturating above 50 Hz. Temperature is negatively correlated with muscle performance and enhanced at lower temperatures. A screen for modulators of muscle contractility led to the identification and characterization of the molecular and cellular pathway by which a specific FMRFa peptide. TPAEDFMRFa. increases muscle performance.

Selenium is an element of very great importance for the proper functioning of the human body. mainly due to its antioxidant properties. Selenium exhibits a preventive effect in the case of cardiovascular disease. the immune system. male infertility and inhibits the toxic action of other agents. Selenium is important for Hashimoto’s disease. Intake of selenium in the diet slows the aging process. The biological and toxicological effects of selenium strongly depend on its chemical form. Some organisms for example: plant. yeast. are capable of metabolizing low bioavailable selenium compounds (inorganic selenium) into its high bioavailable forms (organic selenium). Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the bio-transformation of selenium by Lactobacillus bacteria towards the characterisation of selenium metabolites. Material and Methods. The speciation of selenium was evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detector. The extraction of selenium species from lyophilized bacteria was executed with water. the mixture of lipase and protease. as well as lisozyme and sodium dodecyl sulphate. Results. All investigated bacteria strains cultivated in the presence of Na2SeO3 effectively uptake selenium. Surprisingly. none of the applied extraction media exhibited a strong power to release the majority of the uptaken selenium compounds.

Plant products remain the principal source of pharmaceutical drugs and agents used in traditional medicine [3]. With about half a million plants around the world. medicinal plants have a promising future [4]. Medicinal plants are considered as a rich resource of ingredients which can be used in drug development including pharmacopoeial. non-pharmacopoeial. or synthetic drugs [5].

In cancer cachexia skeletal muscle is incapable of regeneration. consequently. this observation remains unaccounted for. In C26-tumor bearing. cachectic mice. we observed muscle fibers with central nuclei in the absence of molecular markers of bona fide regeneration. These clustered. non-peripheral nuclei were present in NCAM-expressing muscle fibers. Since NCAM expression is upregulated in denervated myofibers. we searched for additional makers of denervation. including AchRs. MUSK. and HDAC. This last one being also consistently upregulated in cachectic muscles. correlated with an increase of central myonuclei. This held true in the musculature of patients suffering from gastrointestinal cancer. where a progressive increase in the number of central myonuclei was observed in weight stable and in cachectic patients. compared to healthy subjects. Based on all of the above. the presence of central myonuclei in cancer patients and animal models of cachexia is consistent with motor neuron loss or NMJ perturbation and could underlie a previously neglected phenomenon of denervation. rather than representing myofiber damage and regeneration in cachexia.

When cells turn malignant. cancer cell plasticity is affected and supported either by point mutations. preferential isoform selection. altered expression levels. or shifts to conformational equilibria of a secreted glycoprotein. Such changes are crucial in mediating altered extracellular signalling. metabolic behavior. and adhesion properties of cancer cells. It is therefore conceivable that interference with ERQC and/or ERAD can be used to selectively damage cancers. Indeed. inhibitors of the late stages of ERAD are already in the clinic against cancers such as multiple myeloma.

In vivo assays of candidate inhibitors in mammals are expensive and cannot be afforded at the preliminary stages of drug development programs. The strong conservation of the ERQC machinery across eukaryotes makes transgenic plants an attractive system for low-cost. easy and fast proof-of-concept screening of candidate ERQC inhibitors. The Arabidopsis thaliana immune response is mediated by glycoproteins. the folding of which is controlled by ERQC. We have used the plant response to bacterial peptides as a means of assaying an ERQC inhibitor in vivo. We show that the treatment of the plant with the iminosugar N B-DNJ. which is a known ER α-glucosidase inhibitor in mammals. influences the immune response of the plant to the bacterial peptide elf18 but not to the flagellin-derived flg22 peptide. In the N B-DNJ-treated plant. the responses to elf18 and flg22 treatments closely follow the ones observed for the ER α-glucosidase II impaired plant. At psl5-1.

It is conceivable that ERQC/ERAD would make attractive targets for the treatment of cell malignancies [10]. in that the fitness of the cancer cells. particularly those bearing a high secretory burden such as multiple myeloma cells [11]. is critically dependent on the functional integrity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). which in turn relies on ERQC/ERAD as ER stress-attenuating mechanisms. e therapeutic value of pharmacological chaperones (small molecules specifically stabilising a …,True,rTVi75kAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2020/1396429/,,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jo/2020/1396429/,0,0,0

1077743,EFR-Mediated Innate Immune Response in Arabidopsis thaliana is a Useful Tool for Identification of Novel ERQC Modulators,2019,Andrea Lia and Antonia Gallo and Lucia Marti and Pietro Roversi and Angelo Santino,10,Genes,1,15,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Plants offer a simpler and cheaper alternative to mammalian animal models for the study of endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein folding quality control (ERQC). In particular. the Arabidopsis thaliana (At) innate immune response to bacterial peptides provides an easy means of assaying ERQC function in vivo. A number of mutants that are useful to study ERQC in planta have been described in the literature. but only for a subset of these mutants the innate immune response to bacterial elicitors has been measured beyond monitoring plant weight and some physio-pathological parameters related to the plant immune response. In order to probe deeper into the role of ERQC in the plant immune response. we monitored expression levels of the Phosphate-induced 1 (PHI-1) and reticulin-oxidase homologue (RET-OX) genes in the At ER α-Glu II rsw3 and the At UGGT uggt1-1 mutant plants. in response to bacterial peptides elf18 and flg22. The elf18 response was impaired in the rsw3 but not completely abrogated in the uggt1-1 mutant plants. raising the possibility that the latter enzyme is partly dispensable for EF-Tu receptor (EFR) signaling. In the rsw3 mutant. seedling growth was impaired only by concomitant application of the At ER α-Glu II N B-DNJ inhibitor at concentrations above 500 nM. compatibly with residual activity in this mutant. The study highlights the need for extending plant innate immune response studies to assays sampling EFR signaling at the molecular level.

Radon has no color. odor or taste and is chemically inert. Its source is from uranium. As the uranium nucleus decays to form stable lead. a process taking many years. it changes from one radioactive element to another in a sequence known as the uranium decay cycle [2]. Radon is the largest and most variable contributor of public exposure to radiation. It is estimated that the annual effective dose by radon and its progeny from the inhalation of air is about 50% of natural public exposure to high levels of radon can cause lung cancer [3]. Radon can enter buildings through the floor. and in cases where ventilation is poor. the radon concentration can build up to high levels. exposing the occupants via inhalation [4]. Radon is responsible for the majority of the public exposure to naturally occurring radiation.

Inhalation of radon and its progeny can cause a significant health hazard. if it is present at enhanced levels beyond maximum permissible limit [1. 2]. There are various factors. which affect radon levels such as the difference in soil texture or porosity. The exact source of radon in soil air may be at a deep distant from the surface of the ground. The lower radon concentration in the top layer of the soil is attributable to the proximity of the soil to the atmosphere [3]. The radiation dose received by a dweller from all natural sources. about 52% is only due to breathing of radon and its short-lived daughter products [4]. It is well documented fact that the pathological effects like respiratory functional changes and the occurrence of lung cancer may be caused by the long exposure of a person to the high radon levels [5–8].

High population density and enhanced agriculture and industrial activity are main reasons for pollution and degradation of vegetation in these areas. Accumulation of heavy metals in forage plants and subsequent transfer of metals along the food chain might have a negative impact on the health of the population. The areas for sample collection were as follows: Point 1 (Atyrau. farm. Ulan). Point 2 (Kulsary. v. Turgysba) and Point 3 (v. Inder. farm. Isayev). The ability for heavy metal accumulation was different in various plant species. It was revealed that Artemisia terraealbae was able to accumulate the highest concentration of the heavy metals namely lead. zinc. nickel and manganese compared with the other species. Tamarix ramosissima and Ceratocarpus arenarius were distinctive as having the least amount of heavy metals compared with the other species growing in similar environmental conditions. In all the studied areas the content of heavy metals was within the maximum permissible level.

BAS,Trans-Ili Alatau is the central ridge of the Northern Tien Shan Mountains. It has one of the richest floras. which reflects. with a few exceptions. the flora of whole Northern Tien Shan. However. the strong anthropogenic pressure on natural biocoenoses in the region leads to the destruction of entire communities and populations of plants. The mountain forest belt. located closely to Almaty city and subjected to the most intensive development. suffers particularly from excessive human intervention. First the grassy tier. then the shrubs and undergrowth of forest trees are destroyed due to immoderate recreational load. In addition. losses of many indigenous species and their replacement by introduced weed species are observed. Therefore. the biodiversity of fruit plants was studied in the Aksay gorge of Trans-Ili Alatau. Totally 74 plant species from 58 genera and 27 families were detected at monitoring sites. The most representative family in the floodplain communities of Aksay gorge was Rosaceae (12 genera and 18 species). whereas from 15other families only one species was recorded. The Aksai gorge is characterized by intra-zonal plant communities. descending along the floodplain of the Aksai River.,True,QMn8rFgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,http://acta-zoologica-bulgarica.eu/downloads/acta-zoologica-bulgarica/2018/supplement-11-149-153.pdf,2128034670828397249,/scholar?cites=2128034670828397249,,http://acta-zoologica-bulgarica.eu/downloads/acta-zoologica-bulgarica/2018/supplement-11-149-153.pdf,0,0,0

Portugal has a potentially promising common bean germplasm. resulting from more than five centuries of natural adaptation and farmers’ selection. Nevertheless. limited characterization of this resource hampers its exploitation by breeding programs. To support a more efficient conservation of the national germplasm and promote its use in crop improvement. we performed. for the first time. a simultaneous molecular marker (21 microsatellites and a DNA marker for phaseolin-type) and seed and plant morphological characterization (14 traits) of 175 accessions from Portuguese mainland and islands traditional bean-growing regions. A total of 188 alleles were identified and an average genetic distance of 0.193 was estimated among accessions. To relate the Portuguese germplasm with the global common bean diversity. 17 wild relatives and representative accessions from the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools were evaluated at the molecular level. No correlation was detected between the variability found and the geographic origin of accessions. Structure analysis divided the collection into three main clusters. Most of the Portuguese accessions grouped with the race representatives and wild relatives from the Andean region. One third of the national germplasm had admixed genetic origin and might represent putative hybrids among gene pools from the two original centers of domestication.

1077799,Can niche dynamics and distribution modeling predict the success of invasive species management using biocontrol? Insights from Acacia longifolia in Portugal,2020,Marco Dinis and Joana Raquel Vicente and Nuno César De Sá and Francisco Alejandro López-Núñez and Elizabete Marchante and Hélia Marchante,8,Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,,358,Frontiers,Biological invasions are among the major contemporary threats to biodiversity. Biocontrol has a long history as a safe and effective strategy for the control of invasive species in several world regions. yet the life history and ecological requirements of biocontrol agents are often poorly understood. Species distribution models and assessments of niche overlap and dynamics constitute a way to quantify and compare ecological niches and are widely used for predicting biological invasions. While these tools can also be valuable to predict the effectiveness of biocontrol programs and anticipate whether biocontrol agents can establish on areas targeted for control. they remain underutilized for this purpose. In this work. species distribution models and comparisons of niche dynamics are used to predict the success of the ongoing biocontrol program for Acacia longifolia in Portugal. and potentially along the Mediterranean Basin. using the Australian gall-forming wasp Trichilogaster acaciaelongifoliae. previously released in South Africa. Niches of both the invasive plant and the biocontrol agent were found to be highly similar and to remain conserved through the introduction process. Distribution models identify suitable climatic areas for A. longifolia in 19% of the Mediterranean Basin and predict successful establishment of T. acaciaelongifoliae in 41% of the suitable area for A. longifolia. despite excluding a few locations where very recent establishment occurred. These results allow us to quantify the risk of future A. longifolia invasion and potential success of biocontrol. as well as establish a comparative framework for similar programs being considered …,True,BwM3jQkAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8b8/c86a4a04b7135e88303ad4825d5541178883.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d8b8/c86a4a04b7135e88303ad4825d5541178883.pdf,0,0,0

This is partially due to the complexity of the evolutionary histories of North African taxa. marked by periods of connectivity with southern Europe which allowed colonization across the Mediterranean in both directions (Hsü et al.. 1973; Krijgsman et al.. 1999; Duggen et al.. 2003; Velo-Antón et al.. 2015a). Another contributing factor to diversification in the region was the complex succession of climatic oscillations during the Quaternary (Street & Gasse. 1981; Quezel & Barbero. 1993). forcing species to adapt. pursue suitable climate through successive range shifts. or persist in climatically stable refugia for long term periods (Cosson et al.. 2005).The complex topography of the region likely produced similar patterns to those found in Europe (Schmitt et al.. 2009; Mouret et al.. 2011). with populations tracking climate fluctuations and finding refugia by performing altitudinal shifts along mountain slopes (eg Beukema et al.. 2010; Nicolas et al.. 2015; Veríssimo et al.. 2016).

Nowadays it represents 80% of the National grain legume income (INE). However. common bean is vulnerable to several diseases. such as rust and powdery mildew. which leads to significant yield losses. limiting its cultivation. The very diverse bean landraces that are still grown at farmers’ fields represent unique and valuable genetic resource for breeding and disease resistance improvement. From the Portuguese Germplasm Bank (BPGV) common bean collection. 89 traditional landraces were evaluated for resistance to powdery mildew and 92 to rust fungi in seedling tests. under controlled conditions. Powdery mildew disease severity (DS) was assessed 7 and 15 days after inoculation (DAI) as the percentage of leaf tissue covered by mildew colonies. Many landraces showed intermediate levels of DS (6-25%) when compared to the susceptible check. 3 had no visible symptoms and 12 showed low levels of DS (0-5%) with hypersensitive resistant reaction. R ust infection type (IT) was analyzed 15 DAI using a 0-4 scale and a range of patterns of disease reaction was observed in the collection. DS was also estimated. with 42 landraces showing low values (DS<5%) and IT=4. indicative of partial resistance.

Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was introduced in Portugal more than 5 centuries ago and due to its high organoleptic and nutritional value. it became a popular crop all over the country. Very diverse landraces are still widely grown at the farmersʼ fields where they are commonly found in intercropping associations with other crops. such as maize (Zea mays L.). Nevertheless. several constraints to bean yield stability exist. such as susceptibility to several major fungal diseases. Rusts and powdery mildew fungi. foliar biotrophic pathogens. are among the limiting factors of common bean production. Identification and characterization of sources and mechanisms of resistance to use in plant breeding is regarded as a cost efficient method. Understanding the detected resistance genetic basis will facilitate the resistance handling by the breeders. The study of the genetic diversity existing among the different sources of resistance will be fundamental to select the parental lines to use on the development of contrasting populations needed for the genetic resistance studies. During a field expedition to the Central region of Portugal. members of our team collected several bean landraces adapted to intercropping and low-input farming systems.

Here. we used experimental and computational approaches to dissect the quantitative mechanisms underlying the ordered degradation of the substrates of the ubiquitin ligase APC/CCdc20. a key regulator of chromosome segregation in mitosis. We show experimentally that the rate of catalysis varies with different substrates of APC/CCdc20. Using a computational model based on multi-step ubiquitination. we then show how changes in the interaction between a single substrate and APC/CCdc20 can alter the timing of degradation onset relative to APC/CCdc20 activation. while ensuring a fast degradation rate. Degradation timing and dynamics depend on substrate affinity for the enzyme as well as the catalytic rate at which the substrate is modified. When two substrates share the same pool of APC/CCdc20. their relative enzyme affinities and rates of catalysis influence the partitioning of APC/CCdc20 among substrates. resulting in substrate competition. Depending on how APC/CCdc20 is partitioned among its substrates. competition can have minor or major effects on the degradation of certain substrates. We show experimentally that increased expression of the early APC/CCdc20 substrate Clb5 does not delay the degradation of the later substrate securin. arguing against a role for competition with Clb5 in establishing securin degradation timing. The degradation timing of APC/CCdc20 substrates depends on the multi-step nature of ubiquitination. differences in substrate-APC/CCdc20 interactions. and competition among substrates …,True,DJyRDPgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,16,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0205-6,9351572072666764890,/scholar?cites=9351572072666764890,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-015-0205-6,0,0,0

We demonstrate that such networks can undergo a bifurcation to a state where a stable fixed point and a stable limit cycle coexist. At the bifurcation point the period of the oscillations diverges. Further. intrinsic noise can make the system switch between oscillatory state and the stationary state spontaneously. We find that this switching also occurs in previous models of circadian clocks that use this combination of positive and negative feedbacks.

1077830,Regulating ER protein homeostasis by differentially processing mRNAs,2018,Weihan Li,,,,,,The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding capacity is balanced with the protein folding burden to prevent accumulation of un- or misfolded proteins. The ER-membrane resident kinase/RNase Ire1 maintains ER protein homeostasis by initiating two distinct mRNA processing programs. First. in both metazoans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ire1 catalyzes the non-conventional cytoplasmic mRNA splicing of XBP1 (metazoans) or HAC1 (S. cerevisiae)—thereby initiating a transcriptional response that increases the ER folding capacity. Second. in metazoans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Ire1 selectively degrades ER-localized mRNAs—thereby post-transcriptionally reducing the ER’s protein folding burden. Thus. Ire1 orthologs in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe are specialized to only one of the two functional outputs. while Ire1 in metazoans can perform both. Here. we show that the respective Ire1 orthologs have become specialized for their functional outputs by divergence of their RNase specificities. In addition.

In metazoan cells. the Ire1 branch of the UPR initiates two functional outputs-non-conventional mRNA splicing and selective mRNA decay (RIDD). By contrast. Ire1 orthologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe are specialized for only splicing or RIDD. respectively. The functional specialization lies in Ire19s RNase activity. which is either stringently splice-site specific (as in S. cerevisiae) or promiscuous (as in S. pombe). Here. we developed an assay that reports on Ire19s RNase promiscuity.

Recent monitoring has shown that tens of thousands of birds land on ponds containing this water annually. creating an urgent need to understand its effects on bird health. We emulated the repeated. short-term exposures that migrating water birds are thought to experience by exposing pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) to recycled oil sands process-affected water (OSPW). As indicators of health. we measured a series of physiological (electrolytes. metabolites. enzymes. hormones. and blood cells) and toxicological (metals and minerals) variables.

Unfortunately. little BBS coverage is available in the boreal forest. where increasing concern over the status of species breeding there has increased interest in northward expansion of the BBS. However. high disturbance rates in the boreal forest may complicate roadside monitoring. If the roadside sampling frame does not capture variation in disturbance rates because of either road placement or the use of roads for resource extraction. biased trend estimates might result. In this study. we examined roadside bias in the proportional representation of habitat disturbance via spatial data on forest “loss.” forest fires. and anthropogenic disturbance. In each of 455 BBS routes. the area disturbed within multiple buffers away from the road was calculated and compared against the area disturbed in degree blocks and BBS strata. We found a nonlinear relationship between bias and distance from the road. suggesting forest loss and forest fires were underrepresented below 75 and 100 m. respectively. In contrast. anthropogenic disturbance was overrepresented at distances below 500 m and underrepresented thereafter. After accounting for distance from road. BBS routes were reasonably representative of the degree blocks they were within. with only a few strata showing biased representation. In general. anthropogenic disturbance is overrepresented in southern strata. and forest fires are underrepresented in almost all strata.

Canada,2018,Steven Van Wilgenburg and Keith Hobson and Kevin Kardynal and Elizabeth Beck,13,Avian Conservation and Ecology,1,,The Resilience Alliance,The boreal forest provides important breeding habitat for many migratory songbirds; however. changes in disturbance regimes have led to concern for populations breeding there. Monitoring data to track changes in boreal forest bird populations are scarce. Therefore. we repeated surveys at historic research sites in aspen-dominated boreal mixedwood forest in central Saskatchewan. Canada. to test for changes in abundance in different forest age classes. We used GIS analyses and habitat data to test whether observed changes in abundance were correlated with within-stand changes in habitat over approximately 20 years. Eight of the ten species examined showed evidence for change in abundance. Trends from our study showed little correlation with regional trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and generally displayed greater magnitude and precision. Species associated with closed-canopy forests declined more rapidly than suggested by BBS surveys. whereas species associated with disturbance generally had opposite trends to the BBS. Decreased abundance of species such as Swainson’s Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata) correlated with loss of forest cover from fire or harvesting. Conversely. changes in the abundance of species associated with early successional forest and canopy gaps were primarily correlated with within-stand disturbances (eg. Magnolia Warbler [Setophaga magnolia]) and changes in the proportion of the stands composed of conifers (eg. White-throated Sparrow [Zonotrichia albicollis]).

Philippines using differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR),2016,AB Baloloy and AC Blanco and BS Gana and RC Sta Ana and LC Olalia,42,"The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences",,173,Copernicus GmbH,The Philippines has a booming sugarcane industry contributing about PHP 70 billion annually to the local economy through raw sugar. molasses and bioethanol production (SRA. 2012). Sugarcane planters adapt different farm practices in cultivating sugarcane. one of which is cane burning to eliminate unwanted plant material and facilitate easier harvest. Information on burned sugarcane extent is significant in yield estimation models to calculate total sugar lost during harvest. Pre-harvest burning can lessen sucrose by 2.7%-5% of the potential yield (Gomez. et al 2006; Hiranyavasit. 2016). This study employs a method for detecting burn sugarcane area and determining burn severity through Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) using Landsat 8 Images acquired during the late milling season in Tarlac. Philippines. Total burned area was computed per burn severity based on pre-fire and post-fire images. Results show that 75.38% of the total sugarcane fields in Tarlac were burned with post-fire regrowth; 16.61% were recently burned; and only 8.01% were unburned. The monthly dNBR for February to March generated the largest area with low severity burn (1.436 ha) and high severity burn (31.14 ha) due to pre-harvest burning. Post-fire regrowth is highest in April to May when previously burned areas were already replanted with sugarcane. The maximum dNBR of the entire late milling season (February to May) recorded larger extent of areas with high and low post-fire regrowth compared to areas with low. moderate and high burn severity.

The current microclimate (Scenario 1) and two potential future urbanization scenarios in Lower Session Road. Baguio City were simulated with ENVI-met. The future scenarios include the removal of the Balete trees in the median strip (Scenario 2). and removal of some pine trees and addition of new buildings in the study site (Scenario 3). Remotelysensed data were used in creating the primary model inputs including the initial built-up layer from PlanetScope green-based built-up index (VgNIR-BI). and digital elevation models (DEM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps derived from unmanned aerial system (UAS) for tree canopy mapping. The horizontal variations in air temperature were observed by selecting three subsites with different proximity to the adjusted variables. while vertical analysis was done by comparing the temperature values from the near-ground up to the 20m height range. Very minimal temperature change (0 C to-0.01 C) was observed between the current and simulated scenarios when average temperature of the whole site is obtained. However. temperature variations were better observed with per-subsite analysis as the effects of the adjusted variables are seen to be localized and restricted only to the surrounding thermal condition.

PHILIPPINES.,2019,MM Tinoy and AU Novero and KP Landicho and AB Baloloy and AC Blanco,,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing & Spatial Information Sciences",,,,This study produced spatiotemporal hot and cold spot occurrence maps for Davao City for the period 1994-2019 using land surface temperature (LST) images. Urban heat is theorized to have been affected by some. if not all. of the following impact factors: air pollutant concentrations/particulate matter (PM10). vegetation “abundance”(using EVI). building “density”(NDBI). albedo. topography. and population density. A mobile traverse sampling was performed in the morning and afternoon of 15 April 2019 to measure PM10 in the city’s identified hot spots. The remaining factors were generated from imagery (ie. Landsat 8. Synthetic Aperture Radar) and obtained from the Philippine Statistics Authority. These factors were analyzed against the LST which was obtained through Project GUHeat’s methodology. The relationships between the factors and LST were studied through multiple and quantile regression models (MRM & QRM). Results showed that variable PM10 does not have any significance in the MRM. Meanwhile. QRM were fitted to different quantile values. namely: 10th. 25th. 50th. 75th. and 90th. It is only at the 90th quantile where all the independent variables are good predictors for the LST. Albedo is the most important predictor for the LST at 10th quantile whereas Elev for the 25th quantile. However. when LST is at the 50th. 75th. and 90th quantiles NDBI is the most significant variable at predicting LST.

PHILIPPINES.,2019,A Baloloy and JA Cruz and AC Blanco and NV Lubrica and CJ Valdez and EP Cajucom,,"International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing & Spatial Information Sciences",,,,Urbanization can be observed through the occurrence of land-use changes as more land is being transformed and developed for urban use. One of the Philippine cities with high rate of urbanization is Baguio City. known for having a subtropical highland climate. To understand the spatiotemporal relationship between urbanization and temperature. this study aims to analyze the correlation of urban extent with land surface and air temperature in Baguio City using satellite-based built-up extents. land surface temperature (LST) maps. and weather station-recorded air temperature data. Built-up extent layers were derived from three satellite images: Landsat. RapidEye and PlanetScope. Land-use land cover (LULC) maps were generated from Landsat images using biophysical indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI); while RapidEye and PlanetScope built-up extent maps were generated by applying the visible green-based built-up index (VgNIR-BI). Mean LST values from 1988 to 2018 during the dry and wet seasons were calculated from the Landsat-retrieved surface temperature layers. The result of the study shows that the increase in the built-up extent significantly intensified the LST during the dry season which was observed in all satellite data-derived built-up maps: RapidEye+ PlanetScope (2012-2018; r= 0.88).

Investigating the pattern of vegetation change over the world in recent decades is necessary for obtaining a greater understanding of global change and the corresponding vegetation response. Vegetation coverage change is also a very important indication of the ecological environment change. A widely known digital change detection technique is using remotely sensed data based on the comparison of sequential data taken from the same area and on the display of the changes and their locations.Because of improved remote sensing. satellites Earth observation data are available for longer year scales. Identifying major trends and changes in vegetation cover over most of the land surface is now possible and easier.

1077862,Genetic variation in insectary-produced biological control species,2013,Kevin M Heinz and Dianna Krejsa and Raul F Medina,,INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF ARTHROPODS,,,,Genetic diversity is thought to be essential in allowing a population to adapt to its surroundings and remain a competitive and effective species (Baker et al. 2003. Hopper et al. 1993). In insectaries. genetic variation may potentially be reduced or lost as a result of bottlenecks. assortative mating. genetic drift. and/or inbreeding (Hopper et al. 1993). Reduced genetic variation in insectary-produced natural enemies could make them ineffective for field applications. Without a certain degree of genetic variation. natural enemies may not adapt well to environmental changes (or to diverse release sites) or to subtle variation in their hosts’ traits. Though a population with little to no variation may have achieved maximal fitness in a static. stable environment. they may not be useful once the diverse demands of field applications are placed on them. If they cannot perform their life history duties well. insectaries. clients. and crops suffer. With the significant costs caused by pest organisms. as well as the cost of pesticides (both monetarily and environmentally) augmentative biological control is an optimal mode of pest management. and optimal insects for this task are thus desired. If there is a strong need for adaptation between a biological control species and its host or a biological control species and its environment in order for it to perform optimally. preserving genetic diversity is important (Roderick et al. 2003). Our study aimed to shed some light on the state of genetic variation of biological control agents within insectaries.

Oxyg. Species,,81-95,,Oxidative stress is a critical factor for the development of cancer via inducing DNA mutations. damage. and genome instability. Different signaling pathways associated with the progression of cancer can modulate the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The level of intracellular ROS is usually high in cancer cells compared to different normal cell types due to abnormal functionality of different genes and perturbed metabolic activity facilitating extensive cellular proliferation. Among a few therapeutic options practiced recently. chemotherapy is the most effective so far. Despite its antitumor efficacy. treatment procedures of chemotherapy have several major side effects and this provokes the scientists for developing novel therapeutic option with minimum toxicity. Different naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds exhibit potential anti-oxidative. anti-inflammatory. and pro-apoptotic effect in several anticancer studies.

1077885,Carbohydrate specificity of lectin. purified from the fruiting bodies of Mycena pura /Fr./ Kumm. and its use in histochemical investigation,2009,VO Antonyuk and AM Yastchenko and RV Antonyuk and NO Ambarova,25,Biopolymers & Cell,6,466,Natsional'na Akademiya Nauk Ukrainy-National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,Aim. The purpose of this investigation was to research carbohydrate specificity of a new lectin from fruiting body of Mycena pura and possibilities of its application in histochemical studies. Methods. The lectin has been purified by affinity chromatography on «оvomucine». The lectin carbohydrate specificity has been determined by a reaction of inhibiting haemagglutination by haptens. Histological materials were fixed in 4% neutral formalin solution. Alkaline phosphatase was revealed in the cryostat unfixed microscopical sections. Results. The lectin yield from fresh fruit bodies of raw material was 9 mg/kg. Mol. mass of the lectin is 40 kDa. The lectin poorly interacted with D-glucose and D-mannose in contrast to lectins from Pisum sativum and Leucojum vernum. The peculiarity of this lectin is its strong interaction with alkaline phosphatase. the highest among twenty tested lectins. However. the receptors for Mycena lectin binding in mammalian tissues are not limited by this enzyme being presented also by glycoconjugates of another structure. as it was shown for fetus calf small intestine and kidney of rat. Conclusions. An important role in the lectin interaction with glycoproteins probably belongs to the disaccharide links of GlcNAcb (1-2) Mana (1-6) or GlcNAcb (1-2) Mana (1-2). which not necessarily are terminal.,True,04Y1AnUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,13,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5fec/35fb34c9812bb2873d4d28fb6a068cb48367.pdf,8552375587768463621,/scholar?cites=8552375587768463621,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5fec/35fb34c9812bb2873d4d28fb6a068cb48367.pdf,0,0,0

Fr.] has been purified with output≈ 60 mg/kg of raw material. Method of purification included the sedimentation of viscous polysaccharide by ethanol. removal of ethanol by dialysis. ionexchange chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl and affinity chromatography on Sepharose 6B column with immobilized mannose-specific Polygonatum multiflorum lectin. The obtained lectin preparation (abbreviated PIFA) is a glycoprotein with 6.5±1% carbohydrates. molecular mass of 64 kDa. consisting of four identical subunits. Lectin interacted only with N-acetyl-lactosamine and glycoproteins that contained Galβ1-4GlcNAc disaccharide moieties; agglutinated erythrocytes of dog. sheep and horse. but not of humans. The specificity of PIFA binding to tissue samples of the rat has been investigated. Lectin selectively reacted with gastric parietal cells. submandibular salivary gland duct cells. In the kidney. PIFA labeled epithelial cells of renal tubules. collecting ducts. nuclei of podocytes and mesangiocytes. It was also revealed selective lectin binding to Purkinje cells of cerebellum. Brush border of absorptive cells in small intestine was also strongly reactive. while goblet cells both in small and large intestine were completely negative. Considering similarities in carbohydrate specificity of Paxillus involutus (PIFA) and Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA-120). histochemical reactivity of these two lectins was compared.

That allowed obtaining lectin with electrophoretic purity and yielding of 42 mg÷ kg roe. Electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol showed one band with molecular mass 15 kDa. whereas in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol. CCRA exposed band with molecular mass 60 kDa. The resulting lectin was thermostable. withstanding heating to 75 C for 15 minutes. without noticeable loss of hemagglutinating activity. Gel column chromatography on Toyopearl HW-55 determined the lectin molecular weight of 120±3 kDa. For the lectin activity. divalent metal ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) were not necessary. CCRA showed the best agglutination titer with pigeon erythrocytes. weaker-with rabbit and dog erythrocytes. and significantly weaker-with human and rat erythrocytes. CCRA lectin was specific to N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and D-galactose group carbohydrates. The best lectin activity inhibition possessed alkaline phosphatase of calf intestine and fetuin.

1077890,Lectin histochemistry of intestinal carbohydrate determinants in representatives of different classes of vertebrates,2015,RV Antonyuk and AD Lutsyk,9,Morphologia,4,7-20,,Background. Glycoproteins (including mucin) of vertebrate’s intestine play an important role in its protection against chemical and mechanical damage and bacterial attacks. Their diversity was described by many authors. but understanding of their chemical structure remains far from complete. These data can be extended by methods of lectin histochemistry. Objective. To investigate the rearrangement of intestinal carbohydrate determinants in the context of vertebrate evolution. Methods. Distal and proximal segments of small and large intestines of humans (Homo sapiens). laboratory (Wistar) rat (Rattus norvegicus f. Domesticus). rock pigeon (Columba livia). smooth snake (Coronella austriaca). common frog (Rana temporaria). common carp (Cyprinus carpio) that belong to different classes of vertebrates were taken for the experiment. Nine lectins with different carbohydrate specificities: wheat germ (WGA). potato (STA). elderberry bark (SNA). golden rain bark (LABA). locust bark (RPBA). roe carp (CCRA). Phaseolus vulgaris erytroagglutinin (PHA-E). peanut (PNA) and jack fruit (AIA)–were included into the panel. Results. Differences in lectin staining between small and large intestine were more pronounced in higher (human. rat) than in lower (frog. carp) vertebrates. Lectin receptors were more diverse in frog intestine in comparison with carp. Lectin interaction with mucin secretory granules of smooth snake revealed lack of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues and abundance of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine determinants. Conclusion.

Ferragnes. accumulation of dry matter. sugars and fat,1999,Anđelko Vrsaljko,64,Agriculturae Conspectus Scientificus,1,5-20,,In the ecological conditions of Ravni Kotari. the two years research was carried out into the growth of almonds. the accumulation of dry substances in the almond fruit. as well as the accumulation of sugar and fat in the almond kernel. There are three phases in the growth curve: the phase of intensified growth (completed in 45-50 days) when the al-mond reaches up to 90% of its size and weight. then follows the phase of stagnation (60-65 days) and the phase of slow growth. which finishes about 75 days after blos-soming. when the fruit reaches its full size and weight. The accumulation of dry substance first occurs in the egzocarp-mezocarp. so that following this. would develop more intensively in the kernel 57 days after the fruit germination up until then. there was 90% moisture in the kernel. The level of carbohydrate in the kernel is the highest in the intensive growth phase. following a gradual diminishing. especially with the onset of the intensive biosynthesis of fat. In this period we can find only traces of directly produced sugars. Saccharose makes up 90-96% of the melting fraction of sugar. Among polysaccharides a presence of starch was noted. The level of lipids at the time of harvesting is between 43-49% of the dry substance. In the dynamic of lipid accumulation there are four phases: from the set of the fruit June (there is about 8% of dry substance). June when the lipid level remains unchanged. July when the lipid level reaches 14-18% of the dry substance and August when the level of July triples.

Since the initial assumption was that agritourism in this County was not sufficiently developed but there was a potential. an area of the federal state of Bavaria in Germany was taken for comparison as an example of successful agritourist destination from which Split-Dalmatia County can learn. The research confirmed initial assumptions and showed that besides the existing natural. cultural and historical potential Split–Dalmatia Country still needed significant development in terms of agritourism in order to reach the status of true and serious agritourist destination. Comparing the current situation in agritourism with that Bavaria it is clear that this destination is merely at the beginning of the real agritourism development and that is yet to decide for it and in that sense confirm the decision by strengthening organizational structures that will provide support and regulate that development.

Among the most massive were poisonings by bacteria originating from spinach in the Unated States of America. from mung beans in Japan. as well as an epidemic caused by Escherichia coli from pumpkin in Germany. Unfortunately. hemolytic uraemic syndrome caused by Escherichia coli in Germany affected 3.950 people in 2011. of whom 53 died. Although vegetables do not represent a natural habitat for bacteria that cause diseases in humans. it is clear that certain groups of human pathogenic microorganisms can find their ecological niches in plant production systems. Ways of contaminating plants with these bacteria are poorly understood. It is assumed that fertilization and irrigation with untreated water are some of the possible ways of transmitting pathogenic bacteria to agricultural crops. The aim of the research was to indicate the possible presence of potentially pathogenic strains of bacteria on certain vegetable crops (lettuce. spinach. tomato. paprika. carrot. parsley. red onion) in the northeastern part of Republika Srpska (Bosnia and Herzegovina).

Agrobacterium tumefaciens,2018,Hedieh Attai and Maarten Boon and Kenya Phillips and Jean-Paul Noben and Rob Lavigne and Pamela Brown,9,Frontiers in Microbiology,,1861,Frontiers,Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a plant pathogen that causes crown gall disease. leading to damage of agriculturally-important crops. As part of an effort to discover new phages that can potentially be used as biocontrol agents to prevent crown gall disease. we isolated and characterized phage Atu_ph07 from Sawyer Creek in Springfield. MO. using the virulent Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 as a host. After surveying its host range. we found that Atu_ph07 exclusively infects Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Time-lapse microscopy of A. tumefaciens cells subjected to infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with Atu_ph07 reveals that lysis occurs within 3 h. Transmission electron microscopy of partially purified virions shows that Atu_ph07 has a typical Myoviridae morphology with an icosahedral head (147 nm). long tail (130 nm). and tail fibers. The sequenced genome of Atu_ph07 is 490 kbp. defining it as a jumbo phage. The Atu_ph07 genome contains 714 open reading frames (ORFs). including 390 ORFs with no discernable homologs in other lineages (ORFans). 214 predicted conserved hypothetical proteins with no assigned function. and 110 predicted proteins with a functional annotation based on similarity to conserved proteins.

Brown,11,Viruses,6,,,In the rhizosphere. bacteria–phage interactions are likely to have important impacts on the ecology of microbial communities and microbe–plant interactions. To better understand the dynamics of Agrobacteria–phage interactions. we have isolated diverse bacteriophages which infect the bacterial plant pathogen. Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Here. we complete the genomic characterization of Agrobacterium tumefaciens phages Atu_ph04 and Atu_ph08. Atu_ph04—a T4-like phage belonging to the Myoviridae family—was isolated from waste water and has a 143.349 bp genome that encodes 223 predicted open reading frames (ORFs). Based on phylogenetic analysis and whole-genome alignments. Atu_ph04 is a member of a newly described T4 superfamily that contains other Rhizobiales-infecting phages. Atu_ph08. a member of the Podoviridae T7-like family. was isolated from waste water. has a 59.034 bp genome. and encodes 75 ORFs. Based on phylogenetic analysis and whole-genome alignments. Atu_ph08 may form a new T7 superfamily which includes Sinorhizobium phage PCB5 and Ochrobactrum phage POI1126. Atu_ph08 is predicted to have lysogenic activity. as we found evidence of an integrase and several transcriptional repressors with similarity to proteins in transducing phage P22.

1077922,Phage Cocktails can Prevent the Evolution of Phage-Resistant Enterococcus,2021,Stephen Wandro and Pooja Ghatbale and Hedieh Attai and Clark Hendrickson and Cyril Samillano and Joy Suh and David T Pride and Katrine Whiteson,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Antibiotic resistant Enterococcus infections are a major health crisis that requires the development of alternative therapies. Phage therapy could be an alternative to antibiotics and has shown promise in in vitro and in early clinical studies. Phage therapy is often deployed as a cocktail of phages. but there is little understanding of how to most effectively combine phages. Here we utilized a collection of 20 Enterococcus phages to test principles of phage cocktail design and determine the phenotypic effects of evolving phage resistance in Enterococcus isolates that were susceptible or resistant to antibiotics (e.g.. Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE)). We tested the ability of each phage to clear Enterococcus host cultures and prevent the emergence of phage resistant Enterococcus. We found that some phages which were ineffective individually were effective at clearing the bacterial culture when used in cocktails. To understand the dynamics within phage cocktails. we used qPCR to track which phages increased in abundance in each cocktail. and saw dynamics ranging from one dominant phage to even phage growth. Further. we isolated several phage-resistant mutants to test for altered Vancomycin sensitivity. We found that mutants tended to have no change or slightly increased resistance to Vancomycin. By demonstrating the efficacy of phage cocktails in suppressing growth of antibiotic susceptible and VRE clinical isolates when exposed to phages. this work will help to inform cocktail design for future phage therapy applications.,True,nqeCeKkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.27.428553v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/01/28/2021.01.27.428553.full.pdf,0,0,0
1077923,From unique killers to a jumbo genome-isolation and characterization of phages that infect the plant pathogen. Agrobacterium tumefaciens,2019,Hedieh Attai,,,,,,Bacteriophages and their lytic peptides can protect plants from phytopathogens such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens. To better understand mechanisms of phagemediated host killing. we isolated and characterized five lytic bacteriophages with activity against A. tumefaciens C58. These phages come in different shapes and sizes—from T7-like phages with podoviral morphology and isometric heads to T4-like phages with myoviral morphology and a contractile tail—and exhibit varying host ranges and killing efficiencies. The smallest Agrobacterium phages are phiKMVlike phages in the T7 superfamily that are efficient at killing their hosts. Their lethality can be attributed to their expression of a unique endolysin. called Phage Peptidoglycan Hydrolase (PPH). The atypical domain structure of PPH. along with the absence of obvious accessory proteins. suggest PPH may function independently to mediate host cell lysis. Contrary to the narrow host range of the phage. expression of PPH from an inducible promoter inhibits cell growth and blocks cell division in a broad range of bacteria including Agrobacterium. Sinorhizobium. and Escherichia strains. Another member of the Podoviridae family. Atu_ph08. carries remnants of a lysogen and shares 60.2% identity with Agrobacterium genomospecies 3. The T4-like phages in our collection are not potent killers. Atu_ph04 is unique T4-like phage that is similar to a group of rhizophages. The largest Agrobacterium phage. Atu_ph07. has a head diameter of 146 nm. an extended tail length of 136 nm. and a genome of 490 kbp.

However. ensuring high-entropy secret bits from the CIR may not be always feasible. including in IoT and/or indoor environments. where the coherence time may not be easy to obtain. or mobility is limited. Many techniques have been developed to resolve the above problems. including privacy amplification for higher entropy output. and pre-processing for data distillation. In this paper. we develop a framework for extracting entropy from sequentially arriving channel impulse response observation samples. and propose algorithms for both online and offline versions of the problem. We fully characterize the optimal solutions to these problems through a series of analytic results. and establish the …,True,EqVPnnwAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8718095/,4895087026696435441,/scholar?cites=4895087026696435441,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/5449605/8718089/08718095.pdf,0,0,0

Hence multicast could potentially improve network and user performance significantly. which triggered our study on Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN). In this paper. we first derive a realistic MBSFN Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) analytical model. with multiple antennas. multipath channel. and equalizer considered. Then through comprehensive system level simulations. we compare MBSFN and unicast in terms of resource efficiency v.s. throughput. as well as outage probability.

As characterization of the channel. the time-varying channel impulse response (CIR) is commonly used for this purpose due to its reciprocity and inherent difficulty in being captured by an adversary. While each terminal generates a secret key at its side. based on its own channel measurements combined with an independent noise component. mismatches may occur in the extracted information or in the obtained bit sequences after a sampling and quantization process. To mitigate such bit mismatches. we propose a method that utilizes the properties of the Golay code to correct or detect the bit mismatches for CIR-based secret key agreement.

Data of body weight. empty carcass weight. giblets (liver. gizzard. and heart). neck. breast and femur muscle weights were fitted with age to compared values obtained by applying the Gompertz and logistics. Logistic was the best model in this study to describe growth of quail and Dandarawi chickens. The results indicated that an inverse relationship was found between asymptotic body weight and empty carcass weight with corresponding K value when comparing the species. The same relation was noticed between sexes but with less extend. The exponential growth rate of empty carcass weight was higher than that of body weight. There was also positive relationship in sexes within species between asymptotic weight and age at inflection point. That is mean the heavy body weight of specific sex and empty carcass weight spent more time in the phase of fast growth compared with the sex of lower asymptotic weight. It was found that the larger liver weight. the lower exponential growth rate. Giblets and neck of Japanese quail had higher exponential growth rate compared to Dandarawi chickens. Exponential growth rate of female quail was lower compared to other giblets; this may due to the different type of growth of liver.

1077969,Immunology going wild: genetic variation and immunocompetence in the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos),2019,Elinor Jax,,,,,,The majority of the emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic diseases that can be naturally transmitted between animals and humans. There has been an increase in EIDs worldwide. a trend that is hypothesised to be a result of increased contact between humans and animals due to habitat fragmentation. intensified land use and global warming. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is one example of a well-known viral infection in birds that has recently crossed the species barrier to infect new species of wild and domestic animals. and humans. Yet we know little about the epidemiology of AIV in wild birds. The purpose of this dissertation is to advance our understanding about the immune system in the most important natural host of AIV. the mallard Anas platyrhynchos. To this end I studied immunocompetence in mallards. and assessed genetic variation and evolutionary patterns in the immune system in waterfowl.Throughout my PhD project I made use of massively parallel sequencing technologies called next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS has revolutionised the biological sciences. by allowing for the sequencing of whole genomes and transcriptomes without prior genetic information in the species of interest. This allows for an unbiased study design and the detection of novel genes of importance for the phenomenon of interest.

Investigating molecular virus-host interactions dictating this process and the adaptations to the new hosts that follow is vital to understand zoonotic IAV spread. Receptor incompatibility has been suggested to limit zoonotic IAV transmission from the wild bird reservoir. Other barriers to interspecies transmission. particularly within the avian system. largely remain elusive. Through assessment of infection dynamics of mallard origin IAV in two different avian hosts. coupled with studies of receptor expression and host response we aimed to reveal the host-pathogen interactions in a cross-species transmission event. We found that shedding patterns and innate immune responses were highly dependent on viral genotypes. host species and inoculation routes. but less dependent on receptor expression. Further. in contrary to the prevailing dogma we demonstrate that birds can produce a wide range of different sialylated structures also found in mammals. e.g. extended N- and O-linked  Neu5Ac alpha2.6 terminated glycans. Overall. receptor incompatibility is not the sole transmission barrier for IAV between birds and to humans. but other host-pathogen factors deserve dedicated studies to achieve proper pandemic preparedness.,True,TRPkThsAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.386755v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/11/17/2020.11.17.386755.full.pdf,0,0,0

Novel IAVs have emerged and spread pandemically in the human population. but have over time established endemic circulation with reduced pathogenicity causing seasonal influenza. The natural reservoir of IAVs is wild waterfowl. The past pandemics have been associated with host switch and have partly or entirely originated from birds. or adapted via passage through pigs (postulated IAV mixing vessel). Understanding IAV interspecies transmission mechanisms is essential for pandemic preparedness. Enzootic circulation of avian IAV (AIV) is concentrated to a few waterfowl species. while other bird species seldom are infected. A species barrier preventing IAV interspecies transmission has been suggested. To investigate IAV host range and mixing vessels. histochemistry studies were conducted with tissues from avian species. pigs. and humans. Virus adaptation to new hosts was studied by challenging tufted ducks and chickens with mallard-derived AIVs. together with AIV receptor tropism and glycoproteomic analysis of receptor distribution. Finally. receptor and tissue tropism in ducks was studied systematically for AIV (H1–16).

However. flocks of balanced age and flight experience exhibited reduced leadership stability. indicating that these factors promote flock structuring.

Collective defense is also seen at highly profitable food sources. Aggressive responses are elicited or promoted by several means of communication. e.g. alarm pheromones and other chemical markings. In this study. we demonstrate that the social environment and interactions among colony members (nestmates) modulates the propensity to engage in aggressive behavior and therefore plays an important role in allocating workers to a defense task. We kept Formica rufa workers in groups or isolated for different time spans and then tested their aggressiveness in one-on-one encounters with other ants. In groups of more than 20 workers that are freely interacting. individuals are aggressive in one-on-one encounters with non-nestmates. whereas aggressiveness of isolated workers decreases with increasing isolation time. We conclude that ants foraging collectively and interacting frequently. e.g. along foraging trails and at profitable food sources. remain in a social context and thereby maintain high aggressiveness against potential competitors.

Ants quickly and reliably recognize who belongs to the colony (nestmates) and who is an outsider (non-nestmates) based on chemical recognition cues (cuticular hydrocarbons: CHCs) which as a whole constitute a chemical label. The process of nestmate recognition often is described as matching a neural template with the label. In this study. we tested the prevailing view that ants use commonalities in the colony odor that are present in the CHC profile of all individuals of a colony or whether different CHC profiles are learned independently. We created and manipulated sub-colonies by adding one or two different hydrocarbons that were not present in the original colony odor of our Camponotus floridanus colony and later tested workers of the sub-colonies in one-on-one encounters for aggressive responses. We found that workers adjust their nestmate recognition by learning novel. manipulated CHC profiles. but still accept workers with the previous CHC profile. Workers from a sub-colony with two additional components showed aggression against workers with only one of the two components added to their CHC profile. Thus. additional components as well as the lack of a component can alter a label as 'non-nestmate'. Our results suggest that ants have multiple-templates to recognize nestmates carrying distinct labels. This finding is in contrast to what previously has been proposed. i.e.. a widening of the acceptance range of one template.

Flying insects have thus evolved exceptionally quick visual (1) and olfactory processing ability (2). For example. flighted insects can track the temporal structure of turbulent odor plumes at rates above 100 Hz (3). The evolutionary lability of such sensory systems. however. remains unknown. We test for rapid evolutionary shifts in olfactory processing speed associated with flight loss. through neurobiological comparisons of sympatric flighted versus flightless lineages within a wing-polymorphic stonefly species. Our analyses of sensory responses reveal that recently-evolved flightless lineages have substantially degraded olfactory acuity. By comparing flighted versus flightless ecotypes with similar genetic backgrounds (4). we eliminate other confounding factors that might have affected the evolution of their olfactory reception mechanisms. Our detection of different patterns of degraded olfactory sensitivity and speed in independently wing-reduced lineages highlights parallel evolution of sensory degeneration. These reductions in sensory ability also echo the rapid vestigialization of wings themselves (4. 5). and represent a neurobiological parallel to the convergent phenotypic shifts seen under sharp selective gradients in other systems (e.g. parallel loss of vision in diverse cave fauna (6)). Our study provides the first direct evidence for the hypothesis that flight poses a selective pressure on the speed of olfactory receptor neurons. Our findings also emphasize the energetic costs of rapid olfaction. and the key role of natural selection in shaping dramatic neurobiological shifts.,True,zLtwqfUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035311v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/04/10/2020.04.10.035311.full.pdf,0,0,0
1077980,Chemical cues and how ants use them for recognizing colony members,2018,Stefanie Neupert,,,,,,The most sophisticated form of altruism is found in eusocial insects. with workers usually sacrificing their own reproduction in order to support their mother (queen) in raising offspring (workers. virgin queens and males). Altruistic acts ultimately increase the workers’ indirect fitness. but only when directed towards relatives. Indeed. individuals from the same colony (nestmates) are usually all related and workers rigorously defend their colony against individuals from foreign con-and heterospecific colonies (non-nestmates). Ants are amazingly fast and accurate in discrimination of non-nestmates. however. in rare cases social parasites sneak into and live within a host colony exploiting its resources. Recognition of nestmates and discrimination from non-nestmates is based on mixtures of low-volatile components present on each individuals’ exoskeleton (cuticular hydrocarbons: CHCs). CHC profiles are species-specific and CHC profiles of individuals from neighboring conspecific colonies usually only differ in the quantitative ratios of CHCs. The individuals’ CHC profiles are further influenced by environmental factors and a frequent exchange of CHCs between nestmates results in a uniformation of CHC profiles of nestmates. However. inter-individual. task-specific differences in CHC profiles remain. The neuronal basis of nestmate recognition is unknown. but it is generally assumed that the nestmate recognition process is based on a process of label-template matching where the CHC profile of an encountered ant (label) is compared with a neural representation of the own colony odor (template).

The objective of this work was to investigate the possible protective effects of hesperidin (HDN) (a citrus bioflavonoid) to overcome the deleterious effects of free radicals resulting from exposure to γ- irradiation (IR) and/or paraquat herbicide (PQ). Male albino rats were whole body IR with 6Gy (2 Gy/week). Rats were administered HDN (40mg/Kg bwt) and/or PQ (20.8mg/kg bwt) daily by gavages during the irradiation period (3weeks). The results revealed that exposure to IR and/or PQ induced oxidative stress in blood. lung and dorsal aorta noticed by increased lipid peroxidation marker (malondialdehyde) associated with marked reduction in the content of reduced glutathione. Disturbances in serum lipid and hematology profiles were also recorded. Oxidative stress in lung and dorsal aorta was associated with histological damage. Histological changes in the lung revealed degenerative changes in the bronchiolar epithelium while damaged endothelial cells were observed. Nevertheless damages were more pronounced when rats were exposed to the combined effect of IR and PQ. The administration of HDN to rats has significantly attenuated lipids variation. reduced oxidative stress. improved blood cell counts and attenuated lung and dorsal aorta tissue injury. It could be concluded that HDN might attenuate the severity of IR and/or PQ-induced biochemical. hematological and histological damage mostly attributed to its antioxidant effect.,True,tHZyFlYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,8,http://dspace.must.edu.eg/handle/123456789/567,10974872321986803920,/scholar?cites=10974872321986803920,,http://dspace.must.edu.eg/bitstream/handle/123456789/567/Effect%20of%20Hesperidin%20on%20%CE%B3-Radiation-%20andor%20Paraquat.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The results showed that whole body gamma irradiation (6 Gy) of rats induced mucosal damage. hemorrhage. increased cellularity of the lamina propria layer with areas of complete ulcerations. Histopathological changes were associated with a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs). In parallel. a significant decrease in catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities was demonstrated. Administration of GABA (200 mg/kg body weight GABA daily via gastric gavage for three consecutive weeks) after irradiation of rats has significantly improved the oxidant/antioxidant status which was associated with regeneration of the small intestinal cell structure. Gastric administration of GABA was found to offer an advantageous treatment against gamma irradiation-induced small intestine oxidative stress in rats. probably by utilizing ameliorative effects via its antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate the target-gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. It has been proposed that miRNAs may be crucial to the modulation of the function of semaphorins. Previous findings have proven that miR-497-5p is upregulated and Sema3A is downregulated in some autoimmune disorders. Thus. we aimed to examine the presence of any correlation between Sema3A and miR-497-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).Methods:PBMCs were cultured and transfected with miR-497-5p mimic using the X-tremeGENE™ reagent.

Vitellaria paradoxa. Afin de contribuer à la gestion durable de l'espèce. un inventaire exhaustif des karités a été mené dans des champs et des jachères de différents âges. au moyen d'un dispositif d'échantillonnage imbriqué. En outre. une enquête a été effectuée auprès des propriétaires de différentes parcelles pour mieux cerner les pratiques influençant la dynamique des karités. Les résultats montrent que les densités des karités adultes chutent notablement au sein des champs de plus de quinze ans. À l'inverse. les densités s' accroissent nettement avec l'âge des jachères. Les paysans n'épargnent pas les plantules lors des opérations culturales. ainsi le renouvellement des karités n'est-il guère assuré en champ et la dynamique de l'espèce y est donc régressive. En revanche. une abondante régénération s' installe quand la parcelle est laissée en jachère. Si le contexte écologique le permet. la pratique des longues jachères d'au moins quinze années est une bonne technique pour restaurer les parcs à karités.

To address this task. we designed a methodology of our own. which we call hierarchical aggregation prediction method. The main objective of the proposed method is to achieve a good computational efficiency. without significant loss in accuracy. This is achieved by. reducing the amount of data that is processed through the hierarchical aggregation of data. and application of feature selection methods. We further improve the computational speed of the proposed method by using the relational database for aggregation procedures.

The ultimate goal of this two-year program of work is to refine an energy and climate change taxonomy of terms. develop analytics that are robust in the face of an extensive database. and conduct iterative tests of simple and complex analyses (frequency of mentions over time; connections to social events. social networks and building. and maintenance of online energy related issue communities). The final goal of the program is to make the analytic tools and database available to energy-related scholars as well as others for the advancement of a social movement for environmental sustainability. People influence others and are. in turn. influenced with respect to the actions. brands. products. and issues that they love and hate. This influence promotes awareness. motivates trial behaviors. reinforces purchase decisions. and sustains product or action loyalty. Large-scale social movements such as those for energy efficiency and sustainability require an initial articulate community with a shared belief to create virality. word of mouth. online or in person. is essential to break down barriers. to spread ideas and actions. and to develop innovations. In fact. the ripple effect of word of mouth is estimated to have three times the reach and impact of traditional advertising (Hogan. Lemon. & Libai. 2004). Diffusion of information underpins the success of campaigns to drive change in behavior and the adoption of a sustainable lifestyle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The activity of the free and immobilized enzymes as a function of pH. temperature. storage stability. kinetic parameters and periodic use were compared. The immobilized enzyme showed good storage stability. After repeated use. the alginate beads turned brown and deteriorated. hence the storage stability was not good. The paraffin films were preserved dry because during wet preservation. the film slightly softened and the protein leached out slightly. The alginate beads had moderate mechanical stability. The lac films were tougher than the paraffin wax films in terms of mechanical stability. The Km and Vmax values were altered after immobilization. The Km values for calcium alginate and lac were low. while it was larger in paraffin film as compared to the free enzyme. This may be due to the fact that immobilization on calcium alginate and lac in presence of CaCl2 and methanol exposed certain active sites of the urease.

These were collected from mussels in their natural habitat (N) and from animals maintained in laboratory condition (L) as a novel support. Byssus thread surfaces were characterized by SEM analysis. chemically modified and used for adsorption of urease. The efficiency of the immobilization was calculated by examining the relative enzyme activity of free and the immobilized urease. The pH stabilities of immobilized urease were higher (0.5 unit) than free enzyme. Immobilized enzymes on byssus (both N and L) when stored at 6 °C retained 50% of its activity after 30 days. but they were more stable in dry condition. The optimum temperature of immobilized enzymes was found to increase (25 °C). A Michaelis–Menten constant (K m) value for immobilized urease was also elevated (2.08 mol).,True,9S51pdkAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,9,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12010-011-9376-y,6307790402127586478,/scholar?cites=6307790402127586478,,,0,0,0

This is a rare mollusk as only few splattered colonies are seen. The colony of Mytilus located at Dwarka is very old and consists of very adult animals more than 10-20 years. Also these are located upstream in the mouth of river Gomti. The bed is rocky as well as muddy and estuarine type. whereas the mocha spot is rocky. sandy and purely marine. The animals are located at distance of 10-50 meters from the lowest tide mark. The animals are of different age and size distribution ranging from spat of 1cm size to 10cm largest specimen. Since Dwarka and Mocha are different locations and ecology of both spots being different the animals belonging to same species do differ. But these animals can be maintained under laboratory conditions together as well as separately without showing much difference in their behavior. The animals could survive under laboratory condition for more than 5 months. These animals refused to consume whatever ration were supplied to them and hence they were fed fresh cultured Chetoceros algae as well as amino acid powder. Yeast extracts and other powdery nutrients were rejected vigorously by the animals. The animals under starvation showed severe emaciations and their guts were completely empty and gonad regressed however the byssus productionwas not much hampered as it is crucial for their survival in natural conditions.,True,9S51pdkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,http://www.ijapbc.com/files/10-01-17/05.pdf,,,,http://www.ijapbc.com/files/10-01-17/05.pdf,0,0,0

The animals from Dwarka were ca 10 times more in weight and very old. lack of pollution could be the probable reason for their longitivity. Fe is present in more amounts in the shells of Mytilus from Dwarka. This indicates that Fe is present in large amount in these areas. Dwarka being an ancient city has many remains of iron buried in the coastal areas.

They are often assumed to be microplastics. but include natural as well as synthetic textile fibres and are perhaps best treated as a separate class of pollutants given the challenges they pose in terms of identification and contamination. Microfibres have been largely ignored by traditional methods used to sample floating microplastics at sea. which use 300–500 μm mesh nets that are too coarse to sample most textile fibres. There is thus a need for a consistent set of methods for sampling microfibres in seawater. We processed bulk water samples through 0.7–63 μm filters to collect microfibres in three ocean basins. Fibre density increased as mesh size decreased: 20 μm mesh sampled 41% more fibres than 63 μm. and 0.7 μm filters sampled 44% more fibres than 25 μm mesh. but mesh size (20–63 …,True,dCn-nysAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119332762,15031669177552701733,/scholar?cites=15031669177552701733,,https://www.academia.edu/download/61551026/1-s2.0-S0269749119332762-main20191218-80415-1xl7kku.pdf,0,0,0

Several categories of environmental services provided by forests based on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) include provide clean water. regulate microclimate within the area. habitat for various fauna. as well as recreational areas. In addition to these environmental services. there are many other functions of forest that make forests as an important area to continue to be preserved. Based on the East Java Forestry Official report on 2012. forest area in East Java was about 28% of the total land area. which is below the ideal forest criterion as mandated in Forestry Law No. 41 of 1999 which is told that the ideal forest area is 30% when compared with the land area. Given that the existing forest area in East Java is still below the ideal standard required. conservation efforts must be maximized in addition to rehabilitation efforts against critical areas or vacant lands. It is based on the forest is a source of natural wealth that gives great benefits for human life both ecological. social. cultural and economic. therefore sustainability must be maintained (East Java Forestry Official. 2012).East Java lowland forest have largely shifted their function to both residential and agricultural areas.

Hence. this study aims to assess the effects of maternal Selenium-supplementation at varying stages of periconception period on murine blastocyst morphometric measurements. percent occurrence of good quality blastocysts. and implantation status. ICR female mice were randomly assigned into the unsupplemented group (Group I) receiving basal diet without selenium. and treatment groups given with 3.0 µg selenium supplement per day during pregestation only (Group II). pregestation-throughout-gestation (Group III) and gestation only (Group IV). Both blastocyst morphology and implantation status were assessed. Results show that the morphometric measurements of blastocysts appeared to be unaffected by selenium-supplementation at different periconception stages. Seleniumsupplementation at pregestation only (Group II) and gestation only (Group IV) produced higher percent occurrence of good quality blastocysts and lower percent pre-implantation loss relative to Group III. Among treatment groups. selenium-supplementation during pregestation-to-gestation (Group III) yielded low quality blastocysts and high percent pre-implantation loss. In conclusion. maternal Selenium-supplementation during pregestation only and gestation only are the best stages to yield high percent occurrence of good quality blastocysts and pre-implantation success.,True,sacnRZ8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/pdf/conferences/research-congress-proceedings/2016/GRC/GRC-FNH-I-003.pdf,,,,https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/wp-content/uploads/pdf/conferences/research-congress-proceedings/2016/GRC/GRC-FNH-I-003.pdf,0,0,0

For many insects. reproductive success in patchily-distributed species can be improved by sibling-mating. In many cases. such strategies correspond to sexual dimorphism. with males–whose reproductive activities can take place without dispersal–investing less energy in development of dispersive resources such as large body size and wings. This dimorphism is particularly likely when males have little or no chance of mating outside their place of birth. such as when sperm competition precludes successful fertilisation in females that have already mated. The economically important bark beetle pest species Dendroctonus micans (Coleoptera: Curculionidae.

Hosts face trade-offs in the allocation of resources in growth and reproduction or in defense. and the defense/resources status varies with time after host’s death or weakening event. Tree-killing bark beetles at endemic levels must choose along a spectrum. compromising between encountering minimal defense and facing high competition. or benefiting from high nutritional quality but facing high host defense.The relationships between resources and defenses in dead/dying trees have not been quantitatively assessed to date. because most studies focus on epidemic conditions.

Dendroctonus micans …,2017,Loïc Dohet and Jean-Claude Grégoire,43,Journal of Chemical Ecology,8,778-793,Springer US,Examples of totally specific predators are rare. and the mechanisms underlying this specificity are often poorly understood. In Eurasia. the Monotomid beetle Rhizophagus grandis is found only in the galleries of its prey. the bark beetle Dendroctonus micans. The specificity of R. grandis relies on kairomones which female predators use to adjust their oviposition to the number of prey larvae available in a gallery. Yet these chemical signals are still largely unknown. The North American D. punctatus and D. valens. which are not sympatric with R. grandis but have a similar ecology as D. micans. could also elicit predator oviposition. which would suggest that specificity in this predator-prey system is constrained by geography. In order to further identify these determinants of specificity. we used artificial oviposition boxes to compare the oviposition level of R. grandis in the presence of larvae of each of the three …,True,ellrUqIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-017-0869-1,3048222992960929090,/scholar?cites=3048222992960929090,,,0,0,0

1078102,Creativity for learning biology in higher education,2013,Diki Diki,,,,,,Learning biology is considered difficult. especially in some areas like cell division. genetics. and hormones (Cimer. 2012). On the other hand. there is a connection between student success in learning science with creativity (Son. 2009). As creativity can be defined as the formation of new and useful ways to solve a problem (Sternberg & Kaufmann. 2010). it can be used to help students to learn biology. Meanwhile. according to Guilford (1950). creativity includes divergent and convergent thinking. Research on creativity in learning biology helps to integrate different research findings. formulating ideas. and analogies (Dunbarr. 1997). Analogy is a process to explain a difficult topic. by referring to other more familiar topics. While integrating different research findings is important. students usually cannot find any relations among different topics. Formulating ideas is used to support students’ skills in developing a hypothesis and a resulting conclusion. Although the benefit of creativity in science education is critical. the research on this field is still lacking. The research in creativity to support learning biology may help to improve learning result. as well as prepare students for their future career. Biology is a subject that is difficult to learn. The difficulty affects student achievement.

Recent CT screening trials demonstrated a stage-shift towards earlier stage lung cancer and reduction of mortality (~ 20%). However. a sizable fraction of patients (30–50%) with early stage disease still experience relapse and an adverse prognosis. Thus. the identification of effective prognostic biomarkers in stage I lung cancer is nowadays paramount. Here. we applied a multi-tiered approach relying on coupled RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data analysis of a large cohort of lung cancer patients (TCGA-LUAD. n= 510). which enabled us to identify prognostic miRNA signatures in stage I lung adenocarcinoma. Such signatures showed high accuracy (AUC ranging between 0.79 and 0.85) in scoring aggressive disease. Importantly. using a network-based approach we rewired miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks. identifying a minimal signature of 7 miRNAs. which was validated in a cohort of FFPE lung adenocarcinoma samples (CSS. n= 44) and controls a variety of genes overlapping with cancer relevant pathways. Our results further demonstrate the reliability of miRNA-based biomarkers for lung cancer prognostication and make a step forward to the application of miRNA biomarkers in the clinical routine.

Using this signature. we developed a blood test (miR-test) which was capable of detecting asymptomatic lung cancer in a large cohort (N>1000) of high-risk individuals (>50years and smokers). Interestingly. we now found that a fraction (~30%) of these cf-miRNAs were preferentially expressed in cells of epithelial origin. while another ~30% were more expressed in hematopoietic cells. We reasoned that this cf-miRNA signature could result from the extracellular release of miRNAs from cancer epithelial cells as well as from immune/stromal cells composing the tumor microenvironment. We developed an integrated strategy for the identification of the origin of cf-miRNAs through combined analysis of published circulating and intracellular miRNAs expression datasets …,True,p15HabIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/13_Supplement/4441.short,,,,,0,0,0

University of Basrah,Background: Using density functional theory (DFT) investigations. we investigate graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) as a new nanobiosensor for amino acids detection in fish products. The adsorption features of three classes (lysine. methionine. and threonine) of amino acids close to GNFs-surface are considered and investigated by using Gaussian software. The geometric properties. energetic properties. global reactivity descriptors. and electrostatic potential counter map have been considered to see the order of the adsorption strength in the systems and good understanding of nature of the interactions in amino acids/GNFs process. Methodology: The computational model of GNFs consists of 24 carbon atoms with 12 hydrogen atoms in ends. The GNF is a nanostructure with high aspect ratio. and the greater area of contact. which can enhance the chemical reactivity of biomolecules. The non-covalent interaction of amino acids with the GNFs would change the electrical conductance of GNFs-based sensors by charge transfer between GNFs and amino acid adsorbed through the local chemical reactivity and cause efficient detection of a variety of biomolecules and more development in biomedical applications. Results: The results show that GNFs with large adsorption energy and significant charge transfer through the adsorption of amino acid can exploit as a nanobiosensor. The developing field for applications of nanobiosensors was for the reason that same length order of magnitude scales of several of the fundamental building blocks of life with the nanoscale material.

Recent observations suggest that the centrosome acts as a scaffold for proteasomal degradation in the cell to regulate a variety of biological processes including cell fate acquisition. cell cycle control. stress response. and cell morphogenesis. Here. we review the body of studies indicating a role for the centrosome in promoting proteasomal degradation of ubiquitin-proteasome substrates and explore the functional relevance of this system in different biological contexts. We discuss a potential role for the centrosome in coordinating local degradation of proteasomal substrates. allowing cells to achieve stringent spatiotemporal control over various signaling processes.,True,HxP4z20MbrEC:u-x6o8ySG0sC,20,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15384101.2016.1196306,4139127300472296754,/scholar?cites=4139127300472296754,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15384101.2016.1196306,0,0,0

Wnt-dependent ACDs rely on nuclear asymmetry of the transcriptional coactivator SYS-1/β-catenin between daughter cells to differentially activate Wnt-responsive target genes. Here. we investigate how dynamic localization of SYS-1 to mitotic centrosomes influences SYS-1 inheritance in daughter cells and cell-fate outcomes after ACD. Through yeast two-hybrid screening. we identify the centrosomal protein RSA-2 as a SYS-1 binding partner and show that localization of SYS-1 to mitotic centrosomes is dependent on RSA-2. Uncoupling SYS-1 from the centrosome by RSA-2 depletion increases SYS-1 inheritance after ACD and promotes Wnt-dependent cell fate.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling initiates transcriptional reprogramming upon stabilization of the transcription factor β-catenin. which is otherwise posttranslationally processed by a destruction complex and degraded by the proteasome. Since various Wnt signaling components are enriched at centrosomes. we examined the functional contribution of centrosomes to Wnt signaling. β-catenin regulation. and posttranslational modifications. In HEK293 cells depleted of centrosomes we find that β-catenin synthesis and degradation rates are unaffected but that the normal accumulation of β-catenin in response to Wnt signaling is attenuated. This is due to accumulation of a novel high-molecular-weight form of phosphorylated β-catenin that is constitutively degraded in the absence of Wnt.

1078156,Centrosome-associated regulation of proteasomal degradation and Wnt/β-Catenin signaling,2017,Setu M Vora,,,,,University of Iowa,The last half-century of inquiry into the cell has seen the identification of a multitude of signaling pathways critical to cell function as well as the detailed mapping of its internal organization. Despite these critical advances. little is known about how the intracellular arrangement of signaling components allows them to dynamically execute pathway functions. Centrosomes are non-membrane bound organelles that serve as the major microtubule organizing centers in the cell. but recent evidence has also indicated a function in harboring important signaling events. particularly those that rely on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is responsible for key developmental processes including asymmetric cell division and cell fate specification in C. elegans. It is shown that C. elegans SYS-1/β-catenin is subject to a centrosome-associated degradation mechanism to synchronize its degradation with asymmetric division. effectively limiting its retention by daughter cells to allow robust cell fate decisions. Centrosome-associated degradation is demonstrated to operate as a substrate-specific regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells under normal physiological conditions. Finally. the centrosome is identified as a key regulator of β-catenin post-translational processing and Wnt response in mammalian cells. raising the possibility of an entirely novel mechanism of signal pathway regulation by centrosomes.,True,HxP4z20MbrEC:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://ir.uiowa.edu/etd/5872/,,,,https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7350&context=etd,0,0,0

IDPs are a class of proteins that. despite the absence of a defined tertiary structure. are able to perform a biological function and play an important role in a large number of pathologies. In this thesis I have studied one of the most important proteins involved in neurodegenerative disease worldwide. α-synuclein (α-syn). which is related to Parkinson’s diseases. This protein is prone to originate amyloids fibrils as a result of β aggregation processes. which start from the monomeric state and end with the production of amyloid fibrils in Lewy’s bodies. the main hallmarks of this dementia [1].The goal of my PhD project is to describe the early stages of the aggregation kinetics of α-syn in order to understand the mechanisms at the origin of the pathological process. The novel method discussed in this thesis is based on the combination of computational techniques and experimental measurements that I performed at ESRF. the European Synchrotron (Grenoble). on diluted water solutions of IDPs. Disordered structures. originating from molecular dynamics simulation or related techniques [2]. are taken into account by estimating the relative population weights from sets of experimental SAXS data in the framework to the Bayesian formalism.

Genetic signals of adaptation and reproductive isolation are often confounded by a wide range of factors. such as variation in demographic history or genomic features. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the Loch Maree catchment. Scotland. exhibit reproductively isolated divergent life history morphs. including a rare piscivorous (ferox) life history form displaying larger body size. greater longevity and delayed maturation compared to sympatric benthivorous brown trout. Using a dataset of 16.066 SNPs. we analyzed the evolutionary history and genetic architecture underlying this divergence. We found that ferox trout and benthivorous brown trout most likely evolved after recent secondary contact of two distinct glacial lineages. and identified 33 genomic outlier windows across the genome. of which several have most likely formed through selection. We further identified twelve candidate genes and biological pathways related to growth. development and immune response potentially underpinning the observed phenotypic differences. The identification of clear genomic signals divergent between life history phenotypes and potentially linked to reproductive isolation. through size assortative mating. as well as the identification of the underlying demographic history. highlights the power of genomic studies of young species pairs for understanding the factors shaping genetic differentiation.

The drivers & consequences of alternative life history strategies in S. trutta,2017,Martin Robert Hughes,,,,,,Understanding the mechanisms involved in producing and maintaining variation in phenotype. behaviour and life history traits within a single species. is of fundamental importance to evolutionary biology. Such intraspecific variation is well observed in organisms inhabiting depauperate environments. exploiting uncontested trophic niches. Classic examples can be found in island communities such as Darwin’s Finches of the Galapagos Islands and the Anolis lizards of the Caribbean. where organisms derived from a single invading ancestor rapidly diversified into numerous ecologically distinct niches. forming distinct and often reproductively isolated populations. Such adaptive radiations are considered an essential prerequisite to species formation and is often referred to as ecological speciation.Freshwater lakes share characteristics similar to islands that enable ecological speciation to occur rapidly. The rapid proliferation of African cichlids species in the African Great lakes is perhaps the best example of ecological speciation found on Earth today. Thousands of species of African cichlids have been described within Lakes Malawi. Tanganyika and Victoria each adapted. often morphologically. to a particular ecological niche. Fish species inhabiting post-glacial lakes of the Northern hemisphere represent model organisms to study the early mechanism of ecological speciation. Species such as Arctic charr and Three-spine sticklebacks have diverged across ecological axes within a single lake in numerous systems.

It recognizes unique molecular structures of antigens that are called antigenic determinants or epitopes. Each mIg is associated with an Igα/Igβ (CD79a/CD79b) heterodimer that functions as the signaling subunit of the BCR. Signals initiated by the BCR play an essential role in B cell development. selection. survival. and activation. At the same time. a key function of the BCR is to internalize bound antigen and deliver it to antigen processing/MHC II (major histocompatibility complex class II)-loading compartments such that B cells can present antigen to T cells and elicit T cell help. a critical second signal for B cell activation.

B cells are often activated by antigens that are displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Binding of membrane-associated antigens to the B cell receptor (BCR) causes rapid cytoskeleton-dependent changes in the spatial organization of the BCR and other B cell membrane proteins. leading to the formation of an immune synapse. This process has been modeled using antigens attached to artificial planar lipid bilayers or to plasma membrane sheets. As a more physiological system for studying B cell-APC interactions. we have expressed model antigens in easily transfected adherent cell lines such as Cos-7 cells. The model antigens that we have used are a transmembrane form of a single-chain anti-Igκ antibody and a transmembrane form of hen egg lysozyme that is fused to a fluorescent protein. This has allowed us to study multiple aspects of B cell immune synapse formation …,True,mw90Zk4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,4,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-7474-0_10,17432250086811922472,/scholar?cites=17432250086811922472,,http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/76652/1/Chaohong%20Liu_2018.pdf#page=137,0,0,0

The role of Rap2 proteins in establishing cell polarity is not well understood. We now show that depleting Rap2c. the only Rap2 isoform expressed in the A20 B-cell line. impairs BCR-induced MTOC reorientation as well as the actin remodeling that supports MTOC polarization.

Ants are a functionally important and diverse group of insects in these ecosystems. It is largely unknown how local patterns of species diversity and composition are determined through the interaction of this dominant animal group with abiotic features of longleaf pine ecosystems. Here we describe how an important abiotic variable. depth to water table. relates to ant species distributions at local scales. Pitfall trapping studies across habitat gradients in the Florida coastal plains longleaf pine flatwoods showed that the ant community changed with mild differences in habitat. In this undulating landscape. elevation differences were less than 2 m. and the depth to the water table ranged from < 20 cm to 1.2 m.

Green tea (GT) has been shown to have potential beneficial effects on different types of cancer. The aim of this review was to evaluate the association between GT regular consumption and risk of BC in women. The risk of BC recurrence and risk of BC in relation to menopausal status were also evaluated. A literature search of PubMed. Scopus. and Web of Science was conducted. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to perform the systematic review and meta-analysis. Full texts were downloaded for 40 studies; however. only 13 records were included in the meta-analysis. Eight were cohort studies and five were case-control studies. The pooled sample consisted of 163.810 people. An inverse statistically significant relationship between GT and BC risk. with an Odds Ratio (OR)= 0.85 ((95% CI= 0.80–0.92). p= 0.000)). was found. Egger’s linear regression test did not show a potential publication bias (intercept 0.33. t= 0.40. p= 0.695). which was also confirmed by the symmetry of the funnel plot. Moreover. no high statistical heterogeneity (Chi 2= 31.55. df= 13. I 2= 58.79%. p= 0.003) was found.

Tunnel construction workers are exposed to complex mixtures of toxic agents. some of which are known to be genotoxic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic risk in this occupational setting by comparing tunnel workers with a control group for frequencies of nuclear aberrations in oral exfoliated cells.Methods. To evaluate the genotoxic effects of tunnel air pollutants. we conducted a cross-sectional. molecular epidemiological study (35 tunnel workers and 35 healthy controls) using the buccal micronucleus cytome assay. A questionnaire was administered to obtain information about demographic variables. lifestyle. dietary habits. anthropometric data. and occupational history. Buccal mucosa cells were collected by scraping the buccal mucosa with a small-headed toothbrush. Coded slides were examined blind by trained scorers for micronuclei (MN). nuclear buds (NBUD). and other nuclear abnormalities. Results. Road tunnel construction workers revealed higher frequencies of cells with genotoxic damage (ie. MN and NBUD).

In this context. primary DNA damage was assessed in buccal lymphocytes (BLs). fresh whole venous. and capillary blood leukocytes. and compared with that in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs)—the most frequently used cells—in 15 young subjects. Mouthwashes were collected after the volunteers rinsed their mouths with normal saline. and BLs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. Blood samples were collected by venipuncture or by lancet. Anthropometric and lifestyle information was obtained by the administration of a structured questionnaire. As shown in the Bland-Altman plots. the level of agreement between BLs and PBLs lied within the accepted range. we thus enrolled a wider population (n= 54) to assess baseline DNA damage in BLs. In these cells. mean values of tail length (µm). tail intensity (%). and tail moment were 25.7±0.9. 6.7±0.4 and 1.0±0.1. respectively. No significant association was observed between sex and smoking habit with any of the DNA damage parameters. Conversely. underweight subjects displayed significantly higher genomic instability compared with normal weight group (p< 0.05).

While most geckos are nocturnal. the species in the Cnemaspis genus are mostly diurnal (only a few are nocturnal). This raises a question about the evolution of a diel niche in the Cnemaspis genus. Cnemaspis geckos are distributed across Southeast Asia and are often sympatric with Cyrtodactylus. another widespread gecko genus in the same area. Since both genera are mainly rocky habitat specialists. we hypothesize that Cyrtodactylus may influence the temporal activity pattern of Cnemaspis when they are sympatric through competition. By analyzing habitat data. diel activity. and the existence of sympatric Cyrtodactylus species across the phylogeny of the Cnemaspis genus. we found (1) strong phylogenetic signals in the habitat use trait but not in temporal activity. suggesting that the diel niche of this genus is …,True,584HfZYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,5,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56549-x,15274557396791312695,/scholar?cites=15274557396791312695,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56549-x,0,0,0

Monica,The significant reduction in precipitation caused by global warming has led to a marked increase in the concentration of salts in the soil. thus causing the plants to tolerate a much higher salinity. The response of plants to salinity consists of numerous processes that must work together to alleviate both cellular hyperosmolarity and ionic imbalance. Salinity tolerance and plant growth stability are complex genetic traits that are difficult to establish in crops. as saline stress can occur as a catastrophic episode or be imposed continuously or intermittently. and can gradually become more severe at any stage of plant development. Given these conditions. we aimed to identify the influence of saline stress on the germination process of cucumber seeds. To perform the experiment. saline solutions were prepared in different concentrations: 0.25 mM and 0.12 mM. over which sea buckthorn extract (5 ml/l) was added. 18 repetitions were performed. 3 for each solution. Our results indicated that salt stress significantly reduced the cucumber seedlings shoots and roots growth. Also. the cucumber seeds germination was significantly inhibited at concentrations of 0.12 and 0.25 mM of NaCl solution supplemented with sea buckthorn extract.,True,DH-1FWIAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC,0,https://natsci.upit.ro/media/2051/004din-et-al.pdf,,,,https://natsci.upit.ro/media/2051/004din-et-al.pdf,0,0,0

No matter the reason for the missing values in the data. coherent and complete data matrix is always a pre-requisite for accurate and reliable statistical analysis. Therefore. there is a need for proper imputation strategies that account for the missingness and reduce the bias in the statistical analysis. Here we present our results after evaluating nine imputation methods in four different percentages of missing values of different origin. The performance of each imputation method was analyzed by Normalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE). We demonstrated that random forest (RF) had the lowest NRMSE in the estimation of missing values for Missing at Random (MAR) and Missing Completely at Random (MCAR). In case of absent values due to Missing Not at Random (MNAR). the left truncated data was best imputed with minimum value imputation. We also tested the different imputation methods for datasets containing missing data of various origin. and RF was the most accurate method in all cases. The results were obtained by repeating the evaluation process 100 times with the use of metabolomics datasets where the missing values were introduced to represent absent data of different origin.

Such knowledge is limited for the Santander Poison Frog (Andinobates virolinensis). a threatened frog endemic to the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes. Here. we use new and historical data to model the potential distribution of this species and estimate its extent of occurrence. Our model predicted that suitable habitat exists on the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental in Santander. Boyacá. and Cundinamarca departments in Colombia. The occurrence of this species was strongly. positively associated with precipitation of the driest month. and positively. but more weakly related to mean diurnal temperature range and isothermality. Our models suggest the low elevations of the Chicamocha and Sogamoso canyons and the high elevations of the Cordillera Oriental constitute unsuitable habitats for this species. We identified 10.828 km2 of suitable habitat. of which about 3.5% is inside protected areas. Our findings suggest that A. virolinensis should be re-categorized from Endangered to Vulnerable in the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Amphibians may be susceptible to habitat alterations because of their sensitivity to microclimate changes. limited dispersal capacities. and high susceptibility to desiccation (Nowakowski et al. 2013; Robinson et al. 2013; Mendenhall et al. 2014). Previous studies at tropical latitudes have shown that human habitat disturbance generates changes in the structure and composition of amphibian ensembles. promotes the spread of generalists and alien species. and probably leads to local extinctions of species (Urbina-Cardona et al. 2006; Isaacs and Urbina-Cardona 2011; Cortés-Gómez et al. 2013). Given the unprecedented rate of habitat loss in many tropical regions. scientists have focused on assessing the potential of human-altered landscapes. such as agroecosystems. as an alternative approach to biodiversity conservation (Schroth et al. 2004; Somarriba et al. 2004). Shaded coffee plantations resemble forest-like habitats in terms of vegetation structure and density. including several levels of vertical stratification of arboreal elements and a complex canopy that modulate the microclimates of the coffee understory. which are likely to be critical to maintain levels of biodiversity comparable with those found in adjacent native forests (Perfecto et al. 1996; Moguel and Toledo 1999; Somarriba et al. 2004; Philpott et al. 2008; Urrutia-Escobar and Armbrecht 2013).

1078278,Remyelination of Demyelinated Rat Spinal Cord Model by Transplanting Neural Stem Cells,2012,Samane Adib and Taghi Tirahi and Taher Taheri,15,Pathobiology Research,2,23-34,,Objective: Demyelination of CNS axons occurs under pathological conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries. but can be repaired by cell therapy. Within the CNS remyelination can be achieved by transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs are self-renewing cells that maintain the capacity to differentiate into CNS-specific cell types and can differentiate into the three main neural phenotypes: astroglia. oligodendroglia and neurons. They may also replace or repair diseased CNS tissue. Methods: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were aseptically isolated from the tibia and femurs of young adult Sprague Dawley rats. BMSCs were evaluated by fibronectin and CD31 markers. BMSC-derived NSCs were evaluated by nestin and NF-68. An ethidium bromide-induced demyelinated dorsal column lesion was produced in young adult rats. Transplanting NSCs derived-BMSCs into demyelinated lesions after 3 days in adult rat spinal cords was done. Three weeks after transplantation of NSCs. the spinal cords were processed to evaluate remyelination by Luxol fast blue staining. Results: After passage 3. BMSCs were evaluated and the result. showed the percentage of immunoreactive cells to fibronectin (94.7±2.65). however BMSC-derived NSCs expressed nestin (86.15±0.64) and NF-68 (84.55±0.94) which correlated with fibronectin down regulation. Histologically. the lesions showed slightly irregular elongated areas and had an average length of 1336.36±39.43 µm. Transplanted NSCs were capable of eliciting remyelination.

J,,1-8,,This study was carried out on 100 thymus gland of apparent healthy Tilapia Nilotica fish. The thymus was situated on the superior edge of the gill cover close to the opercular cavity; the thymus was surrounded by connective tissue capsule which consisted of collagen fibers and reticular fibers. The thymocytes (T-lymphocytes) form the main type of cells which were embedded within a network of epithelial reticular cells. The thymus was characterized by presence of Hassall’s body-like structures. myoid cells. mucin secreting cells and melanomacrophage cells. The thymus showed great involution in winter in the form of decreased number of lymphocytes. proliferation of connective tissue and adipose tissue. Regeneration of thymic tissue was noticed during spring. Sharp increase in lymphocytes was observed during summer as the lymphocytic foci became denser and increased in size. In autumn the parenchyma was divided into corticomedullary like zones showing increased connective tissue proliferation especially in the medulla.

Anat.,2,13-26,,The morphology of the goat aqueous outflow system and the iridocorneal anglewas studied in fifteen normal eyes from adult apparently healthy goats using light and scanning electron microscopy. The iridocorneal angle of the goat includes the pectinate ligament. the ciliary cleft. the trabecular meshwork (uveal and corneoscleral) and the angular aqueous plexus. The iridocorneal angle of the eye of goat was large; its length measured 1.3- 1.7 mm and its width measured 1.0- 1.2 mm anteriorly and 0.20-0.27 mm posteriorly. The pectinate liga- mentwas a strong. band-like structure extending from the iridal base to the limbic zone. Its length varied from 500-700 μm and its thickness was 120-150 μm. There were spac- es and pores between its strands. The ciliary cleft contained a large amount of trabecular tissue that could be divided into two distinct parts: the uveal meshwork and the corneoscleral meshwork.

Generally. the vesicular gland of bucks was compact and lobulated gland.It was covered by a muscular capsule sending fibro-muscular septa dividing the gland into irregular unequal lobules. Eachlobule was formed of numerous secretory acini and few amount of inter-acinar connective tissue stroma. Each lobule hada central collecting sinus to collect the secretions from the different acini. Both secretory acini and central collectingsinuses were lined mainly with pseudostratified columnar epithelium that was consisted mainly of secretory columnarcells and few small basal cells. The secretion was released into the acinar limen via apocrine mode. The castrated bucksshowed more connective tissue and less acinar components in comparison to non-castrated bucks.

Anat.,2,,,Comparative anatomical studies were made measuring several morphological characteristics seen in cross-sections of the optic nerve of one-humped camel (Camelus dro- medarius) and donkey (Equus asi- nus). Six optic nerves from each animal were used in this study. The optic nerve samples were obtained about 5mm behind the eye. The axon numbers and diameters were studied with light and transmission electron microscopes. Axon diameters were measured in samples of 500 axons taken from several loca- tions in a cross section of the optic nerve behind the eye. The total cross-sectional area of the optic nerve was about 35% smaller in the donkey than in the camel. The fibers are organized in fascicles. The fiber density and number was 2.3 times higher in the camel than in the donkey. The total number of optic nerve fibers counted was 1173323 ± 33039 in camels and 495754 ± 10126 in donkeys. The majority of axons were myelinated in the optic nerve of both animals. There was a significant regional variation in the size of optic nerve axons.

1078295,Regional biodiversity of terrestrial Heteroptera and Orthoptera in southwestern Illinois,2015,Sam W Heads and Steve Taylor and Daniel R Swanson and Michael J Thomas,,,,,Illinois Natural History Survey,We conducted a baseline inventory of terrestrial Heteroptera (true bugs) and Orthoptera (grasshoppers. crickets and katydids) at four sites in Monroe and Randolph counties. Illinois in 2014. namely: Mill Creek Natural Area (MCNA); White Rock Nature Preserve(WRNP); Fogelpole Cave Nature Preserve (FCNP); and Kidd Lake State Natural Area(KLSNA). A total of 95 species in the focal taxa were recorded(67 Heteroptera and 28 Orthoptera). In addition. a further 96 species of arthropods in groups other than Heteroptera and Orthoptera were also recorded. Heteropteran diversity was found to be typical of that expected for other natural areas in Illinois. though orthopteran diversity was much lower and may be related to structural aspects of the respective habitats. Cluster analysis of our presence/absence data revealed marked differences in site similarity between orthopteran and heteropteran species assemblages.Cover photo: Dark (top) and pale(bottom) color forms of the female admirable grasshopper.
