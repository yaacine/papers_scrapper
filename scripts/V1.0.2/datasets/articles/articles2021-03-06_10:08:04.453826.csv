It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time. and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology. we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes. change over spatial scales and through time.

Quantifying and predicting its effectiveness at large spatial scales is critical for increased sustainability of agricultural production. Landscape complexity is known to benefit natural enemies. but its effects on interactions between natural enemies and the consequences for crop damage and yield are unclear.

A major cause of unreliable models is excessive model complexity. and regularization methods aim to improve the predictive performance by adequately constraining model complexity.

Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement. and led to the emergence of the new field of ‘movement ecology’. Here. we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research. i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales. from genes to ecosystems. and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals. and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First. organismal movements can provide ‘mobile links’ between habitats or ecosystems. thereby connecting resources. genes. and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology. because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e.. foraging. dispersal. migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second. organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities. through ‘equalizing’ and ‘stabilizing’ mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales.

Still. there is a widespread lack of information about the spatial distribution of individual species and biodiversity as a whole. Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring and especially the combination of LiDAR and hyperspectral data is expected to deliver valuable information. In this study spatial patterns of vascular plant community composition and α-diversity of a temperate montane forest in Germany were analysed for different forest strata. The predictive power of LiDAR (LiD) and hyperspectral (MNF) datasets alone and combined (MNF+ LiD) was compared using random forest regression in a ten-fold cross-validation scheme that included feature selection and model tuning. The final models were used for spatial predictions. Species richness could be predicted with varying accuracy (R 2= 0.26 to 0.55) depending on the forest layer. In contrast. community composition of the different layers. obtained by multivariate ordination. could in part be modelled with high accuracies for the first ordination axis (R 2= 0.39 to 0.78). but poor accuracies for the second axis (R 2≤ 0.3). LiDAR variables were the best predictors for total species richness across all forest layers (R 2 LiD= 0.3. R 2 MNF= 0.08. R 2 MNF+ LiD= 0.2). while for community composition across all forest layers both hyperspectral and LiDAR predictors achieved similar performances (R 2 LiD= 0.75. R 2 MNF= 0.76. R 2 MNF+ LiD= 0.78).

Rapid large-scale assessment of vegetation structure allows bridging the requirements of habitat selection studies on grain size and extent. particularly in forest habitats. For roe deer. the cold period in winter forces individuals to optimize their trade off in searching for food and shelter. We analyzed the winter habitat selection of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in a montane forest landscape combining estimates of vegetation cover in three different height strata. derived from high resolution airborne Laser-scanning (LiDAR. Light detection and ranging). and activity data from GPS telemetry. Specifically. we tested the influence of temperature. snow height. and wind speed on site selection. differentiating between active and resting animals using mixed-effects conditional logistic regression models in a case-control design. Site selection was best explained by temperature deviations from hourly means. snow height. and activity status of the animals. Roe deer tended to use forests of high canopy cover more frequently with decreasing temperature. and when snow height exceeded 0.6 m. Active animals preferred lower canopy cover. but higher understory cover.

The idea behind applying tradable permits to conservation is that developers wishing to turn land to economic purposes. thereby destroying valuable habitat. may only do so if they submit a permit to the conservation agency showing that habitat of at least the equivalent ecological value is restored elsewhere. The developer himself does not need to carry out the restoration. but may buy a permit from a third party. thus allowing a market to emerge. Nevertheless. the application of tradable permits to biodiversity conservation is a complex issue because destroyed and restored habitats are likely to differ.

1155908,Does proactive biodiversity conservation save costs?,2011,Martin Drechsler and Florian V Eppink and Frank Wätzold,20,Biodiversity and Conservation,5,1045-1055,Springer Netherlands,Ecologists usually argue for a proactive approach to species conservation—it should start before a species is endangered and under substantial risk of extinction. In reality. however. conservation often only starts when species populations are already in a critical state. This may be the result of a policy process in which those actors who see only little or no benefits from conserving species try to delay conservation as long as possible to avoid its cost. A frequent consequence is that populations decline to critical levels so that once conservation policies set in due to legal obligations. political pressure or any other reason. additional conservation measures are required to re-establish the populations. We show that the costs associated with this policy process may be higher than those of a proactive policy.

For this purpose a spatial allocation model for two different regions is developed which allows guidelines to be derived on how to achieve the highest possible ecological benefit within a given budget provided to support biodiversity-enhancing forms of land use. In contrast to other conservation biological models. our model includes more realistic economic assumptions. The difference from economic models dealing with the efficient spatial allocation of environmental goods is that the benefit function of our model is based on ecological theory.

To address the dynamic dimension of the problem we consider tradable development rights as the instrument of choice. A particular challenge in applying tradable development rights is that the conservation benefit of an individual habitat patch depends on its spatial relationship with other habitat patches and thus is an emergent rather than a fixed property. We analyse with a conceptual model the spatial and temporal dynamics of habitats in a region under a tradable development rights market that takes spatial interaction of habitats explicitly into account. In our analysis two different outcomes may emerge depending on the levels of spatial interaction and cost heterogeneity: an “ordered” structure where habitat patches are clustered in space and are stable over time. and a …,True,4hjtCVUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,65,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090800342X,16878227414069466524,/scholar?cites=16878227414069466524,,,0,0,0

Economists can contribute to an answer by estimating the ‘optimal level of species conservation’. This requires an assessment of the supply and the demand curve for conservation and a comparison of the two curves to identify the optimal conservation level. In a case study we estimated the optimal conservation level of Large Blue butterflies (protected by the EU Habitats Directive) in the region of Landau. Germany.

Knowledge on tree species is relevant for biomass estimation. habitat quality assessment. and biodiversity characterization. Hyperspectral data have been proven to have a high potential for the mapping of tree species composition.

Modelling soil moisture dynamics therefore requires an interdisciplinary approach that links hydrological. atmospheric and biological processes. Previous approaches treat either root water uptake rates or root distributions and transpiration rates as given. and calculate the soil moisture dynamics based on the theory of flow in unsaturated media. The present study introduces a different approach to linking soil water and vegetation dynamics. based on vegetation optimality. Assuming that plants have evolved mechanisms that minimise costs related to the maintenance of the root system while meeting their demand for water. we develop a model that dynamically adjusts the vertical root distribution in the soil profile to meet this objective. The model was used to compute the soil moisture dynamics. root water uptake and fine root respiration in a tropical savanna over 12 months. and the results were compared with observations at the site and with a model based on a fixed root distribution. The optimality-based model reproduced the main features of the observations such as a shift of roots from the shallow soil in the wet season to the deeper soil in the dry season and substantial root water uptake during the dry season. At the same time. simulated fine root respiration rates never exceeded the upper envelope determined by the observed soil respiration. The model based on a fixed root distribution. in contrast. failed to explain the magnitude of water use during parts of the dry season and largely over-estimated root respiration rates …,True,JpPT2RYAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,125,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/12/913/2008/,16587500758895177030,/scholar?cites=16587500758895177030,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/12/913/2008/hess-12-913-2008.pdf,0,0,0

A shaded leaf. for example. may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds. due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments. (2 to 60 minutes). the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations. the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid over-heating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought.

Transfer in space is difficult because the models are conditioned on past observations at particular places to define parameter values and unobservable processes that are needed to fully characterize the structure and functioning of the landscape. Transfer in time has to deal with the likely temporal changes to both parameters and processes under future changed conditions. This remains an important obstacle to addressing some of the most urgent prediction questions in hydrology. such as prediction in ungauged basins and prediction under global change. In this paper. we propose a new approach to catchment hydrological modeling. based on universal principles that do not change in time and that remain valid across many places. The key to this framework. which we call behavioral modeling. is to assume that there are universal and time-invariant organizing principles that can be used to identify the most appropriate model structure (including parameter values) and responses for a given ecosystem at a given moment in time. These organizing principles may be derived from fundamental physical or biological laws. or from empirical laws that have been demonstrated to be time-invariant and to hold at many places and scales. Much fundamental research remains to be undertaken to help discover these organizing principles on the basis of exploration of observed patterns of landscape structure and hydrological behavior and their interpretation as legacy effects of past co-evolution of climate. soils …,True,JpPT2RYAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,82,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/635/2011/,11776823597691293341,/scholar?cites=11776823597691293341,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/15/635/2011/hess-15-635-2011.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we propose that a combination of the concept of hydrological response units (HRUs) and thermodynamics offers several helpful and partly novel perspectives for gaining this improved understanding. Our key idea is to define functional similarity based on similarity of the terrestrial controls of gradients and resistance terms controlling the land surface energy balance. rainfall runoff transformation. and groundwater storage and release. This might imply that functional similarity with respect to these specific forms of water release emerges at different scales. namely the small field scale. the hillslope. and the catchment scale. We thus propose three different types of ""functional units"" – specialized HRUs. so to speak – which behave similarly with respect to one specific form of water release and with a characteristic extent equal to one of those three scale levels.

The basic mechanical model considers cavity expansion into a plastic wet soil involving wedging by root tips or earthworms via cone-like penetration followed by cavity expansion due to pressurized earthworm hydroskeleton or root radial growth. The mechanical stresses and resulting soil strains determine the mechanical energy required for bioturbation under different soil hydro-mechanical conditions for a realistic range of root/earthworm geometries. Modeling results suggest that higher soil water content and reduced clay content reduce the strain energy required for soil penetration. The critical earthworm or root pressure increases with increased diameter of root or earthworm. however. results are insensitive to the cone apex (shape of the tip). The invested mechanical energy per unit length increase with increasing earthworm and plant root diameters. whereas mechanical energy per unit of displaced soil volume decreases with larger diameters. The study provides a quantitative framework for estimating energy requirements for soil penetration work done by earthworms and plant roots. and delineates intrinsic and external mechanical limits for bioturbation processes. Estimated energy requirements for earthworm biopore networks are linked to consumption of soil organic matter and suggest that earthworm populations are likely to consume a significant fraction of ecosystem net primary production to sustain their subterranean activities.,True,JpPT2RYAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,49,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128914,8726758803220224151,/scholar?cites=8726758803220224151,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128914,0,0,0
1155966,Quantifying the thermodynamic entropy budget of the land surface: Is this useful?,2011,Nathaniel Allan Brunsell and Stanislaus J Schymanski and Axel Kleidon,2,Earth System Dynamics,1,87-103,Copernicus GmbH, As a system is moved away from a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. spatial and temporal heterogeneity is induced. A possible methodology to assess these impacts is to examine the thermodynamic entropy budget and assess the role of entropy production and transfer between the surface and the atmosphere. Here. we adopted this thermodynamic framework to examine the implications of changing vegetation fractional cover on land surface energy exchange processes using the NOAH land surface model and eddy covariance observations. Simulations that varied the relative fraction of vegetation were used to calculate the resultant entropy budget as a function of fraction of vegetation. Results showed that increasing vegetation fraction increases entropy production by the land surface while decreasing the overall entropy budget (the rate of change in entropy at the surface). This is accomplished largely via simultaneous increase in the entropy production associated with the absorption of solar radiation and a decline in the Bowen ratio (ratio of sensible to latent heat flux). which leads to increasing the entropy export associated with the latent heat flux during the daylight hours and dominated by entropy transfer associated with sensible heat and soil heat fluxes during the nighttime hours. Eddy covariance observations also show that the entropy production has a consistent sensitivity to land cover. while the overall entropy budget appears most related to the net radiation at the surface. however with a large variance. This implies that quantifying the thermodynamic entropy budget and entropy production is a useful metric for assessing biosphere …,True,JpPT2RYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,45,https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/2/87/2011/,915177520674390345,/scholar?cites=915177520674390345,,https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/2/87/2011/esd-2-87-2011.pdf,0,0,0

However. evidence suggests that increasing wind speed enhances carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake while reducing transpiration because of more efficient convective cooling (under high solar radiation loads). We provide theoretical and experimental evidence that leaf water use efficiency (WUE. carbon uptake per water transpired) commonly increases with increasing wind speed. thus improving plants' ability to conserve water during photosynthesis. Our leaf‐scale analysis suggests that the observed global decrease in near‐surface wind speeds could have reduced WUE at a magnitude similar to the increase in WUE attributed to global rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

The formation of patterns permits the maintenance of larger overall biomass at low rainfall rates compared with homogeneous vegetation.

One appealing prospect to fill this modelling gap is the hypothesis that plants regulate gsw optimally. that is. they vary gsw so that carbon gain is maximized for a given water loss (Cowan & Farquhar. 1977). Challenges arise when using this hypothesis to predict stomatal behaviour. particularly in relation to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (ca). One challenge is that the optimal short-term response of gsw to ca is widely perceived to differ from the observed response (Katul et al.. 2010; Medlyn et al.. 2011. 2013).

Savannas are open-canopy environments that encompass a broad demographic continuum. often characterised by a changing dominance between C 3-tree and C 4-grass vegetation. where frequent environmental disturbances such as fire modulates the balance between ephemeral and perennial life forms. Climate change is projected to result in significant changes to the savanna floristic structure. with increases to woody biomass expected through CO 2 fertilisation in mesic savannas and increased tree mortality expected through increased rainfall interannual variability in xeric savannas. The complex interaction between vegetation and climate that occurs in savannas has traditionally challenged terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). which aim to simulate the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface to predict responses of vegetation to changing in environmental forcing. In this review. we examine whether TBMs are able to adequately represent savanna fluxes and what implications potential deficiencies may have for climate change projection scenarios that rely on these models. We start by highlighting the defining characteristic traits and behaviours of savannas. how these differ across continents and how this information is (or is not) represented in the structural framework of many TBMs. We highlight three dynamic processes that we believe directly affect the water use and productivity of the savanna system: phenology …,True,JpPT2RYAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,31,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/14/4711/2017/,15942984264293991372,/scholar?cites=15942984264293991372,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/14/4711/2017/bg-14-4711-2017.pdf,0,0,0

We hypothesize that daily variations in transpiration are dominated by variations in atmospheric demand. while site-specific controls. including limiting soil moisture. act on longer timescales. We test these hypotheses with data of a measurement setup consisting of five sites along a valley cross section in Luxembourg. Both hillslopes are covered by forest dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Two independent measurements are used to estimate stand transpiration:(i) sap flow and (ii) diurnal variations in soil moisture. which were used to estimate the daily root water uptake. Atmospheric evaporative demand is estimated through thermodynamically constrained evaporation. which only requires absorbed solar radiation and temperature as input data without any empirical parameters. Both transpiration estimates are strongly correlated to atmospheric demand at the daily timescale. We find that neither vapor pressure deficit nor wind speed add to the explained variance. supporting the idea that they are dependent variables on land–atmosphere exchange and the surface energy budget. Estimated stand transpiration was in a similar range at the north-facing and the south-facing hillslopes despite the different aspect and the largely different stand composition.

Amphistomaty occurs predominantly in fast‐growing herbaceous annuals and in slow‐growing perennial shrubs and trees.

First. there is no evidence that amphistomatous species achieve higher stomatal densities on a projected leaf area basis than hypostomatous species. but two‐sided gas exchange is less limited by boundary layer effects.

It has been widely evaluated at the canopy scale. where aerodynamic and canopy resistance to water vapour are difficult to estimate directly. leading to various empirical corrections when scaling from leaf to canopy. Here. we evaluated the PM equation directly at the leaf scale. using a detailed leaf energy balance model and direct measurements in a controlled. insulated wind tunnel using artificial leaves with fixed and predefined stomatal conductance. Experimental results were consistent with a detailed leaf energy balance model; however. the results revealed systematic deviations from PM-predicted fluxes. which pointed to fundamental problems with the PM equation. Detailed analysis of the derivation by Monteith(1965) and subsequent amendments revealed two errors: one in neglecting two-sided exchange of sensible heat by a planar leaf. and the other related to the representation of hypostomatous leaves. which are very common in temperate climates. The omission of two-sided sensible heat flux led to bias in simulated latent heat flux by the PM equation. which was as high as 50 % of the observed flux in some experiments. Furthermore. we found that the neglect of feedbacks between leaf temperature and radiative energy exchange can lead to additional bias in both latent and sensible heat fluxes.

Hence. the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is used here to describe them mathematically. This means flows of water are written as functions of gradients in the gravitational and chemical potential of water between two parts of the hydrological system. Such a framework facilitates a consistent thermodynamic representation of the hydrological processes in the model. Furthermore. it allows for the calculation of the entropy production associated with a flow of water. which is proportional to the product of gradient and flow. Thus. an entropy budget of the hydrological cycle at the land surface is quantified. illustrating the contribution of different processes to the overall entropy production. Moreover. the proposed Principle of Maximum Entropy Production (MEP) can be applied to the model. This means. unknown parameters can be determined by setting them to values which lead to a maximisation of the entropy production in the model. The model used in this study is parametrised according to MEP and evaluated by means of several observational datasets describing terrestrial fluxes of water and carbon.

Yet our present view is biased towards arctic and temperate/tropical forest regions. with very little focus on the extensive arid regions of the planet. The Australian arid zone is one of the largest desert landform systems in the world. with a unique. diverse and relatively well-studied biota. With foci on palaeoenvironmental and molecular data. we here review what is known about the assembly and maintenance of this biome in the context of its physical history. and in comparison with other mesic biomes. Aridification of Australia began in the Mid-Miocene. around 15 million years. but fully arid landforms in central Australia appeared much later. around 1–4 million years. Dated molecular phylogenies of diverse taxa show the deepest divergences of arid-adapted taxa from the Mid-Miocene. consistent with the onset of desiccation. There is evidence of arid-adapted taxa evolving from mesicadapted ancestors. and also of speciation within the arid zone. There is no evidence for an increase in speciation rate during the Pleistocene. and most arid-zone species lineages date to the Pliocene or earlier. The last 0.8 million years have seen major fluctuations of the arid zone. with large areas covered by mobile sand dunes during glacial maxima. Some large. vagile taxa show patterns of recent expansion and migration throughout the arid zone. in parallel with the ice sheet-imposed range shifts in Northern Hemisphere taxa.

Quantitative descriptions of the environmental variables with which organisms are associated are becoming common with the advent of geographic information systems (GIS). Although such descriptive approaches to the niche are useful for interpolating species distributions. they implicitly incorporate biotic interactions and therefore do not represent the fundamental niche. A mechanistic understanding of the fundamental niche. when combined with GIS data. can provide us with greater insight into the causes of distribution and abundance. a solid foundation for exploring the role of biotic interactions. and greater confidence in extrapolating to novel circumstances such as climate change and species introductions.

Here I suggest interrelated working definitions of these terms whereby the concept of habitat remains associated with descriptive/correlative analyses of the environments of organisms. while the niche concept is reserved for mechanistic analyses.

The transition from sex to parthenogenesis is frequently associated with a major change in geographical distribution. often biasing parthenogenetic lineages towards environments that were severely affected by the glacial cycles of the Late Pleistocene. It is difficult to interpret these patterns as arising simply as a result of selection for the demographic effects of parthenogenesis because many parthenogenetic organisms are also hybrids. Here. I argue that many cases of geographical parthenogenesis might be best seen as part of a broader pattern of hybrid advantage in new and open environments.

1156003,Why does phenology drive species distribution?,2010,Isabelle Chuine,365,,1555,3149-3160,The Royal Society,Despite the numerous studies which have been conducted during the past decade on species ranges and their relationship to the environment. our understanding of how environmental conditions shape species distribution is still far from complete. Yet. some process-based species distribution models have been able to simulate plants and insects distribution at a global scale. These models strongly rely on the completion of the annual cycle of the species and therefore on their accomplished phenology. In particular. they have shown that the northern limit of species' ranges appears to be caused mainly by the inability to undergo full fruit maturation. while the southern limit appears to be caused by the inability to flower or unfold leaves owing to a lack of chilling temperatures that are necessary to break bud dormancy.

Since the early 1970s. efforts have concentrated on predicting phenology of the temperate and boreal forests because they represent one-third of the carbon captured in plant ecosystems and they are the principal ecosystems with seasonal patterns of growth on Earth (one-fifth of the plant ecosystems area). Numerous phenological models have been developed to predict the growth timing of temperate or boreal trees. They are in general empirical. nonlinear and non-nested. For these reasons they are particularly difficult to fit. to test and to compare with each other.

Phenological models that simulate the start of the growing season should be efficient tools to predict vegetation responses to climatic changes and related changes in energy balance. Species‐specific phenological models developed in the eighties have not been used for global‐scale predictions because their predictions were inaccurate in external conditions.

Some argue it was a result of indigenous groups adopting domesticates and cultigens via trade and exchange. Others contend it was the consequence of a migration of farmers from mainland Europe. To shed light on this debate. we used radiocarbon dates to estimate changes in population density between 8000 and 4000 cal BP. We found evidence for a marked and rapid increase in population density coincident with the appearance of cultigens around 6000 cal BP.

Here we compare the largest analysis of European cemeteries to date with an independent line of evidence. the summed calibrated date probability distribution of radiocarbon dates (SCDPD) from archaeological sites. Our cemetery reanalysis confirms increased growth rates after the introduction of agriculture; the radiocarbon analysis also shows this pattern. and a significant correlation between both lines of evidence confirms the demographic validity of SCDPDs. We analyze the areal extent of Neolithic enclosures and demographic data from ethnographically known farming and foraging societies and we estimate differences in population levels at individual sites. We find little effect on the overall shape and precision of the SCDPD and we observe a small increase in the correlation with the cemetery trends. The SCDPD analysis supports the hypothesis that the transition to agriculture dramatically increased demographic growth. but it was followed within centuries by a general pattern of collapse even after accounting for higher settlement densities during the Neolithic.

In this paper. we show that a) on theoretical and empirical grounds human populations cannot be assumed to be stable over long time periods. and that b) radiocarbon dates can be used to track past population fluctuations in time and in relation to changes in climate. We present here a case study of such processes from the Mesolithic of the British Isles. with a particular focus on Ireland. A series of analyses demonstrate the pronounced spatio-temporal fluctuations in human activity on a population scale throughout the Mesolithic. Whilst taphonomic and research bias concerns have to be taken into consideration. demographic contexts bear critically on our reconstructions of. and explanations for. past material culture change.

Previous approaches that propose functional-adaptive technological trajectories are critiqued. Different theoretical approaches towards technology and associated units of analysis are examined. Behavioural ecology. evolutionary archaeology. and dual inheritance theory are shown to hold most promise for explaining trait-lineages in a given technological tradition. Previous approaches to bow-arrow technology are analysed. and an evolutionary archaeological methodology appropriate for examining lithic armatures is presented. Environment. historical contingency. selection. drift. population dynamics and social learning mechanisms are seen as key complex factors requiring case by case examination. An evolutionary case study with nine temporally. geographically. and culturally related stratigraphic phases containing a total of 3600 complete lithic armatures from the south Scandinavian middle Mesolithic (c. 6600-5400 BC) is presented. The phases are described in terms of associated fine-grained archaeological data and previous interpretations.

Therefore the southern Caucasus provides an opportunity to examine Neanderthal behavioral patterns within an environmental and geographical cul de sac. Unfortunately. our current understanding of Middle Palaeolithic settlement and subsistence patterns within this region suffers from a dearth of well-excavated. dated. and documented sites. Previous excavations at the rockshelter Ortvale Klde. Djruchula Cave. and Bronze Cave. located in the western Georgian Republic. hint at a variable system of settlement and subsistence linked closely to prevailing environmental and topographical conditions. Although mountainous. warm. humid. and well forested. the numerous deep river valleys that drain the Caucasus form a patchwork of ecological niches populated by a wide array of floral and faunal species. The discontinuous nature of environmental communities and the natural impediments to mobility presented by deep valleys. fast rivers. and high elevations. likely influenced the settlement and subsistence behaviors of Neanderthals more than the cultural factors often cited.

A series of taphonomic tests and analyses are employed to reconstruct the depositional history of the bone assemblage and investigate LMP (Neanderthal) and EUP (Modern human) hunting and subsistence strategies. We identify the maximum number of skeletal elements. document bone surface modifications. the mode of bone fragmentation. and the demographic structure of the main hunted ungulate population. The assemblage is characterized by significant densitymediated biases. yet in situ attrition and carnivore damage play a minimal role in assemblage formation.

The region occupies an intermediate position between Europe and Asia that is bounded to the west. north. and east by the Black Sea. the Caucasus Mountains. and the Caspian Sea. respectively. As such it represents a geographic cul de sac where individuals and cultures in contact have limited room to maneuver as they compete for space and resources. In such settings. where movements and opportunities are largely circumscribed by the surrounding landscape. it is uncommon for significant spatial or temporal overlap to occur among populations competing to occupy the same niche. especially if one population possesses or develops a major technological. biological. demographic. or social advantage. This chapter considers recent archaeological data from Ortvale Klde. a late Middle-early Upper Palaeolithic rockshelter in western Georgia. which indicate that the Neanderthal occupation of the region came to an abrupt end approximately 36 ka (uncal BP). The Upper Palaeolithic populations who replaced them can be distinguished by their new technologies of bone and stone but not by their hunting behaviors. which are indistinguishable from those of the Neanderthals. It is argued that developments in the social rather than the technological realm of Upper Palaeolithic societies allowed these populations to rapidly replace Neanderthals in the Caucasus. with little if any significant temporal overlap or interaction.,True,sgvFGngAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,36,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=482375471521281421&hl=en&oi=scholarr,482375471521281421,/scholar?cites=482375471521281421,,,0,0,0

Temperature records derived from central Greenland ice cores show one significant temperature anomaly between 8.200 and 8.100 years ago. which is often attributed to a meltwater outflow into the North Atlantic Ocean and a slowdown of North Atlantic Deep Water formation—this anomaly provides an opportunity to study such processes with relevance to present-day freshening of the North Atlantic.

This reduction of excess evaporation would have been imposed by intensifications of (1) the Indian Ocean summer (SW) monsoon. influencing the eastern Mediterranean via increased Nile discharge. and (2) the system of Mediterranean depressions (an element of the westerly Atlantic system) causing increased precipitation and decreased evaporation. Both the Indian Ocean summer monsoon. and the westerly Atlantic system. would be intensified in response to the occurrence of distinct minima in the cycle of precession.It is demonstrated that reduced excess evaporation. whether or not coinciding with global phases of …,True,utLu03QAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,474,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002532279490202X,17337467774592408007,/scholar?cites=17337467774592408007,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46240265/0025-3227_2894_2990202-x20160604-13686-ummhlg.pdf,0,0,0

It is suggested that the absence of neogloboquadrinids in the Holocene sapropel and their abundance in older sapropels reflect differences in food availability related to the extent of development of a deep chlorophyll maximum layer (DCM) and the intensity of “new” primary production associated with this layer. The depth of such a layer. which consists of phytoplankton with a characteristic taxonomic composition. is determined by the vertical hydrodynamical structure.

1156094,The eastern Mediterranean climate at times of sapropel formation: a review,2007,EJ Rohling and FJ Hilgen,,,Classic Papers,,Igitur,Sapropel formation in the eastern Mediterranean coincided closely with minima in the precession index. Such minima occur approximately every 21000 years. At such times perihelion falls within Northern Hemisphere summer. Minima in the precession index are characterized by intensified Indian Ocean (summer) SW monsoonal circulation. which enhanced discharge of the river Nile into the eastern Mediterranean. However. by compiling paleoclimatological data from the literature. the influence of the monsoon is shown to have reached only as far as the southern Sinai Desert. Therefore. it does not account for contemporary humid phases in the northern borderlands of the eastern Mediterranean. which seem to have been characterized mainly by increased summer precipitation. We argue that increased (summer) precipitation along the northern borderlands of the eastern Mediterranean. at times of sapropel formation. was probably due to increased activity of Mediterranean (summer) depressions. Forming predominantly in the western Mediterranean and tracking eastwards. such depressions tend to lower the excess of evaporation from the eastern Mediterranean relative to that from the western basin. Picking up additional moisture along their eastward path. such depressions also redistribute freshwater within the complex eastern Mediterranean water balance. The increase in runoff and the related flux of nutrients and continental organic matter that resulted from the increased precipitation on the northern borderlands of the eastern Mediterranean. at times of sapropel formation. presumably provided a substantial addition to that which entered …,True,utLu03QAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,306,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/28551,9301894635760910345,/scholar?cites=9301894635760910345,,https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/28551/article.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

We deduce that the aeolian hematite in eastern Mediterranean sediments derives from the eastern Algerian. Libyan. and western Egyptian lowlands located north of the central Saharan watershed (∼21°N).

We find that most of the major taxa show a clear W to E shallowing of their upper or lower depth limit. coinciding with a W to E decrease in the surface water primary production. and in the estimated flux of the labile organic matter to the sea floor. This observation implies that the bathymetrical succession of these taxa is indeed determined by the organic flux. In the western Mediterranean. we find successions from more oligotrophic taxa at greater water depths to more eutrophic taxa in more shallow water.

It is widely held that obsidian sourcing can offer little new information during a period in which there is a variety of artifacts and texts available to study. Obsidian. though. is unparalleled in its widespread use and ability to be sourced. so it provides unique information about contact. exchange. and migration. Its sourcing can complement other types of information and be used to test existing hypotheses.

It is now more straightforward to analyze a “museum quality” tool on display in a gallery than the flaking chips and resharpening debitage recovered with it.

The records of U. kioviensis nutlets are the first subfossil finds reported and prove the indigenous status of this taxon in north-eastern Germany.

This has evoked the question if the fire regime during the Allerød and Younger Dryas was driven exclusively by natural agents (temperature. precipitation. vegetation pattern) or was–at least to some extent–a result of anthropogenic burning. We contribute to this question by examining on-site and off-site archives in the Jeetzel valley at the Late Palaeolithic site Grabow 15 (N-Germany). The spatial analysis of the charcoal distribution and biomarkers (“black carbon”) in an on-site test area enabled a detailed reconstruction of human burning activities during the early Allerød. A determination of the charred wood taxa allowed a reconstruction of the local vegetation pattern during the time of human occupation. The evidence of man-made fire was compared to the general occurrence of charcoal particles in two palaeochannels that provided archives for palynological and sedimentological analysis for the time span from the Allerød to the early Holocene. Based on the reconstructed local vegetation patterns. human occupation phases and water levels we conclude that human presence during the early Allerød must have increased the input of charcoal and biomarkers into the local sediments. During the Younger Dryas no human contribution to the local charcoal influx was detected. We concluded that future studies must considerate the very local impact of man-made fires in much greater detail.,True,jbflF1sAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,13,https://www.academia.edu/download/33646773/2014_Tolksdorf_ZfG.pdf,12326042912418896997,/scholar?cites=12326042912418896997,,https://www.academia.edu/download/33646773/2014_Tolksdorf_ZfG.pdf,0,0,0

The area in which the site is located. known as The Pellenz. has been marked since the beginning of this century by the commercial extraction for the building industry of pumices and ashes deposited during the Quaternary period. The small-scale stripping of these tephra deposits. particularly pumice deposited during the eruption of the Laacher volcano which took place between 13.050 and 13.190 cal BP (Baales.

Basierend auf dieser geprüften 14C-Datenbank wird eine chronologische Differenzierung bekräftigt. denn die Daten von Fundplätzen der klassischen Hamburger Kultur sind regelhaft älter als ca. 12 300 BP14C (die Schreibweise BP14C wird im folgenden für unkalibrierte Radiokarbon-Daten verwendet. um Missverständnissen vorzubeugen. die durch unterschiedliche Konventionen entstehen könnten). Die der Havelte Gruppe zugeordneten Datierungen sind fast alle jünger als dieses Datum. Die Übergangsperiode zwischen beiden Gruppen kann in den frühesten Abschnitt des spätglazialen Interstadials gestellt werden und ist möglicherweise mit der Ausbreitung einer dichteren Strauch-Vegetation verbunden. Gleichzeitig spiegeln die radiokarbon-datierten Fundstellen annährend die geographische Verteilung insbesondere der Havelte Gruppe wider. die im Osten der nordeuropäischen Tiefebene bisher nicht vertreten ist.

When examining the archaeological implications of human adaptation to the subsequent changes in the natural environment two divergent biotic regions are of special interest: the North European Plain and adjacent areas; and the Alpine foothills and surrounding mountain ranges. In these regions. two different archaeological technocomplexes (traditions) are found: the Tanged Point Complex and the Curve-Backed Point Groups. Considering the distribution of the archaeological sites witnessing changes in the material culture and subsistence pattern. the intensity of the environmental changes caused by the Younger Dryas is a decisive element.

In this context. Resilience Theory (RT) has become a potent tool to study socio-ecological systems and. thus. meet these public demands. RT facilitates how to conceptualise the interweaving of behavioural adaptations (e.g.. mobility. economy. and social systems) with their external environmental setting. The Adaptive Cycle Model has emerged as a (if not the) key approach in using RT in empirical case studies and its application covers today the entire spatial and temporal field of prehistoric archaeology. However. several challenges remain for research in the future that are summarized in this paper. in particular the lack of a coherent terminology as well as the challenging task of defining the parameters of connectedness and …,True,erLIFK8AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,47,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216307959,2672844066455579729,/scholar?cites=2672844066455579729,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52168273/Bradtmoeller_et_al_2017_Resilience_theory_in_archaeological_practice.pdf,0,0,0

1156163,Dating the Hamburgian in the context of Lateglacial Chronology,2007,MARA-JULIA Weber and SONJA B Grimm,,"Chronology and Evolution within the Mesolithic of North-West Europe: Proceedings of an International Meeting, Brussels, May 30th-June 1st 2007",,3-21,,During the last 75 years the advances of dating methods in archaeology are reflected in the development of the Hamburgian chronology. The Hamburgian was first defined as an archaeological culture from a purely typological standpoint. and was subsequently placed by later research in a stratigraphically and palynologically well determined time frame. The interval. which is covered by the Hamburgian. is associated with the period of climate change from the late Weichselian to the early Lateglacial Interstadial. Accordingly the makers of the Hamburgian were the first to recolonise the North European Plain after the Last Glacial Maximum. But even though Hamburgian assemblages were also among the first ever 14C dated archaeological inventories. reliable dates are rare. Especially for the inner chronology of the Hamburgian a lack of dates for the later (Havelte) group often seems to be caused by the poor preservation of organic material. Therefore other dating methods (like stratigraphy) are still indispensable for understanding the chronology of the Lateglacial expansion onto the North European Plain. Based on the contemporarily available evidences of typology. stratigraphy. pollen analysis. geographic distribution and reliable 14C dates. an origin of the Hamburgian in the East German and Polish late Magdalenian appears most plausible.,True,erLIFK8AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,15,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=V1HsDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:ygM5Fg2VWiMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=X4uo4mZ8ry&sig=cWB7dM7BgHgBvSLzwDUH869FvsI,2547512422671385546,/scholar?cites=2547512422671385546,,,0,0,0

Despite this. a human presence during this time period is evident at several locations across the region. including in Switzerland. less than 50 km from the Alpine ice sheet margin. It has been hypothesised that such human activity may have been restricted to brief periods of climatic warming within the LGM. but chronological information from many of these sites are currently too poorly resolved to corroborate this. Here we present a revised chronology of LGM human occupation in Switzerland. AMS radiocarbon dating of cut-marked reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) bones from the sites of Kastelhöhle-Nord and Y-Höhle indicates human occupation of Switzerland was most likely restricted to between 23.400 and 22.800 cal.

The commonality among these approaches is their consideration of only spatial effects of the first order (ie. the interaction of the locations with the site characteristics). Second-order effects (ie. the interaction of locations with each other) are rarely considered. We introduce a deductive approach to investigating such second-order effects using linguistic hypotheses about settling behavior in the Final Palaeolithic. A Poisson process was used to simulate a point distribution using expert knowledge of two distinct hunter–gatherer groups. namely. reindeer hunters and elk hunters. The modeled points and point densities were compared with the actual finds. The G-. F-. and K-function. which allow for the identification of second-order effects of varying intensity for different periods. were applied. The results reveal differences between the two investigated groups. with the reindeer hunters showing location-related interaction patterns. indicating a spatial memory of the preferred locations over an extended period of time. Overall. this paper shows that second-order effects occur in the geographical modeling of archaeological finds and should be taken into account by using approaches such as the one presented in this paper.

The twofold aim of the workshop was:(1) to provide an overview of approaches and methods that are presently used to incorporate paleoenvironmental information in human–environment interaction modeling applications. and building thereon;(2) to devise new approaches and solutions that might be used to enhance the reconstruction of past human–environmental interconnections. This report first outlines the presented papers. and then provides a joint protocol of the often extensive discussions that came up following the presentations or else during the refreshment intervals. It concludes by adressing the open points to be resolved in future research avenues. eg. implementation of open science practices. new procedures for reviewing of publications. and future concepts for quality assurance of the often complex paleoenvironmental data. This report may serve as an overview of the state of the art in paleoenvironment mapping and modeling.

1156203,A novel approach for independent budgeting of fossil fuel CO2 over Europe by 14CO2 observations,2003,Ingeborg Levin and Bernd Kromer and Martina Schmidt and Hartmut Sartorius,30,Geophysical Research Letters,23,,,Long‐term atmospheric 14CO2 observations are used to quantify fossil fuel‐derived CO2 concentrations at a regional polluted site. and at a continental mountain station in southwest Germany. Fossil fuel CO2 emission rates for the relevant catchment areas are obtained by applying the Radon‐Tracer‐Method. They compare well with statistical emissions inventories but reveal a larger seasonality than earlier assumed. thus contributing significantly to the observed CO2 seasonal cycle over Europe. Based on the present approach. emissions reductions on the order of 5–10% are detectable for catchment areas of several hundred kilometres radius. as anticipated within a five‐years commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

RA-Hox1 in the epidermal ectoderm is necessary for formation of the atrial siphon placode (ASP). a structure homologous to the vertebrate otic placode. Loss of Hox1 function resulted in loss of the ASP. which could be rescued by expressing Hox1 in the epidermis.

OIMA1 is a skeletal muscle actin gene expressed in somitic muscle and head muscle and OIMA2 is probably a cardiac muscle actin gene expressed in both somitic and cardiac muscle. The differential transcription mechanisms for these two genes were examined in embryos by introducing fusion genes in which the OIMA1 or OIMA2 upstream region was connected to the green fluorescent protein gene. Embryos were injected with these fusion genes at the 2-cell stage. A fusion gene containing the region up to-949 of OIMA1 exhibited strong expression in somitic muscle. The coexistence of two regions.-949/-662 and-421/-201. is necessary for skeletal muscle-specific expression of OIMA1. Two E boxes and other unidentified sequences cooperatively function to achieve the full activity of the enhancer-949/-662. As for OIMA2. the region up to-520 is sufficient for strong muscle-specific expression. The region between-520 and-174 of OIMA2 is necessary for specific expression in both skeletal and cardiac muscles. In addition to the CArG box located at-140. an E-box at-430 is important for the expression in cardiac muscle as well as skeletal muscle. When the enhancers for the two muscle actin genes were switched and combined with each other's promoter. they were able to upregulate tissue-specific expression according to their origin.

In the ascidian Ciona. nuclear accumulation of β-catenin is the first step in the process of endoderm specification. We show that nuclear accumulation of β-catenin directly activates the gene (Cs-FoxD) for a winged helix/forkhead transcription factor and that this gene is expressed transiently at the 16- and 32-cell stages in endodermal cells. The function of Cs-FoxD. however. is not associated with differentiation of the endoderm itself but is essential for notochord differentiation or induction. In addition. it is likely that the inductive signal that appears to act downstream of Cs-FoxD does not act over a long range.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,We have developed an expert system that makes use of various kinds of knowledge organized as “if‐then” rules for predicting protein localization sites in Gram‐negative bacteria. given the amino acid sequence information alone. We considered four localization sites: the cytoplasm. the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane. the periplasm. and the outer membrane. Most rules were derived from experimental observations. For example. the rule to recognize an inner membrane protein is the presence of either a hydrophobic stretch in the predicted mature protein or an uncleavable N‐terminal signal sequence. Lipoproteins are first recognized by a consensus pattern and then assumed present at either the inner or outer membrane. These two possibilities are further discriminated by examining an acidic residue in the mature N‐terminal portion.

Here we showed that Treg cell development was achieved by the combination of two independent processes. i.e.. the expression of Foxp3 and the establishment of Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation pattern. Both events were induced by T cell receptor stimulation. The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp3+ T cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression. lineage stability. and full suppressive activity.

To find the function of these genes. the homology search technique has been routinely used. However. there always remains a significant fraction of genes (open reading frames.

Transcription starts as the RNA polymerase binds to the promoter and continues until it reaches a transcriptional terminator. Some terminators rely on the presence of the Rho protein. whereas others function independently of Rho. Such Rho-independent terminators consist of an inverted repeat followed by a stretch of thymine residues. allowing us to predict their presence directly from the DNA sequence. Unlike in Escherichia coli. the Rho protein is dispensable in Bacillus subtilis. suggesting a limited role for Rho-dependent termination in this organism and possibly in other Firmicutes. We analyzed 463 experimentally known terminating sequences in B. subtilis and found a decision rule to distinguish Rho-independent transcriptional terminators from non-terminating sequences. The decision rule allowed us to find the boundaries of operons in B. subtilis with a sensitivity and specificity of about 94%. Using the same decision rule. we found an average sensitivity of 94% for 57 bacteria belonging to the Firmicutes phylum. and a considerably lower sensitivity for other bacteria. Our analysis shows that Rho-independent termination is dominant for Firmicutes in general. and that the properties of the transcriptional terminators are conserved. Terminator prediction can be used to reliably predict the operon structure in these organisms. even in the absence of experimentally known operons.

Here we identify a behavioral shift and its morphological basis in Astyanax mexicanus. a teleost with a sighted surface-dwelling form (surface fish) and various blind cave-dwelling forms (cavefish) [2. 3. 4]. Vibration attraction behavior (VAB) is the ability of fish to swim toward the source of a water disturbance in darkness. VAB was typically seen in cavefish. rarely in surface fish. and was advantageous for feeding success in the dark.

Astyanax mexicanus,2002,Thomas E Dowling and David P Martasian and William R Jeffery,19,Molecular biology and evolution,4,446-455,Oxford University Press,A diverse group of animals has adapted to caves and lost their eyes and pigmentation. but little is known about how these animals and their striking phenotypes have evolved. The teleost Astyanax mexicanus consists of an eyed epigean form (surface fish) and at least 29 different populations of eyeless hypogean forms (cavefish). Current alternative hypotheses suggest that adaptation to cave environments may have occurred either once or multiple times during the evolutionary history of this species. If the latter is true. the unique phenotypes of different cave-dwelling populations may result from convergence of form. and different genetic changes and developmental processes may have similar morphological consequences.

Here we consider recent studies on the development of the tadpole larva that provide new insights into chordate origins and evolution. The notochord of ascidian larvae and vertebrates appear to be homologous structures based on their induction by endoderm and expression of the Brachyury (T) gene. The muscle cells of ascidian larvae also appear homologous to those of vertebrates based on their expression of bHLH myogenic and muscle-type actin genes. although they are specified by cytoplasmic determinants localized in the egg as well as embryonic induction. Studies of the tailless larvae of anural ascidians have resulted in the identification of Manx. a gene that may control tail development and evolution.

In cavefish embryos. eye primordia degenerate under the influence of hyperactive Shh signaling. In concert. cavefish show amplified jaw size and taste bud numbers as part of a change in feeding behavior. To determine whether pleiotropic effects of hyperactive Shh signaling link these regressive and constructive traits. shh expression was compared during late development of the surface-dwelling (surface fish) and cave-dwelling (cavefish) forms of Astyanax.

More recently. several different adaptive hypotheses have been proposed to explain eye degeneration based on studies in the teleost Astyanax mexicanus. which consists of blind cave-dwelling (cavefish) and sighted surface-dwelling (surface fish) forms. One of these hypotheses is that eye regression is the result of indirect selection for constructive characters that are negatively linked to eye development through the pleiotropic effects of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling.

A Wiley Company,Ascidians have evolved alternate modes of development in which the conventional tadpole larva is remodeled or eliminated. Adultation. the precocious development of adult features in the larval head. is caused by superimposing the larval and adult differentiation programs. Caudalization. the addition of muscle cells to the larval tail. is caused by enhancing muscle induction or increasing the number of muscle cell divisions before terminal differentiation. Adultation and caudalization are correlated with increased egg size. suggesting dependence on maternal processes. Anural development. the elimination of the larval stage. is caused by maternal and zygotic events resulting in abbreviation and deletion of larval developmental programs.

The addition of 1 nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT). at which the proliferation of the cells was most stimulated. did not change the level of AR mRNA but increased the level of AR protein by reducing the turnover rate of the AR protein. EGF also stimulated the proliferation of the cells but repressed the expression of AR mRNA and protein. This repression was found to be exerted primarily at the level of transcription. When DHT and EGF were added simultaneously to the cells. the level of AR mRNA was reduced to the same degree as was accomplished by the addition of EGF alone. On the other hand. the level of AR protein increased but this increase was about 70% of that attained following the addition of DHT alone. The stimulatory effects of EGF and DHT on cell proliferation were found to be additive.

Furthermore. the presence of a genomic fragment that included GsdfY converts XX individuals into fertile XX males. Luciferase assays demonstrated that the upstream sequence of GsdfY contributes to the male-specific high expression.

There seems to be five classes of ZP domain containing egg envelope genes in vertebrates: zpa. zpax. zpb. zpc. and zpd. zpa. zpax. and zpb are much closely related than zpc. There is an expanded family of teleost-specific zpc genes.

Terminal-nerve gonadotropin-releasing hormone 3 (TN-GnRH3) neurons. an extrahypothalamic neuromodulatory system. function as a gate for activating mating preferences based on familiarity. Basal levels of TN-GnRH3 neuronal activity suppress female receptivity for any male (default mode).

Up-regulation of transcripts of the 5' most exon is detectable 2-3 h before that of full-length TR beta mRNA. strongly suggesting that up-regulation is under transcriptional control. The TH-induced up-regulation in cultured cells is inhibited by cycloheximide when measured either by a transcription initiation assay that measures transcripts of the 5' most exon or by synthesis of full-length TR beta mRNA. From this we conclude that in cultured cells protein synthesis is required for up-regulation of TR beta mRNA.

Somatic cell constituents of the gonads were derived only from the lateral plate mesoderm. They differentiated into two types of cells. distinguished by the relation to germ cells and the presence of the basal lamina. around the time of hatching. One cell type differentiated into the Sertoli cells and efferent duct of the testis and into granulosa cells and epithelia lining the ovarian cavity in the ovary. The other cell type. after differentiation. formed the remaining part of the gonad. including the steroid producing cells. The timing of the first appearance of steroid producing cells was similar in both sexes and occurred following gonadal sex differentiation. Thus. these findings do not favor the hypothesis that steroid hormones are involved in the induction ofgonadal sex differentiation in the medaka. The compartmentation of spermatogonia in the testis was accomplished rather early; this compartmentation may be related to the delayed mitosis and meiosis of spermatogonia.

Previous studies have shown that N-myc expression significantly decreases when the stem cells are subjected to long-term induction for differentiation by retinoic acid (RA). We found that in a stem cell line. OTF9. a steep yet transient decrease of N-myc expression takes place much earlier. immediately after induction by RA. To examine whether this decrease is responsible for differentiation. we constructed a gene. miwNmyc. to express N-myc cDNA constitutively and transformed OTF9 cells with this gene construct. Transformants under the constitutive expression of miwNmyc differentiated normally. as judged by morphological changes and by modulation of c-myc. Hox1.1. and laminin B1 expression.

Behavioral experiments often indicate an important role for visual cues in fish. but their molecular basis remains almost entirely unknown. Studies on model species (such as zebrafish and medaka) allow investigations into this fundamental question in behavioral and evolutionary biology. Through mate-choice experiences using several laboratory strains of various body colors. we successfully identified one medaka mutant (color interfere; ci) that is distinctly unattractive to reproductive partners. This unattractiveness seems to be due to reduced orange pigment cells (xanthophores) in the skin. The ci strain carries a mutation on the somatolactin alpha (SLa) gene. therefore we expected over-expression of SLa to make medaka hyper-attractive.

Visual pigments in the retinal photoreceptor cells are responsible for receiving light stimuli. but the function of the pigments in vivo has not been directly investigated in many animals due to the lack of color-blind lines and appropriate color-perception tests. In this study. we established a system for producing color-blind fish and testing their spectral sensitivity. First. we disrupted long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) opsins of medaka (Oryzias latipes) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to make red-color-blind lines. Single guide RNAs were designed using the consensus sequences between the paralogous LWSa and LWSb genes to simultaneously introduce double-frameshift mutations. Next. we developed a non-invasive and no-prior-learning test for spectral sensitivity by applying an optomotor response (OMR) test under an Okazaki Large Spectrograph (OLS). termed the O-O test. We constructed an electrical-rotary cylinder with black/white stripes. into which a glass aquarium containing one or more fish was placed under various monochromatic light conditions.

In the present study. we investigated the mate choice of these red-blind fish. The colour variants with normal colour vision strongly preferred to mate with their own strain. The red-blind ones also preferred their own strain; i.e. they still mated assortatively. However. their preference was significantly weaker than that of fish with normal colour vision. In other words. the red-blind fish showed increased sexual interest in the other colour variant.

However. see-through fish are less vital than normally pigmented wild-type fish. which allows only skilled researchers to make the most of their advantages. Expecting that hybrid vigor (heterosis) would increase the vitality. we outcrossed two see-through strains (SK2 and STIII) with a genetically distant wild-type strain (HNI). Fish with the see-through phenotypes were successfully restored in the F2 generation and maintained as closed colonies.

Considerable evidence supports the theory that a CNS evolved just once. However. an alternative view proposes that the chordate CNS evolved from the ectodermal nerve net of a hemichordate-like ancestral deuterostome. implying independent evolution of the CNS in chordates and protostomes. To specify morphological divisions along the anterior/posterior axis. this ancestor used gene networks homologous to those patterning three organizing centers in the vertebrate brain: the anterior neural ridge. the zona limitans intrathalamica and the isthmic organizer. and subsequent evolution of the vertebrate brain involved elaboration of these ancestral signaling centers; however. all or part of these signaling centers were lost from the CNS of invertebrate chordates.

We isolated transcripts differentially expressed during metamorphosis in the ascidian Boltenia villosa by suppressive PCR subtractions of staged larval and juvenile cDNAs. We employed a series of three subtractions to dissect gene expression during metamorphosis. We have isolated 132 different protein coding sequences. and 65 of these transcripts show significant matches to GenBank proteins. Some of these genes have putative functions relevant to key metamorphic events including the differentiation of smooth muscle. blood cells. heart tissue and adult nervous system from larval rudiments.

A Wiley Company,Ascidians have evolved alternate modes of development in which the conventional tadpole larva is remodeled or eliminated. Adultation. the precocious development of adult features in the larval head. is caused by superimposing the larval and adult differentiation programs. Caudalization. the addition of muscle cells to the larval tail. is caused by enhancing muscle induction or increasing the number of muscle cell divisions before terminal differentiation. Adultation and caudalization are correlated with increased egg size. suggesting dependence on maternal processes. Anural development. the elimination of the larval stage. is caused by maternal and zygotic events resulting in abbreviation and deletion of larval developmental programs. An example of a maternal change in anural species is the modification of the egg cytoskeleton during oogenesis. whereas a zygotic change may involve altered cell interactions …,True,M4v_dwsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,105,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bies.950140404,9037430770650198722,/scholar?cites=9037430770650198722,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41877509/Evolution_of_Alternate_Modes_of_Developm20160202-507-10o7cgb.pdf,0,0,0

The chordates exhibit a unique body plan that evolved from a deuterostome ancestor some time before the Cambrian. Molecular data gathered from phylogenetics and developmental gene expression has changed our perception of the relationships within and between deuterostome phyla. Recent developmental gene expression data has shown that the chordates use similar gene families and networks to specify their anterior‐posterior. dorsal‐ventral and left‐right body axes. The anterior‐posterior axis is similarly established among deuterostomes and is determined by a related family of transcription factors. the Hox gene clusters and Wnt signaling pathways.

Anural and urodele ascidians constitute a model system in which to study the evolution of development. but the phylogeny of anural development has not been resolved.

Echinoderms have either radial or bilateral symmetry. hemichordates include bilateral enteropneust worms and colonial pterobranchs. and chordates possess a defined dorsal–ventral axis imposed on their anterior–posterior axis.

Here we present evidence that a Ciona homolog of snail (Ci-sna) encodes a repressor of the Ci-Bra enhancer in the tail muscles. DNA-binding assays identified four Ci-Sna-binding sites in the Ci-Bra enhancer. and mutations in these sites cause otherwise normal Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes to be misexpressed in ectopic tissues. particularly the tail muscles. Selective misexpression of Ci-sna using a heterologous promoter results in the repression of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the notochord. Moreover. the conversion of the Ci-Sna repressor into an activator results in the ectopic induction of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the muscles. and also causes an intermixing of notochord and muscle cells during tail morphogenesis.

Although the atrial epithelium has been believed to be undifferentiated. we found that this epithelium of P. misakiensis strongly expressed a tissue‐restricted antigen. named Pae 1. Cross‐reactivity of the antibody was found only in a few differentiated tissues such as branchial epithelium and phagocyte‐like cells. In developing buds. the antigen disappeared selectively from the regions where the atrial epithelium forms organ rudiments. These regions corresponded with that of mitotic activity. thickening of the epithelium. swelling of nuclei. the appearance of nucleoli and accumulation of a large amount of RNA. From these observations. we assume that the change in antigen expression indicates a change in the state of differentiation of the atrial epithelium.

This enhancer element drives the transcription of a lacZ reporter gene in the epidermis in the posterior trunk and the anterior tail region of tailbud-stage embryos. Inhibition of retinoic acid synthesis resulted in inactivation of the expression of the reporter gene. The enhancer contains a putative retinoic acid response element.

However. recent studies have demonstrated that some retrotransposed genes are transcriptionally active. Because promoters are not thought to be retrotransposed along with exonic sequences. these transcriptionally active genes must have acquired a functional promoter by mechanisms that are yet to be determined. Hence. comparison between a retrotransposed gene and its source gene appears to provide a unique opportunity to investigate the promoter creation for a new gene.

Uterine leiomyoma (LM). a benign tumor of myometrial origin. is the most common among women of childbearing age. Because of their similar symptoms. it is difficult to preoperatively distinguish the two conditions only by ultrasound and pelvic MRI. While histopathological diagnosis is currently the main approach used to distinguish them postoperatively. unusual histologic variants of LM tend to be misdiagnosed as LMS. Therefore. development of molecular diagnosis as an alternative or confirmatory means will help to diagnose LMS more accurately. We adopted omics-based technologies to identify genome-wide features to distinguish LMS from LM and revealed that copy number. gene expression. and DNA methylation profiles successfully distinguished these tumors. LMS was found to possess features typically observed in malignant solid tumors. such as extensive chromosomal abnormalities. overexpression of cell cycle-related genes. hypomethylation spreading through large genomic regions. and frequent hypermethylation at the polycomb group target genes and protocadherin genes.

Normal human diploid fibroblast TIG-3 cells have often been used in cellular senescence research; however. their epigenetic profiles are still not fully understood. To elucidate how cellular senescence is epigenetically regulated in TIG-3 cells. we analyzed the gene expression and DNA methylation profiles of three types of senescent cells. namely. replicatively senescent. ras-induced senescent (RIS). and non-permissive temperature-induced senescent SVts8 cells. using gene expression and DNA methylation microarrays.

1156572,The pattern of Nodal morphogen signaling is shaped by co-receptor expression,2019,Nathan D Lord and Adam N Carte and Philip B Abitua and Alexander F Schier,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Embryos must communicate instructions to their constituent cells over long distances. These instructions are often encoded in the concentration of signals called morphogens. In the textbook view. morphogen molecules diffuse from a localized source to form a concentration gradient. and target cells adopt fates by measuring the local morphogen concentration. However. natural patterning systems often incorporate numerous co-factors and extensive signaling feedback. suggesting that embryos require additional mechanisms to generate signaling patterns. Here. we examine the mechanisms of signaling pattern formation for the mesendoderm inducer Nodal during zebrafish embryogenesis. We find that Nodal signaling activity spans a normal range in the absence of signaling feedback. suggesting that diffusion is sufficient for Nodal gradient formation. We further show that the range of endogenous Nodal ligands is set by the EGF-CFC co-receptor Oep: in the absence of Oep. Nodal ligands spread to form a nearly uniform distribution throughout the embryo. In turn. increasing Oep levels sensitizes cells to Nodal ligands. We recapitulate these experimental results with a computational model in which Oep regulates the diffusive spread of Nodal ligands by setting the rate of capture by target cells. This model predicts. and we confirm in vivo. the surprising observation that a failure to replenish Oep during patterning transforms the Nodal signaling gradient into a travelling wave. These results reveal that patterns of Nodal morphogen signaling are shaped by co-receptor-mediated restriction of ligand spread and cell sensitization.,True,5Uv-BwMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.30.891101v1.abstract,13152825303194504126,/scholar?cites=13152825303194504126,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/12/30/2019.12.30.891101.full.pdf,0,0,0

This report concerns 5 identification of avian RFRP (gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone. GnIH) from the chicken. Chromosome-wide synteny conservation demonstrated the orthologous relationships among vertebrate RFRPs. The consensus motif for RFRP was modified to Pro-Xaa-Arg-Phe-NH2. We also describe the first identification of two distinct types of receptors for non-mammalian RFRP (RFRPR and NPFFR) from the chicken.

The 5’-flanking regions of chicken RFRPR and NPFFR suggested their expressions in the pituitary gland. and this was confirmed by the RT-PCR analysis. Localizations of both chicken RFRP and its receptors were distinct from those of mammals. These results indicated that avian RFRP. unlike the mammalian one. directly acts on the pituitary gland via receptors to regulate gonadotropin release.

The roles of GnRH in the control of vertebrate reproductive functions have been established. while its non-reproductive function has been suggested but less well understood. Here we show that the tunicate Ciona intestinalis has in its non-reproductive larval stage a prominent GnRH system spanning the entire length of the nervous system. Tunicate GnRH receptors are phylogenetically closest to vertebrate GnRH receptors. yet functional analysis of the receptors revealed that these simple chordates have evolved a unique GnRH system with multiple ligands and receptor heterodimerization enabling complex regulation. One of the gnrh genes is conspicuously expressed in the motor ganglion and nerve cord. which are homologous structures to the hindbrain and spinal cord of vertebrates. Correspondingly. GnRH receptor genes were found to be expressed in the tail muscle and notochord of embryos. both of which are phylotypic axial structures along the nerve cord.

1156602,Allorecognition in compound ascidians.,2002,Y Saito and E Hirose and H Watanabe,38,,2,237-247,UPV/EHU Press,In botryllids (colonial ascidians). there are two types of allorecognition: colony specificity and colony resorption. Colony specificity is manifested by fusion and rejection between two conspecific colonies. The genetic basis for this colony specificity resides in a single highly polymorphic gene locus (fusibility locus) with codominantly expressed alleles. Two colonies with no alleles in common at this locus reject each other. whereas colonies sharing at least one allele at the fusibility locus fuse and form a chimera. That is. in colony specificity. self components are distinguished from nonself components. and failure to recognize self induces rapid rejection reactions. The process of rejection in colony specificity is not uniform among all botryllid ascidians. Colony resorption can occur after the establishment of fusion between two colonies. Zooids of one partner of a chimera are resorbed more than 1 week after fusion. or. by amputation of fused blood vessels. the chimera becomes separated into the two original colonies. Colony resorption is also controlled mainly by the fusibility locus. It usually occurs in a chimera between two colonies sharing only one allele at this locus. In colony resorption. nonself determinants are recognized and chronic rejection reactions are induced resembling MHC-dependent graft rejection. Based on these findings. the fusibility locus of botryllids seems to be very similar to the MHC of vertebrates. Considering that vertebrates evolved directly from ascidians. it is likely that the fusibility locus is an ancestral form of the vertebrate MHC.,True,gZx2vRUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,90,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/7981033,3147929770047198509,/scholar?cites=3147929770047198509,,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/7981033,0,0,0

Gastropoda) retains photosynthetically active chloroplasts from ingested algae (functional kleptoplasts) in the epithelial cells of its digestive gland for up to 10 months. While its feeding behavior has not been observed in natural habitats. two hypotheses have been proposed: 1) adult P. ocellatus uses kleptoplasts to obtain photosynthates and nutritionally behaves as a photoautotroph without replenishing the kleptoplasts; or 2) it behaves as a mixotroph (photoautotroph and herbivorous consumer) and replenishes kleptoplasts continually or periodically. To address the question of which hypothesis is more likely. we examined the source algae for kleptoplasts and temporal changes in kleptoplast composition and nutritional contribution. By characterizing the temporal diversity of P. ocellatus kleptoplasts using rbcL sequences. we found that P. ocellatus harvests kleptoplasts from at least 8 different siphonous green algal species. that kleptoplasts from more than one species are present in each individual sea slug. and that the kleptoplast composition differs temporally. These results suggest that wild P. ocellatus often feed on multiple species of siphonous algae from which they continually obtain fresh chloroplasts. By estimating the trophic position of wild and starved P. ocellatus using the stable nitrogen isotopic composition of amino acids. we showed that despite the abundance of kleptoplasts. their photosynthates do not contribute greatly to the nutrition of wild P. ocellatus. but that kleptoplast photosynthates form a significant source of nutrition for starved sea slugs.

There are about 30 species of host ascidians that are all belong to four genera of the family Didemnidae. Asicidiancyanobacteria symbiosis has attracted considerable attention as a source of biomedicals: many bioactive compounds were isolated from photosymbiotic ascidians and many of them are supposed to be originated from the photosymbionts. Since the stable in vitro culture of Prochloron has never been established. there are many unsolved question about the biology of Prochloron. Recent genetic. physiological. biochemical. and morphological studies are partly disclosing various aspects of its enigmatic life. eg. photophysiology. metabolite synthesis. symbiosis. and evolution.

These animals are becoming increasingly important research subjects in biochemistry and other research fields. Their inclusion of both calcium and silica results in the need for both decalcification and desilification for internal morphological examinations. Since the methodology of hydrofluoric acid (HF) desilification has rarely been documented in zoanthids. histological surveys for zoanthid taxonomy have often been abandoned and their taxonomy is often problematic. Recent investigations utilizing molecular methods have brought a clearer understanding of zoanthid diversity. but standardization of HF treatments are still needed to provide a link between molecular and more traditional …,True,gZx2vRUAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,37,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10126-009-9249-3.pdf,16490445552610236651,/scholar?cites=16490445552610236651,,http://miseryukyu.com/MISE@University_of_the_Ryukyus/Publication_List_files/Reimeretal2010MBT.pdf,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Lamprey. the living jawless vertebrate. has been regarded as one of the most primitive groups of vertebrates. The evolutionary phylogenetic position of the lamprey promises to provide hints about the origin of the vertebrate genome as well as the origin of the body plan. a part of which may be written in the genome. Since the lamprey split from the gnathostome lineage early in the history of vertebrates. the shared developmental mechanisms in lampreys and gnathostomes can be regarded as possessed by the hypothetical common ancestor of these animals. whereas the gnathostome‐specific developmental mechanisms that are absent from lampreys indicate that they are relatively new. added to the developmental program only after the split of gnathostomes. Thus. the sequential establishment of the gnathostome body plan is inherently related to the history of genomic duplication events.

Lampetra japonica. Though it never forms a jointed jaw apparatus. the L. japonica embryo exhibits the typical embryonic structure as well as the conserved regulatory gene expression patterns of vertebrates. The lamprey therefore shares the phylotype of vertebrates. the conserved embryonic pattern that appears at pharyngula stage. rather than representing an intermediate evolutionary state. Both gnathostomes and lampreys exhibit a tripartite configuration of the rostral–most crest–derived ectomesenchyme. each part occupying an anatomically equivalent site. Differentiated oral structure becomes apparent in post–pharyngula development.

BioCreAtIvE focused on two tasks. The first dealt with extraction of gene or protein names from text. and their mapping into standardized gene identifiers for three model organism databases (fly. mouse. yeast). The second task addressed issues of functional annotation. requiring systems to identify specific text passages that supported Gene Ontology annotations for specific proteins. given full text articles. The first BioCreAtIvE assessment achieved a high level of international participation (27 groups from 10 countries). The assessment provided state-of-the-art performance results for a basic task (gene name finding and normalization). where the best systems achieved a balanced 80% precision / recall or better. which potentially makes them suitable for real applications in biology. The results for the advanced task (functional annotation from free text) were significantly lower. demonstrating the current limitations of text-mining approaches where knowledge extrapolation and interpretation are required.

Inc.,The widening gap between known protein sequences and their functions has led to the practice of assigning a potential function to a protein on the basis of sequence similarity to proteins whose function has been experimentally investigated. We present here a critical view of the theoretical and practical bases for this approach. The results obtained by analyzing a significant number of true sequence similarities. derived directly from structural alignments. point to the complexity of function prediction. Different aspects of protein function. including (i) enzymatic function classification. (ii) functional annotations in the form of key words. (iii) classes of cellular function. and (iv) conservation of binding sites can only be reliably transferred between similar sequences to a modest degree.

Based on this observation. techniques have been developed to predict interaction partners. The observed degree of similarity between the phylogenetic trees of two proteins is the result of many different factors besides the actual interaction or functional relationship between them. Such factors influence the performance of interaction predictions. One aspect that can influence this similarity is related to the fact that a given protein interacts with many others. and hence it must adapt to all of them. Accordingly. the interaction or coadaptation signal within its tree is a composite of the influence of all of the interactors.

Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach. using chromatin assortativity. to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the association of these features with the topology of four chromatin interaction networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network. Polycomb group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centered networks. We then ask which features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared with inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements.

As a result. protein interaction surfaces are subject to strong evolutionary constraints. Recent developments have shown that residue coevolution provides accurate predictions of heterodimeric protein interfaces from sequence information. So far these approaches have been limited to the analysis of families of prokaryotic complexes for which large multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences can be compiled. We explore the hypothesis that coevolution points to structurally conserved contacts at protein–protein interfaces. which can be reliably projected to homologous complexes with distantly related sequences. We introduce a domain-centered protocol to study the interplay between residue coevolution and structural conservation of protein–protein interfaces.

One application of this concept is the prediction of the mapping between the members of two interacting protein families (which protein within one family interacts with which protein within the other). The idea is that the real mapping would be the one maximizing the similarity between the trees. Since the exhaustive exploration of all possible mappings is not feasible for large families. current approaches use heuristic techniques which do not ensure the best solution to be found. This is why it is important to check the results proposed by heuristic techniques and to manually explore other solutions. Here we present TSEMA. the server for efficient mapping assessment.

1156753,Intronic CNVs and gene expression variation in human populations,2019,Maria Rigau and David Juan and Alfonso Valencia and Daniel Rico,15,PLoS genetics,1,e1007902,Public Library of Science,Introns can be extraordinarily large and they account for the majority of the DNA sequence in human genes. However. little is known about their population patterns of structural variation and their functional implication. By combining the most extensive maps of CNVs in human populations. we have found that intronic losses are the most frequent copy number variants (CNVs) in protein-coding genes in human. with 12.986 intronic deletions. affecting 4.147 genes (including 1.154 essential genes and 1.638 disease-related genes). This intronic length variation results in dozens of genes showing extreme population variability in size. with 40 genes with 10 or more different sizes and up to 150 allelic sizes. Intronic losses are frequent in evolutionarily ancient genes that are highly conserved at the protein sequence level. This result contrasts with losses overlapping exons. which are observed less often than expected by chance and almost exclusively affect primate-specific genes. An integrated analysis of CNVs and RNA-seq data showed that intronic loss can be associated with significant differences in gene expression levels in the population (CNV-eQTLs). These intronic CNV-eQTLs regions are enriched for intronic enhancers and can be associated with expression differences of other genes showing long distance intron-promoter 3D interactions. Our data suggests that intronic structural variation of protein-coding genes makes an important contribution to the variability of gene expression and splicing in human populations.,True,PhBPj4cAAAAJ:ZOYfmFL0FrgC,25,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007902,10147693439872242725,/scholar?cites=10147693439872242725,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007902,0,0,0

These similarities can be used to predicting the mapping between two families of interacting proteins (i.e. which proteins from one family interact with which members of the other). The correct mapping will be that which maximizes the similarity between the trees. The two families may eventually comprise orthologs and paralogs. if members of the two families are present in more than one organism. This fact can be exploited to restrict the possible mappings. simply by impeding links between proteins of different organisms.

From a practical point of view. coevolution between protein families has been used as a way of detecting protein interactions and functional relationships from genomic information. The most common approach to inferring protein coevolution involves the quantification of phylogenetic tree similarity using a family of methodologies termed mirrortree. In spite of their success. a fundamental problem of these approaches is the lack of an adequate statistical framework to assess the significance of a given coevolutionary score (tree similarity).

In Bptf-null MEFs. BPTF is necessary for c-MYC-driven proliferation. G1–S progression and replication stress. but not for c-MYC-driven apoptosis. Bioinformatics analyses unveil that BPTF levels correlate positively with c-MYC-driven transcriptional signatures. In vivo.

To date. large-scale investigations into the pattern of transcript expression across distinct tissues have produced contradictory results. Here. we attempt to determine whether genes express a dominant splice variant at the protein level. We interrogate peptides from eight large-scale human proteomics experiments and databases and find that there is a single dominant protein isoform. irrespective of tissue or cell type. for the vast majority of the protein-coding genes in these experiments. in partial agreement with the conclusions from the most recent large-scale RNAseq study.

Paul,18,Genome Biology,1,18,,A healthy immune system requires immune cells that adapt rapidly to environmental challenges. This phenotypic plasticity can be mediated by transcriptional and epigenetic variability. We apply a novel analytical approach to measure and compare transcriptional and epigenetic variability genome-wide across CD14+CD16− monocytes. CD66b+CD16+ neutrophils. and CD4+CD45RA+ naïve T cells from the same 125 healthy individuals. We discover substantially increased variability in neutrophils compared to monocytes and T cells. In neutrophils. genes with hypervariable expression are found to be implicated in key immune pathways and are associated with cellular properties and environmental exposure. We also observe increased sex-specific gene expression differences in neutrophils. Neutrophil-specific DNA methylation hypervariable sites are enriched at dynamic chromatin regions and active enhancers.

Roles in liver regeneration have been suggested for T3. but there is no clear evidence distinguishing the contribution of increased amounts of T3 from the modulation by unoccupied TRs.  Methodology/Principal Findings Mice lacking TRα1/TRβ or TRβ alone fully regenerated liver mass after PH. but showed delayed commitment to the initial round of hepatocyte proliferation and transient but intense apoptosis at 48h post-PH. affecting ∼30% of the remaining hepatocytes. Pharmacologically induced hypothyroidism yielded similar results. Loss of TR activity was associated with enhanced nitrosative stress in the liver remnant. due to an increase in the activity of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 2 and 3. caused by a transient decrease in the concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). a potent NOS inhibitor. This decrease in the ADMA levels was due to the presence of a higher activity of dimethylarginineaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1) in the regenerating liver of animals lacking TRα1/TRβ or TRβ. DDAH-1 expression and activity was paralleled by the activity of FXR. a transcription factor involved in liver regeneration and up-regulated in the absence of TR.  Conclusions/Significance We report that TRs are not required for liver regeneration; however. hypothyroid mice and TRβ– or TRα1/TRβ–deficient mice exhibit a delay in the restoration of liver mass. suggesting a specific role for TRβ in liver regeneration.

Enrichments of functional or other biological properties within such lists can provide valuable insights and testable hypotheses. To systematically detect these enrichments can be challenging and time-consuming. because relevant data to compare against query gene lists are spread over many different sources. We have developed AnGeLi (Analysis of Gene Lists). an intuitive. integrated web-tool for comprehensive and customized interrogation of gene lists from the fission yeast. Schizosaccharomyces pombe. AnGeLi searches for significant enrichments among multiple qualitative and quantitative information sources. including gene and phenotype ontologies. genetic and protein interactions. numerous features of genes. transcripts. translation. and proteins such as copy numbers. chromosomal positions. genetic diversity. RNA polymerase II and ribosome occupancy. localization. conservation. half-lives. domains and molecular weight among others. as well as diverse sets of genes that are co-regulated or lead to the same phenotypes when mutated. AnGeLi uses robust statistics which can be tailored to specific needs. It also provides the option to upload user-defined gene sets to compare against the query list. Through an integrated data submission form. AnGeLi encourages the community to contribute additional curated gene lists to further increase the usefulness of this resource and to get the most from the ever increasing large-scale experiments.

IgVH mutated (M-CLL) and IgVH unmutated (U-CLL). So far. these two subtypes are not associated to clear differences in gene expression profiles. Interestingly. recent results have highlighted important roles for heterogeneity. both at the genetic and at the epigenetic level in CLL progression. We analyzed gene expression data of two large cohorts of CLL patients and quantified expression variability across individuals to investigate differences between the two subtypes using different measures and statistical tests. Functional significance was explored by pathway enrichment and network analyses. Furthermore. we implemented a random forest approach based on expression variability to classify patients into disease subtypes. We found that U-CLL. the more aggressive type of the disease. shows significantly increased variability of gene expression across patients and that. overall. genes that show higher variability in the aggressive subtype are related to cell cycle. development and inter-cellular communication. These functions indicate a potential relation between gene expression variability and the faster progression of this CLL subtype. Finally. a classifier based on gene expression variability was able to correctly predict the disease subtype of CLL patients.

Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach. using chromatin assortativity. to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution promoter capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the association of these features with the topology of four chromatin interaction networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network. Polycomb group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centered networks. We then ask which features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared with inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among promoters and between promoters and other elements have different characteristic epigenomic features.

The important role of ROS in cell survival requires detailed investigation of mechanism and determinants of ROS production. To perform such an investigation we extended our rule-based model of complex III in order to account for electron transport in the whole RC coupled to proton translocation. transmembrane electrochemical potential generation. TCA cycle reactions. and substrate transport to mitochondria. It fits respiratory electron fluxes measured in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate. and the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I. The fitting of measured characteristics gave an insight into the mechanism of underlying processes governing the formation of free radicals that can transfer an unpaired electron to oxygen-producing superoxide and thus can initiate the generation of ROS. Our analysis revealed an association of ROS production with levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III. It was found that the phenomenon of bistability. revealed previously as a property of complex III. remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted based on theoretical analysis and were confirmed experimentally …,True,J5RXcScAAAAJ:ZHo1McVdvXMC,131,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001115,7106663092680156533,/scholar?cites=7106663092680156533,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001115,0,0,0

Here we analytically demonstrate that double phosphorylation of a protein (or other covalent modification) generates bistability only if: (a) the two phosphorylation (or the two dephosphorylation) reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme; (b) the kinetics operate at least partly in the zero‐order region; and (c) the ratio of the catalytic constants of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps in the first modification cycle is less than this ratio in the second cycle.

Thus the ultimate goal of systems biology is to predict the behaviour of the whole system on the basis of the list of components involved. Recent advances in ‘-omics’ technologies and the development of new computational techniques and algorithms have greatly contributed to progress in this field of biology. Among the main ‘-omics’ technologies. metabolomics is expected to play a significant role in bridging the phenotype–genotype gap. since it amplifies changes in the proteome and provides a better representation of the phenotype of an organism than other methods. However. knowledge of the complete set of metabolites is not enough to predict the phenotype. especially for higher cells in which the distinct metabolic processes involved in their production and degradation are finely regulated and interconnected.

The strategies that might modulate the expression and secretion of these AMPs. leading to enhanced antimicrobial effect are highlighted. Furthermore. studies evaluating the presence of AMPs in the cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs) are underlined as perspective opportunities to develop new drug delivery tools.

The polymorphism at position _308 (TNF-308). which involves substituting G for A and designing the TNF2 allele. leads to a higher rate of TNF gene transcription than the wild-type TNF1 allele in in vitro expression studies. It has also been linked to increased susceptibility to a variety of illnesses. Using PCR-RFLP analysis we detected significant differences in the TNF-308 genotypes of Chilean and other populations.

Here. we aimed at identifying a miRNA signature of purified B cells from renal and non-renal severe SLE patients of Latin American background. a population known to express severe disease. Genome-wide miRNA expression analyses were performed on naive and memory B cells and revealed two categories of miRNA signatures. The first signature represents B cell subset-specific miRNAs deregulated in SLE: 11 and six miRNAs discriminating naive and memory B cells of SLE patients from healthy controls (HC). respectively. Whether the miRNA was up or down-regulated in memory B cells as compared with naive B cells in HC. this difference was abolished in SLE patients. and vice versa. The second signature identifies six miRNAs associated with specific pathologic features affecting renal outcome. providing a further understanding for SLE pathogenesis.

Analyses of 38 AML samples through integrated transcriptional and chromatin mark analysis exposes 2 major subtypes. One subtype is dominated by patients with NPM1 mutations or MLL-fusion genes. shows activation of the regulatory pathways involving HOX-family genes as targets. and displays high self-renewal capacity and stemness. The second subtype is enriched for RUNX1 or spliceosome mutations. suggesting potential interplay between the 2 aberrations. and mainly depends on IRF family regulators. Cellular consequences in prognosis predict a relatively worse outcome for the first subtype.

1156957,Evolution of microsatellite DNA,2013,Iris M Vargas Jentzsch and Andrew TM Bagshaw and Emmanuel Buschiazzo and Angelika Merkel and Neil J Gemmell,,eLS,,,American Cancer Society,Microsatellites are highly mutable nucleotide arrays composed of short motifs repeated in tandem. They are ubiquitously distributed in bacterial and eukaryotic genomes and their abundance and mutability has made them a widely used genetic marker for a variety of applications. One aim of the study of microsatellite evolution is to predict their mutational patterns in order to make them more accurate markers of genetic distance between species or individuals. Applications that use microsatellites as markers work under the basic assumption that microsatellite mutations are simple and random. However. this assumption contrasts with the observed variability of mutation rates across microsatellite loci. Several factors such as array size and sequence motif have been shown to influence microsatellite mutation rates. but research into their evolution is also complicated by the fact that some microsatellites function to …,True,ZKMqXQkAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,12,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9780470015902.a0020847.pub2,12553992898429441567,/scholar?cites=12553992898429441567,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil_Gemmell/publication/280736782_Evolution_of_microsatellite_DNA/links/5aae3104458515ecebe83606/Evolution-of-microsatellite-DNA.pdf,0,0,0

Previously. we described the presence of DNA hyper- and hypo-methylation alterations in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived DAn from PD patients using the Illumina 450K array which prominently covers gene regulatory regions. To expand and contextualize previous findings. we performed the first whole-genome DNA bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) using iPSC-derived DAn from representative PD subjects: one sporadic PD (sPD) patient. one monogenic LRRK2-associated PD patient (L2PD). and one control. At the whole-genome level. we detected global DNA hyper-methylation in the PD which was similarly spread across the genome in both sPD and L2PD and mostly affected intergenic regions. This study implements previous epigenetic knowledge in PD at a whole genome level providing the first comprehensive and unbiased CpG DNA methylation data using iPSC-derived DAn from PD patients. Our results indicate that DAn from monogenic or sporadic PD exhibit global DNA hyper-methylation changes.

Currently. whole genome sequencing of bisulfite converted DNA (WGBS) represents the gold standard for studying DNA methylation at genomic level. Contrary to other techniques. it provides an unbiased view of the entire genome at single base pair resolution. However. in practice. due to its (until recently) comparatively high cost. its application for the analysis of large data sets (i.e. > 50 samples) has been lagging behind other more cost-efficient platforms. such as for example the Illumina microarrays (Infinium 27K. 450k and EPIC). Subsequently. despite the variety of software tools that exist for the analysis of WGBS. processing of large datasets still remains cumbersome. We present GEMBS. a bioinformatics pipeline specifically designed for the analysis of large WGBS data sets. GEMBS is based on two core modules: GEM3. a high performance read aligner. and BScall. a variant caller specifically for bisulfite sequencing data. Both components are embedded in a highly parallel workflow enabling highly efficient and reliable execution in a HPC environment. In this study. we benchmark GEMBS performance against other common analysis tools and show how GEMBS can be used for accurate variant calling from WGBS data.,True,ZKMqXQkAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,5,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/12/201988.full.pdf,16864508412016074519,/scholar?cites=16864508412016074519,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/12/12/201988.full.pdf,0,0,0

We collected RNA-seq data. ChIP-seq of six histone modifications and of DNA methylation by bisulfite sequencing at base pair resolution from up to 6 individuals per cell type. Chromatin segmentation analyses suggested that monocytes have a higher number of cell-specific enhancer regions (4-fold) compared to neutrophils. This highly plastic epigenome is likely indicative of the greater differentiation potential of monocytes into macrophages. dendritic cells and osteoclasts. In contrast. most of the neutrophil-specific features tend to be characterized by repressed chromatin. reflective of their status as terminally differentiated cells. Enhancers were the regions where most of differences in DNA methylation between cells were observed. with monocyte-specific enhancers being generally hypomethylated. Monocytes show a substantially higher gene expression levels than neutrophils. in line with epigenomic analysis revealing that gene more active elements in monocytes.

We identified 14 coding variants in 13 genes. of which 8 variants were in genes (ZBTB7B. ACHE. RAPGEF3. RAB21. ZFHX3. ENTPD6. ZFR2 and ZNF169) newly implicated in human obesity. 2 variants were in genes (MC4R and KSR2) previously observed to be mutated in extreme obesity and 2 variants were in GIPR.

Even when SNPs are located within CNVs. two separate association analyses are necessary. to compare the distribution of bi-allelic genotypes in cases and controls (referred to as SNP-only strategy) and the number of copies of a region (referred to as CNV-only strategy). However. when disease susceptibility is actually associated with allele specific copy-number states. the two strategies may not yield comparable results. raising a series of questions about the optimal analytical approach. We performed simulations of the performance of association testing under different scenarios that varied genotype frequencies and inheritance models. We show that the SNP-only strategy lacks power under most scenarios when the SNP is located within a CNV; frequently it is excluded from analysis as it does not pass quality control metrics either because of an increased rate of missing calls or a departure from fitness for Hardy-Weinberg proportion. The CNV-only strategy also lacks power because the association testing depends on the allele which copy number varies. The combined strategy performs well in most of the scenarios. Hence. we advocate the use of this combined strategy when testing for association with SNPs located within CNVs.,True,4BKQ1CcAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075350,9184760326509856678,/scholar?cites=9184760326509856678,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0075350,0,0,0

Functional analyses do not fully explain the selective pressure causing ERG rearrangement during the development of prostate cancer. To identify transcriptional changes in prostate cancer. including tumors with ERG gene rearrangements. we performed a meta-analysis on published gene expression data followed by validations on mRNA and protein levels as well as first functional investigations. Eight expression studies (n = 561) on human prostate tissues were included in the meta-analysis. Transcriptional changes between prostate cancer and non-cancerous prostate. as well as ERG rearrangement-positive (ERG+) and ERG rearrangement-negative (ERG−) prostate cancer. were analyzed. Detailed results can be accessed through an online database.

Selected targets were confirmed by immunohistochemistry: NPY and PLA2G7 (up-regulated in ERG+ cancers). and AZGP1 and TFF3 (down-regulated in ERG+ cancers).

1156998,Higher gene expression variability in the more aggressive subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukemia,2015,Simone Ecker and Vera Pancaldi and Daniel Rico and Alfonso Valencia,7,Genome Medicine,8,,,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presents two subtypes which have drastically different clinical outcomes. IgVH mutated (M-CLL) and IgVH unmutated (U-CLL). So far. these two subtypes are not associated to clear differences in gene expression profiles. Interestingly. recent results have highlighted important roles for heterogeneity. both at the genetic and at the epigenetic level in CLL progression. We analyzed gene expression data of two large cohorts of CLL patients and quantified expression variability across individuals to investigate differences between the two subtypes using different measures and statistical tests. Functional significance was explored by pathway enrichment and network analyses. Furthermore. we implemented a random forest approach based on expression variability to classify patients into disease subtypes. We found that U-CLL. the more aggressive type of the disease. shows significantly increased variability of gene expression across patients and that. overall. genes that show higher variability in the aggressive subtype are related to cell cycle. development and inter-cellular communication. These functions indicate a potential relation between gene expression variability and the faster progression of this CLL subtype. Finally. a classifier based on gene expression variability was able to correctly predict the disease subtype of CLL patients. There are strong relations between gene expression variability and disease subtype linking significantly increased expression variability to phenotypes such as aggressiveness and resistance to therapy in CLL.,True,TCB24ysAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,39,https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-014-0125-z?utm_campaign=BMCF_TrendMD_2020_GenomeMedicine&utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc,3533795977313041193,/scholar?cites=3533795977313041193,,https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-014-0125-z?utm_campaign=BMCF_TrendMD_2020_GenomeMedicine&utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc,0,0,0

Epigenome-wide association studies can identify environmentally mediated epigenetic changes such as altered DNA methylation. which may also be influenced by genetic factors. To investigate possible contributions of DNA methylation to the aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis with minimum confounding genetic heterogeneity. we investigated genome-wide DNA methylation in disease-discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in 79 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for rheumatoid arthritis using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina). Discordant twins were tested for both differential DNA methylation and methylation variability between rheumatoid arthritis and healthy twins. The methylation variability signature was then compared with methylation variants from studies of other autoimmune diseases and with an independent healthy population. We have identified a differentially variable DNA methylation signature that suggests multiple stress response pathways may be involved in the aetiology of the disease. This methylation variability signature also highlighted potential epigenetic disruption of multiple RUNX3 transcription factor binding sites as being associated with disease development.

As a result. GCs are included in almost all treatment protocols for lymphoid malignancies. particularly childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (chALL). The most commonly used synthetic GCs in the clinical setting are prednisolone and dexamethasone. While the latter has a higher activity and more effectively reduces the tumor load in patients. it is also accompanied by more serious adverse effects than the former. Whether this difference might be explained by regulation of different genes by the two GCs has never been addressed. Using a recently developed GC bioassay based on a GC-responsive reporter construct in human Jurkat T-ALL cells. we found ~7-fold higher biological activity with dexamethasone than prednisolone. Similarly. 1.0e-7 M dexamethasone and 7.0e-7 M prednisolone triggered similar cell death rates in CCRF-CEM-C7H2 T-chALL cells after 72 hours of treatment. Using microarray-based whole genome expression profiling and a variety of statistical and other approaches. we compared the transcriptional response of chALL cells to 6 hour exposure to both synthetic GCs at the above concentrations. Our experiments did not detect any gene whose regulation by dexamethasone differed significantly from that by prednisolone. Our findings suggest that the reported differences in treatment efficacy and cytotoxicity of dexamethasone and prednisolone are not caused by inherent differences of the 2 drugs to regulate the expression of certain genes. but rather result either from applying them in …,True,TCB24ysAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,23,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-662,13022762641060049908,/scholar?cites=13022762641060049908,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-662,0,0,0

Here we extend this paradigm to mammals. Ptentg mice carrying additional genomic copies of Pten are protected from cancer and present a significant extension of life span that is independent of their lower cancer incidence. Interestingly.

The brown adipose tissue (BAT) of Ptentg mice is hyperactive and presents high levels of the uncoupling protein Ucp1. which we show is a target of Foxo1.

We generated cells and mice deleted for Rap1; mice with Rap1 deletion in stratified epithelia were viable but had shorter telomeres and developed skin hyperpigmentation in adulthood. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with ultrahigh-throughput sequencing. we found that Rap1 binds to both telomeres and to extratelomeric sites through the (TTAGGG) 2 consensus motif.

Mouse embryos lacking SA1 show developmental delay and die before birth. Comparison of the genome‐wide distribution of cohesin in wild‐type and SA1‐null cells reveals that SA1 is largely responsible for cohesin accumulation at promoters and at sites bound by the insulator protein CTCF. As a consequence. ablation of SA1 alters transcription of genes involved in biological processes related to Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS). a genetic disorder linked to dysfunction of cohesin. We show that the presence of cohesin‐SA1 at the promoter of myc and of protocadherin genes positively regulates their expression. a task that cannot be assumed by cohesin‐SA2.

RAP1 also binds along chromosome arms. where it is proposed to regulate gene expression. To investigate the nontelomeric roles of RAP1 in vivo. we generated a RAP1 whole-body knockout mouse. These mice show early onset of obesity. which is more severe in females than in males. Rap1-deficient mice show accumulation of abdominal fat. hepatic steatosis. and high-fasting plasma levels of insulin. glucose. cholesterol. and alanine aminotransferase. Gene expression analyses of liver and visceral white fat from Rap1-deficient mice before the onset of obesity show deregulation of metabolic programs. including fatty acid. glucose metabolism. and PPARα signaling.

Here. we report an inherent dependency of melanoma cells on the small GTPase RAB7. identified within a lysosomal gene cluster that distinguishes this malignancy from over 35 tumor types. Analyses in human cells. clinical specimens. and mouse models demonstrated that RAB7 is an early-induced melanoma driver whose levels can be tuned to favor tumor invasion. ultimately defining metastatic risk. Importantly. RAB7 levels and function were independent of MITF. the best-characterized melanocyte lineage-specific transcription factor.

Although p38 SAPK signalling is known to participate in the regulation of gene expression little is known on the molecular mechanisms used by this SAPK to regulate stress-responsive genes and the overall set of genes regulated by p38 in response to different stimuli. Here. we report a whole genome expression analyses on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) treated with three different p38 SAPK activating-stimuli. namely osmostress. the cytokine TNFα and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. We have found that the activation kinetics of p38α SAPK in response to these insults is different and also leads to a complex gene pattern response specific for a given stress with a restricted set of overlapping genes. In addition. we have analysed the contribution of p38α the major p38 family member present in MEFs. to the overall stress-induced transcriptional response by using both a chemical inhibitor (SB203580) and p38α deficient (p38α-/-) MEFs. We show here that p38 SAPK dependency ranged between 60% and 88% depending on the treatments and that there is a very good overlap between the inhibitor treatment and the ko cells. Furthermore. we have found that the dependency of SAPK varies depending on the time the cells are subjected to osmostress. Our genome-wide transcriptional analyses shows a selective response to specific stimuli and a restricted common response of up to 20% of the stress up-regulated early genes that involves an important set of transcription factors. which might be critical for …,True,3VmC5bYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,77,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-11-144,10057428928832176512,/scholar?cites=10057428928832176512,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-11-144,0,0,0

We found three chromosome regions that provided evidence of disease association with p-values between 10−6 and 10−9. Two of these (IL23R on Chromosome 1 and CARD15 on Chromosome 16) correspond to genes previously reported to be associated with CD. In addition. a 250-kb region of Chromosome 5p13.1 was found to contain multiple markers with strongly suggestive evidence of disease association (including four markers with p < 10−7). We replicated the results for 5p13.1 by studying 1.266 additional CD patients. 559 additional controls. and 428 trios. Significant evidence of association (p < 4 × 10−4) was found in case/control comparisons with the replication data. while associated alleles were over-transmitted to affected offspring (p < 0.05). thus confirming that the 5p13.1 locus contributes to CD susceptibility. The CD-associated 250-kb region was saturated with 111 SNP markers. Haplotype analysis supports a complex locus architecture with multiple variants contributing to disease susceptibility. The novel 5p13.1 CD locus is contained within a 1.25-Mb gene desert. We present evidence that disease-associated alleles correlate with quantitative expression levels of the prostaglandin receptor EP4. PTGER4. the gene that resides closest to the associated region.

Its best-characterized function is the assembly of prereplicative complexes at origins of replication during the G1 phase of the cell division cycle. However. CDC6 also plays important roles in the activation and maintenance of the checkpoint mechanisms that coordinate S phase and mitosis. and recent studies have unveiled its proto-oncogenic activity. CDC6 overexpression interferes with the expression of INK4/ARF tumor suppressor genes through a mechanism involving the epigenetic modification of chromatin at the INK4/ARF locus. In addition. CDC6 overexpression in primary cells may promote DNA hyperreplication and induce a senescence response similar to that caused by oncogene activation.

The risk of fork collapse is higher in the presence of replication inhibitors or after UV irradiation. which introduces specific modifications in the structure of DNA. In these cases. fork progression may be facilitated by error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases. Alternatively. the replisome may skip the damaged DNA. leaving an unreplicated gap to be repaired after replication. This mechanism strictly requires a priming event downstream of the lesion.

One level of organization involves the formation of chromatin loops that may provide a favorable environment to processes such as DNA replication. transcription. and repair. However. little is known about the mechanistic basis of this structuration. Here we demonstrate that cohesin participates in the spatial organization of DNA replication factories in human cells. Cohesin is enriched at replication origins and interacts with prereplication complex proteins. Down-regulation of cohesin slows down S-phase progression by limiting the number of active origins and increasing the length of chromatin loops that correspond with replicon units.

The assembly of the pre-RC. which involves the loading of six MCM subunits (Mcm2–7). is a prerequisite for DNA replication. We found that cyclin E. through activation of Cdk2. promotes Mcm2 loading onto chromatin. This function is mediated in part by promoting the accumulation of Cdc7 messenger RNA and protein. which then phosphorylates Mcm2. Consistent with this. a phosphomimetic mutant of Mcm2 can bypass the requirement for Cdc7 in terms of Mcm2 loading. Furthermore. ectopic expression of both Cdc6 and Cdc7 can rescue the MCM loading defect associated with expression of dominant-negative Cdk2.

Crohn's disease and breast. prostate and colorectal (BPC) cancers. we determine that each of these traits is likely to harbor additional loci within the spectrum of low-penetrance common variants. These loci. which can be identified from sufficiently powerful GWASs. together could explain at least 15–20% of the known heritability of these traits.

Inc.,Haseman and Elston (HE)[1972] proposed a method to detect quantitative trait loci by linkage to a marker. The squared sib-pair trait difference is regressed on the proportion of marker alleles the pair is estimated to share identical by descent: a significantly negative regression coefficient suggests linkage. It has been shown that a maximum likelihood method that directly models the sib-pair covariance has more power. This increase in power can also be obtained using the HE regression procedure by changing the dependent variable from the squared difference to the mean-corrected product of the sibs' trait values. Multiple sibs in a sibship can be accommodated by allowing for the correlations between pairs of products in a generalized least squares procedure.

We investigated whether the associations between these SNPs and breast cancer risk varied by clinically important tumor characteristics in up to 23.039 invasive breast cancer cases and 26.273 controls from 20 studies. We also evaluated their influence on overall survival in 13.527 cases from 13 studies. All participants were of European or Asian origin. rs2981582 in FGFR2 was more strongly related to ER-positive (per-allele OR (95%CI) = 1.31 (1.27–1.36)) than ER-negative (1.08 (1.03–1.14)) disease (P for heterogeneity = 10−13). This SNP was also more strongly related to PR-positive. low grade and node positive tumors (P = 10−5. 10−8. 0.013. respectively). The association for rs13281615 in 8q24 was stronger for ER-positive.

Exploring Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for such lists of genes has become a widespread practice to get first insights into the potential biological meaning of the experiment. The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of GO terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of GO because they analyze each term in isolation.

Nigel Crawford and colleagues reported on the discovery of a distinct nitric oxide synthase (AtNOS1) in Arabidopsis thaliana that regulates growth and hormonal signaling in plants. Arabidopsis mutants (Atnos1) were found to be impaired in NO production and organ growth. Although the AtNOS1 sequence has no similarities to any mammalian NOS isoform. the cloned and purified AtNOS1 protein was demonstrated to use the substrates arginine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate to produce NO. AtNOS1 activity was dependent on Ca2+ and calmodulin. which has also been shown for other NOSs. Recent results from our laboratories raise critical questions regarding the function of AtNOS1. Over the past 2 years. we and several other groups have confirmed that basal NO production is impaired or that AtNOS1 mutants have a reduced capacity to mount a NO burst. although in some cases the picture was unclear [2–4]. Inspired by the original report by Crawford and colleagues [1]. we cloned AtNOS1 (Q66GP9) and the orthologous genes from rice (Q6YPG5) and maize (AY110367). Unfortunately. after purification of the recombinant proteins as described in Ref.[1] we failed to detect any NOS activity with an [3H]-arginine and Greiss reagent-based NOS assays [1].

The algorithms depend on the setting of various parameters. most notably gap penalties. The effect that such parameters have on the resulting alignments is still poorly understood. This paper begins by reviewing two recent advances in algorithms and probability that enable us to take a new approach to this question.

Systematic identification of the regulatory mechanisms that control these responses is still a challenge and requires tailored analyses integrating different types of molecular data. Here we acquired time-resolved metabolomics measurements in yeast under salt and pheromone stimulation and developed a machine learning approach to explore regulatory associations between metabolism and signal transduction. Existing phosphoproteomics measurements under the same conditions and kinase-substrate regulatory interactions were used to in silico estimate the enzymatic activity of signalling kinases. Our approach identified informative associations between kinases and metabolic enzymes capable of predicting metabolic changes. We extended our analysis to two studies containing transcriptomics. phosphoproteomics and metabolomics measurements across a comprehensive panel of kinases/phosphatases knockouts and time-resolved perturbations to the nitrogen metabolism. Changes in activity of transcription factors. kinases and phosphatases were estimated in silico and these were capable of building predictive models to infer the metabolic adaptations of previously unseen conditions across different dynamic experiments. Time-resolved experiments were significantly more informative than genetic perturbations to infer metabolic adaptation.

At the molecular level. co-evolutionary linkages between protein families have been used as indicators of protein interactions and functional relationships from long ago. Due to the complexity of the problem and the amount of genomic data required for these approaches to achieve good performances. it took a relatively long time from the appearance of the first ideas and concepts to the quotidian application of these approaches and their incorporation to the standard toolboxes of bioinformaticians and molecular biologists. Today. these methodologies are mature (both in terms of performance and usability/implementation). and the genomic information that feeds them large enough to allow their general application.

From a practical point of view. coevolution between protein families has been used as a way of detecting protein interactions and functional relationships from genomic information. The most common approach to inferring protein coevolution involves the quantification of phylogenetic tree similarity using a family of methodologies termed mirrortree. In spite of their success. a fundamental problem of these approaches is the lack of an adequate statistical framework to assess the significance of a given coevolutionary score (tree similarity). As a consequence. a number of ad hoc filters and arbitrary thresholds are required in an attempt to obtain a final set of confident coevolutionary signals.

Here. we integrated genomic and proteomic data for 5598 tumor samples to identify CNVs leading to aberrant signal transduction. The resulting associations recapitulated known kinase-substrate relationships and further network analysis prioritized likely driver genes. A total of 44 robust pan-cancer gene-phosphosite associations were replicated in cell line samples. Of these. ARHGEF17. a predicted regulator of hippo-signaling. was further studied through (phospho)proteomics analysis where ARHGEF17 knockdown cells showed dys-regulation of hippo- and p38 signaling as well as immune related pathways. Using. RNAi. CRISPR and drug screening data we find evidence of kinase addiction in cancer cell lines identifying inhibitors for targeting of ‘kinase-dependent’ cell lines.

From the simplest systems to complex mammal machineries. the interactions between different molecules usually determines the resulting phenotype. This is the case with cellular proteins. which rarely work in isolation but are frequently involved in pathways and interaction networks.

Testing Primer Bias and Biomass - Sequence Relationships with an Innovative Metabarcoding Protocol,2015,Vasco Elbrecht and Florian Leese,10,PLoS ONE,7,,,Metabarcoding is an emerging genetic tool to rapidly assess biodiversity in ecosystems. It involves high-throughput sequencing of a standard gene from an environmental sample and comparison to a reference database. However. no consensus has emerged regarding laboratory pipelines to screen species diversity and infer species abundances from environmental samples. In particular. the effect of primer bias and the detection limit for specimens with a low biomass has not been systematically examined. when processing samples in bulk. We developed and tested a DNA metabarcoding protocol that utilises the standard cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcoding fragment to detect freshwater macroinvertebrate taxa. DNA was extracted in bulk. amplified in a single PCR step. and purified. and the libraries were directly sequenced in two independent MiSeq runs (300-bp paired-end reads). Specifically. we assessed the influence of specimen biomass on sequence read abundance by sequencing 31 specimens of a stonefly species with known haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass (experiment I). Then. we tested the recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa of similar biomass using the same standard barcoding primers (experiment II). Each experiment was replicated ten times to maximise statistical power. The results of both experiments were consistent across replicates. We found a distinct positive correlation between species biomass and resulting numbers of MiSeq reads. Furthermore. we reliably recovered 83% of the 52 taxa used to test primer bias.

1157192,Validation and development of COI metabarcoding primers for freshwater macroinvertebrate bioassessment,2017,Vasco Elbrecht and Florian Leese,,Frontiers in Environmental Science,,,,A central challenge in the present era of biodiversity loss is to assess and manage human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Macroinvertebrates are an important group for bioassessment as many taxa show specific responses to environmental conditions. However. generating accurate macroinvertebrate inventories based on larval morphology is difficult and error-prone. Here. DNA metabarcoding provides new opportunities. Its potential to accurately identify invertebrates in bulk samples to the species level. has been demonstrated in several case studies. However. DNA based identification is often limited by primer bias. potentially leading to taxa in the sample remaining undetected. Thus. the success of DNA metabarcoding as an emerging technique for bioassessment critically relies on carefully evaluating primers. We used the R package PrimerMiner to obtain and process cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequence data for the 15 most globally relevant freshwater invertebrate groups for stream assessment. Using these sequence alignments. we developed four primer combinations optimized for freshwater macrozoobenthos. All primers were evaluated by sequencing ten mock community samples. each consisting of 52 freshwater invertebrate taxa. Additionally. popular metabarcoding primers from the literature and the developed primers were tested in silico against the 15 relevant invertebrate groups. The developed primers varied in amplification efficiency and the number of detected taxa. yet all detected more taxa than standard ‘Folmer’ barcoding primers.

However. few large‐scale studies have compared the performance of DNA metabarcoding with that of routine morphological identification. We performed metabarcoding using four primer sets on macroinvertebrate samples from 18 stream sites across Finland. The samples were collected in 2013 and identified based on morphology as part of a Finnish stream monitoring program. Specimens were morphologically classified. following standardised protocols. to the lowest taxonomic level for which identification was feasible in the routine national monitoring.

This can be problematic in DNA metabarcoding and metagenomic high‐throughput sequencing approaches. as large specimens contribute disproportionately high amounts of DNA template. Thus. a few specimens of high biomass will dominate the dataset. potentially leading to smaller specimens remaining undetected. Sorting of samples by specimen size (as a proxy for biomass) and balancing the amounts of tissue used per size fraction should improve detection rates. but this approach has not been systematically tested. Here. we explored the effects of size sorting on taxa detection using two freshwater macroinvertebrate bulk samples. collected from a low‐mountain stream in Germany.

However. when used for DNA metabarcoding. estimation of taxa abundances and species detection are limited due to primer bias caused by highly variable primer binding sites across the COI gene. Therefore. we explored the ability of the 16S ribosomal DNA gene as an alternative metabarcoding marker for species level assessments. Ten bulk samples. each containing equal amounts of tissue from 52 freshwater invertebrate taxa. were sequenced with the Illumina NextSeq 500 system. The 16S primers amplified three more insect species than the Folmer COI primers and amplified more equally. probably due to decreased primer bias. Estimation of biomass might be less biased with 16S than with COI. although variation in read abundances of two orders of magnitudes is still observed. According to these results. the marker choice depends on the scientific question. If the goal is to obtain a taxonomic identification at the species level. then COI is more appropriate due to established reference databases and known taxonomic resolution of this marker. knowing that a greater proportion of insects will be missed using COI Folmer primers.

However. sequencing errors in high-throughput sequencing instruments are fairly common. usually requiring reads to be clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). losing information on intraspecific diversity in the process. While Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotype information is limited in resolving intraspecific diversity it is nevertheless often useful e.g. in a phylogeographic context. helping to formulate hypotheses on taxon distribution and dispersal.This study combines sequence denoising strategies. normally applied in microbial research. with additional abundance-based filtering to extract haplotype information from freshwater macroinvertebrate metabarcoding datasets. This novel approach was added to the R package “JAMP” and can be applied to COI amplicon datasets. We tested our haplotyping method by sequencing (i) a single-species mock community composed of 31 individuals with 15 different haplotypes spanning three orders of magnitude in biomass and (ii) 18 monitoring samples each amplified with four different primer sets and two PCR replicates.We detected all 15 haplotypes of the single specimens in the mock community with relaxed filtering and denoising settings.

The fwh1 primer sets showed the most consistent amplification in silico and in vitro. detecting 92% of the taxa present in the mock communities. and allowing clear differentiation between the three macroinvertebrate communities from the Romanian streams. In silico analysis indicates that the short primers are likely to perform well even for non-freshwater insects. Comparing the performance of the new fwh1 primer sets to a highly degenerate primer set targeting a longer fragment (BF2+ BR2) revealed that detection efficiency is slightly lower for the new primer set. Nevertheless. the shorter new primer pairs might be useful for studies that have to rely on degraded or poorly conserved DNA and thus be of importance for …,True,L3dDk-IAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,41,https://peerj.com/preprints/3037.pdf,6359015694653404868,/scholar?cites=6359015694653404868,,https://peerj.com/preprints/3037.pdf,0,0,0
1157204,Scaling up DNA metabarcoding for freshwater macrozoobenthos monitoring,2018,Vasco Elbrecht and Dirk Steinke,,Freshwater Biology,,1-8,,  The viability of DNA metabarcoding for assessment of freshwater macrozoobenthos has been demonstrated over the recent years. The method has matured to a stage where it can be applied to monitoring at a large scale. keeping pace with increased high‐throughput sequencing capacity. However. workflows and sample tagging need to be optimised to accommodate for hundreds of samples within a single sequencing run. Here. we conceptualise a streamlined metabarcoding workflow. in which samples are processed in 96‐well plates. Each sample is replicated starting with tissue extraction. Negative and positive controls are included to ensure data reliability. With our newly developed fusion primer sets for the BF2 + BR2 primer pair up to three 96‐well plates (288 wells) can be uniquely tagged for a single Illumina sequencing run.

However. it is essential to use primer sets that minimize amplification bias among taxa to maximize species recovery. Despite this fact. the performance of primer sets employed for metabarcoding terrestrial arthropods has not been sufficiently evaluated. This study tests the performance of 36 primer sets on a mock community containing 374 insect species. Amplification success was assessed with gradient PCRs and the 21 most promising primer sets selected for metabarcoding. These 21 primer sets were also tested by metabarcoding a Malaise trap sample. We identified eight primer sets. mainly those including inosine and/or high degeneracy. that recovered more than 95% of the species in the mock community. Results from the Malaise trap sample were congruent with the mock community. but primer sets generating short amplicons produced potential false positives. Taxon recovery from both mock community and Malaise trap sample metabarcoding were used to select four primer sets for additional evaluation at different annealing temperatures (40–60 °C) using the mock community. The effect of temperature varied by primer pair but overall it only had a minor effect on taxon recovery. This study reveals the weak performance of some primer sets employed in past studies. It also demonstrates that certain primer sets can recover most taxa in a diverse species assemblage. Thus. based our experimental set up. there is no need to employ several primer sets targeting the same gene region.

This progress has culminated in molecular monitoring methods being employed for the detection of several species for enforceable management purposes of endangered. invasive. and illegally harvested species worldwide. However. the routine application of DNA-based methods to monitor whole communities (typically a metabarcoding approach) in order to assess the status of ecosystems continues to be limited. In aquatic ecosystems. the limited use is particularly true for macroinvertebrate communities. As part of the DNAqua-Net consortium. a structured discussion was initiated with the aim to identify potential molecular methods for freshwater macroinvertebrate community assessment and identify important knowledge gaps for their routine application. We focus on three complementary DNA sources that can be metabarcoded: 1) DNA from homogenised samples (bulk DNA). 2) DNA extracted from sample preservative (fixative DNA). and 3) environmental DNA (eDNA) from water or sediment. We provide a brief overview of metabarcoding macroinvertebrate communities from each DNA source and identify challenges for their application to routine monitoring. To advance the utilisation of DNA-based monitoring for macroinvertebrates. we propose an experimental design template for a series of methodological calibration tests.

Even though Bti is considered environmentally friendly. several studies have shown non-target effects on chironomids. a key food resource in wetland ecosystems. Chironomids have been proposed as important indicators for monitoring freshwater ecosystems. however. morphological determination is very challenging. In this study. we investigated the effectiveness of metabarcoding for chironomid diversity assessment and tested the retrieved chironomid operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for possible changes in relative abundance and species diversity in relation to mosquito control actions in four temporary wetlands. Three of these wetlands were. for the first year after 20 years of Bti treatment. partly left Bti-untreated in a split field design. and one wetland has never been treated with Bti. Our metabarcoding approach detected 54 chironomid OTUs across all study sites. of which almost 70% could be identified to species level comparisons against the BOLD database. We showed that metabarcoding increased chironomid species determination by 70%. However. we found only minor significant effects of Bti on the chironomid community composition. even though Bti reduced chironomid emergence by 65%. This could be due to a time lag of chironomid recolonization. since the study year was the first year of Bti intermittence after about 20 years of Bti application in the study area.

However. in metabarcoding. it is often difficult to avoid primer degeneracy in order to maximize taxa detection. We here investigate primer binding specificity using different primer sets from several invertebrate metabarcoding studies. Our results indicate that primers frequently bound 1-2 bp upstream in taxa where a homopolymer region was present in the amplification direction. Primer binding 1 bp downstream was observed less frequently. This primer slippage leads to taxon-specific length variation in amplicons and subsequent length variation in recovered sequences. Some widely used primer sets were severely affected by this bias. while others were not.

1157217,Phenotypic plasticity: beyond nature and nurture,2001,Massimo Pigliucci,,,,,JHU Press,For more than two decades the concept of phenotypic plasticity has allowed researchers to go beyond the nature-nurture dichotomy to gain deeper insights into how organisms are shaped by the interaction of genetic and ecological factors. Phenotypic Plasticity: Beyond Nature and Nurture is the first work to synthesize the burgeoning area of plasticity studies. providing a conceptual overview as well as a technical treatment of its major components. Phenotypic plasticity integrates the insights of ecological genetics. developmental biology. and evolutionary theory. Plasticity research asks foundational questions about how living organisms are capable of variation in their genetic makeup and in their responses to environmental factors. For instance. how do novel adaptive phenotypes originate? How do organisms detect and respond to stressful environments? What is the balance between genetic or natural constraints (such as gravity) and natural selection? The author begins by defining phenotypic plasticity and detailing its history. including important experiments and methods of statistical and graphical analysis. He then provides extended examples of the molecular basis of plasticity. the plasticity of development. the ecology of plastic responses. and the role of costs and constraints in the evolution of plasticity. A brief epilogue looks at how plasticity studies shed light on the nature/nurture debate in the popular media.

Yet research on the inducible defenses used by vertebrates. invertebrates. and plants in terrestrial. marine. and freshwater habitats has largely developed along independent lines. Ralph Tollrian and Drew Harvell seek to change that here. By bringing together leading researchers from all fields to review common themes and explore emerging ideas. this book represents the most current and comprehensive survey of knowledge about the ecology and evolution of inducible defenses. Contributors examine organisms as different as unicellular algae and higher vertebrates. and consider defenses ranging from immune systems to protective changes in morphology. behavior. chemistry. and life history. The authors of the review chapters. case studies. and theoretical studies pinpoint unifying factors favoring the evolution of inducible defenses. Throughout. the volume emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach. integrating applied and theoretical ecology. evolution. genetics. and chemistry. In addition.

1157221,Predator functional responses: discriminating between handling and digesting prey,2002,Jonathan M Jeschke and Michael Kopp and Ralph Tollrian,72,,1,95-112,Ecological Society of America,We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e.. attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model. we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e.. searching and handling). Instead. we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally. our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state. we term it the steady state satiation (SSS) equation.The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e.. asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time. for prey density approaching infinity).

Juveniles of D. pulex produce morphological changes (""neckteeth"") and undergo life history shifts as defenses against predatory Chaoborus (phantom midge) larvae. These traits are induced by a chemical cue (kairomone) released by the predator.

Several species change morphology. life history. and behavior in response to chemical cues released by predators. Chaoborids. notonectids. and fish are reported to induce specific defenses. In this review we pinpoint five factors that favor the evolution of inducible defenses in Cladocera:(1) Each of the predators can have a strong. but seasonally variable impact on zooplankton communities. During part of the year the predators have no. or a very low impact.(2) Many of the defenses are induced by chemical cues released by the predators. These chemical cues are specific and allow for formation of defenses in response to the actual risk of predation. Chemical cues are good and reliable signals in aquatic environments. Mechanical or visual signals are for inducing escape reactions.(3) Cladocerans can form effective defenses against many predators within their developmental and environmental constraints. Prey body size in relation to the predator's size selectivity is a key factor for the evolution of different types of defense mechanisms in different species.(4) For many of the defenses. costs are reported. which can be saved when the defense is not formed. Often tradeoffs are not necessarily direct allocation costs for the formation of the defensive trait. but rather result from interactions of the defense with the environment (environmental costs).(5) Cladocerans often coexist with several predator species. each with a different prey selectivity. Thus. modifying a trait in response to one predator can subsequently increase vulnerability to other predators.

A functional response is said to be of type I if consumption rate increases linearly with food abundance up to a threshold level at which it remains constant. According to conventional wisdom. such type I responses are more frequent among filter feeders than among other consumers. However. the validity of this claim has never been tested. We review 814 functional responses from 235 studies. thereby showing that type I responses are not only exceptionally frequent among filter feeders but that they have only been reported from these consumers.These findings can be understood by considering the conditions that a consumer must fulfil in order to show a type I response.

On the basis of these changes. a scoring method is presented that allows easy classification of the morphological changes.

At its extreme. the answers give us insight into what is perhaps our greatest medical problem: the evolution of inducible resistance to disease and its sometimes disastrous failure. Recent tabulations indicate that inducible defenses are widespread and occur in many invertebrate groups. in vertebrates. and in plants. In invertebrates and vertebrates. defensive shifts in morphology. life history. and behavior are induced by proximity to predators and competitors. In insects. antibacterial cecropins are induced by pathogens. In vertebrates. selective induction of multiple mechanisms of resistance in the immune system is perhaps the most striking example in any organism of precision in tracking biotic agents.

Previous studies. however. indicated the existence of several genetically and morphologically divergent lineages. questioning the assumption of its cosmopolitan and eurybathic distribution. For the first time. its genetic diversity was explored at the global scale (Arctic. Atlantic. Pacific and Southern oceans) by analyzing nuclear (28S rDNA) and mitochondrial (COI. 16S rDNA) sequence data using various species delimitation methods in a phylogeographic context. Nine putative species-level clades were identified within E. gryllus. A clear distinction was observed between samples collected at bathyal versus abyssal depths. with a genetic break occurring around 3.000 m. Two bathyal and two abyssal lineages showed a widespread distribution. while five other abyssal lineages each seemed to be restricted to a single ocean basin. The observed higher diversity in the abyss compared to the bathyal zone stands in contrast to the depth-differentiation hypothesis. Our results indicate that. despite the more uniform environment of the abyss and its presumed lack of obvious isolating barriers. abyssal populations might be more likely to show population differentiation and undergo speciation events than previously assumed.

However. the growing evidence for cryptic and pseudo-cryptic speciation has emphasized the need of re-evaluating the status of copepod species complexes in molecular and morphological studies to get a clearer picture about pelagic marine species as evolutionary units and their distributions. This study analyses the molecular diversity of the ecologically important Paracalanus parvus species complex. Its seven currently recognized species are abundant and also often dominant in marine coastal regions worldwide from temperate to tropical oceans. COI and Cytochrome b sequences of 160 specimens of the Paracalanus parvus complex from all oceans were obtained. Furthermore. 42 COI sequences from GenBank were added for the genetic analyses. Thirteen distinct molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) and two single sequences were revealed with cladistic analyses (Maximum Likelihood. Bayesian Inference). of which seven were identical with results from species delimitation methods (barcode gaps. ABDG. GMYC. Rosenberg’s P(AB)). In total. 10 to 12 putative species were detected and could be placed in three categories: (1) temperate geographically isolated. (2) warm-temperate to tropical wider spread and (3) circumglobal warm-water species. The present study provides evidence of cryptic or pseudocryptic speciation in the Paracalanus parvus complex.

Most marine species in Falkland waters are also reported from southern Patagonia. It remains unclear if relatively immobile. marine benthic. shallow-water species maintain gene flow. and by what mechanism. Recurrent fluctuations in sea level during glacial cycles are regarded as a possible mechanism that might have allowed genetic exchange between the regions. However. the realized genetic exchange between the Falkland Islands and Patagonia has never been estimated. This study analyses the genetic structure of three populations of the marine shallow-water isopod Serolis paradoxa (Fabricius. 1775) from the Falkland Islands and southern Patagonia (central Strait of Magellan and the Atlantic opening) applying seven nuclear microsatellites and a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Both marker systems report highest genetic diversity for the population from the central Strait of Magellan and lowest for the Falkland Islands. The estimated effective population sizes were large for all populations studied. Significant differentiation was observed among all three populations. The magnitude of differentiation between Patagonia and the Falkland Islands (16S: uncorrected p-distance 2.1%; microsatellites: standardized F'ST > 0.86) was an order of magnitude higher than between populations from within Patagonia. This indicates that there is currently no effective gene flow for nominal S. paradoxa between these two regions and it has been absent for time exceeding the last glacial maximum.

We here apply the five criteria of Eastman and McCune for detecting species flocks in four taxonomic components of the benthic fauna of the Antarctic shelf: teleost fishes. crinoids (feather stars). echinoids (sea urchins) and crustacean arthropods. Practical limitations led us to prioritize the three historical criteria (endemicity. monophyly. species richness) over the two ecological ones (ecological diversity and habitat dominance). We propose a new protocol which includes an iterative fine-tuning of the monophyly and endemicity criteria in order to discover unsuspected flocks. As a result nine « full » species flocks (fulfilling the five criteria) are briefly described. Eight other flocks fit the three historical criteria but need to be further investigated from the ecological point of view (here called « core flocks »). The approach also shows that some candidate taxonomic components are no species flocks at all. The present study contradicts the paradigm that marine species flocks are rare. The hypothesis according to which the Antarctic shelf acts as a species flocks generator is supported. and the approach indicates paths for further ecological studies and may serve as a starting point to investigate the processes leading to flock-like patterning of biodiversity.,True,y5cBeNAAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,58,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068787,15953739960169218907,/scholar?cites=15953739960169218907,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068787,0,0,0

1157259,The utility of fast evolving molecular markers for studying speciation in the Antarctic benthos,2007,Christoph Held and Florian Leese,30,Polar Biology,4,513-521,Springer-Verlag,The Southern Ocean is surprisingly rich in species that coexist in one of the most extreme environments on Earth yet the processes leading to speciation in this ecosystem are not well understood. To remedy this. tools that measure the genetic connectedness within a species are needed. Although useful for phylogenetic purposes. the readily available mitochondrial markers (e.g. 16S. COI) suffer from numerous shortcomings for population genetics. Therefore. molecular markers are needed that are sufficiently variable. unlinked. biparentally inherited. and distributed over the whole genome.

The sequence coverage is nearly complete for four of the five newly sequenced species. with only the control region and some tRNA genes missing. while in Janira maculosa only two thirds of the genome could be determined. Mitochondrial gene order in isopods seems to be more plastic than that in other crustacean lineages. making all nine known mt gene orders different. Especially the asellote Janira is characterized by many autapomorphies.

This progress has culminated in molecular monitoring methods being employed for the detection of several species for enforceable management purposes of endangered. invasive. and illegally harvested species worldwide. However. the routine application of DNA-based methods to monitor whole communities (typically a metabarcoding approach) in order to assess the status of ecosystems continues to be limited. In aquatic ecosystems. the limited use is particularly true for macroinvertebrate communities. As part of the DNAqua-Net consortium. a structured discussion was initiated with the aim to identify potential molecular methods for freshwater macroinvertebrate community assessment and identify important knowledge gaps for their routine application. We focus on three complementary DNA sources that can be metabarcoded: 1) DNA from homogenised samples (bulk DNA). 2) DNA extracted from sample preservative (fixative DNA). and 3) environmental DNA (eDNA) from water or sediment. We provide a brief overview of metabarcoding macroinvertebrate communities from each DNA source and identify challenges for their application to routine monitoring.

1157278,A DNA metabarcoding protocol for hyporheic freshwater meiofauna: Evaluating highly degenerate COI primers and replication strategy,2018,Alexander M Weigand and Jan-Niklas Macher,2,Metabarcoding and Metagenomics,,e26869,Pensoft Publishers,The hyporheic zone. ie the ecotone between surface water and the groundwater. is a rarely studied freshwater ecosystem. Hyporheic taxa are often meiofaunal (< 1 mm) in size and difficult to identify based on morphology. Metabarcoding approaches are promising for the study of these environments and taxa. but it is yet unclear if commonly applied metabarcoding primers and replication strategies can be used. In this study. we took sediment cores from two near natural upstream (NNU) and two ecologically improved downstream (EID) sites in the Boye catchment (Emscher River. Germany). metabarcoding their meiofaunal communities. We evaluated the usability of a commonly used. highly degenerate COI primer pair (BF2/BR2) and tested how sequencing three PCR replicates per sample and removing MOTUs present in only one out of three replicates impacts the inferred community composition. A total of 22.514 MOTUs were detected. of which only 263 were identified as Metazoa. Our results highlight the gaps in reference databases for meiofaunal taxa and the potential problems of using highly degenerate primers for studying samples containing a high number of non-metazoan taxa. Alpha diversity was higher in EID sites and showed higher community similarity when compared to NNU sites. Beta diversity analyses showed that removing MOTUs detected in only one out of three replicates per site greatly increased community similarity in samples. Sequencing three sample replicates and removing rare MOTUs is seen as a good compromise between retaining too many false-positives and introducing too many false-negatives.

However. it suffers from PCR bias. which can lead to the loss of specific taxa.

To decrease these high extinction rates. ecological restorations are increasingly applied to restore and maintain the good ecological status of freshwaters. Their ecological status can be determined by assessing the presence of indicator species (e.g. certain fish species). which is called biomonitoring. However. traditional biomonitoring of fish. such as electrofishing. is often challenging and invasive. To augment traditional biomonitoring of fish. the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently been proposed as an alternative. sensitive approach. The present study employed this modern approach to monitor the Rhine sculpin (Cottus rhenanus). a fish species that has been reintroduced into a recently restored stream within the Emscher catchment in Germany. in order to validate the success of the applied restorations. We monitored the dispersal of the Rhine sculpin using replicated 12S end-point PCR eDNA surveillance at a fine spatial and temporal scale. In that way. we investigated if eDNA analysis can be applied for freshwater assessments. We also performed traditional electrofishing in one instance to validate our eDNA-based approach. We could track the dispersal of the Rhine sculpin and showed a higher dispersal potential of the species than we assumed. We validated the species’ dispersal across a potential dispersal barrier via eDNA detection and showed a steep increase of positive detections once the reintroduced population had established.

Abiotic factors in rivers can change on small spatial and temporal scale and might greatly influence eDNA metabarcoding results. In this study. we sampled three German rivers at four locations per sampling site: 1. Left river side. surface water 2. Right river side. surface water. 3. Left side. close to the riverbed. 4. Right side. close to the riverbed. For the rivers Ruhr and Möhne. sampling was conducted three times in spring. each sampling one week apart. The Ruhr was again sampled in autumn and the Gillbach was sampled in winter. Sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq with degenerate COI primers Bf2/BR2 revealed diverse communities (6493 Operational taxonomic units. OTUs). which largely differed between rivers. Communities changed significantly over time in the Ruhr. but not in the Möhne. Sampling location influenced recovered communities in the Möhne and in the Ruhr in autumn.

Species identification is often complex. as both morphological and molecular approaches can be challenging due to a lack of unique characters and reference sequences. An integrative approach combining state of the art morphological and molecular tools is therefore promising. In this study. we analysed large benthic Foraminifera of the genus Amphisorus from Western Australia and Indonesia. Based on previous findings on high morphological variability observed in the Soritidae and the discontinuous distribution of Amphisorus along the coast of western Australia. we expected to find multiple morphologically and genetically unique Amphisorus types. In order to gain detailed insights into the diversity of Amphisorus. we applied micro CT scanning and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We identified four distinct morphotypes of Amphisorus. two each in Australia and Indonesia. and showed that each morphotype is a distinct genotype. Furthermore. metagenomics revealed the presence of three dinoflagellate symbiont clades. The most common symbiont was Fugacium Fr5. and we could show that its genotypes were mostly specific to Amphisorus morphotypes. Finally. we assembled the microbial taxa associated with the two Western Australian morphotypes. and analysed their microbial community composition.

The high abundance and high taxonomic diversity renders zooplankton ideal for biodiversity monitoring. However. taxonomic identification of the zooplankton assemblage is challenging due to its high diversity. subtle morphological differences and the presence of many meroplanktonic species. especially in coastal seas. Molecular techniques such as metabarcoding can help with rapid processing and identification of taxa in complex samples. and are therefore promising tools for identifying zooplankton communities. In this study. we applied metabarcoding of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene to zooplankton samples collected along a latitudinal transect in the North Sea. a shelf sea of the Atlantic Ocean. Northern regions of the North Sea are influenced by inflow of oceanic Atlantic waters. whereas the southern parts are characterised by more coastal waters. Our metabarcoding results indicated strong differences in zooplankton community composition between northern and southern areas of the North Sea. particularly in the classes Copepoda.

The study was randomized. Organic bananas selected for the study were visibly inspected to ensure the fruit was unripen with no visible signs of bruising. spotting. or infection from a local distributor. Four trials were conducted from June 5th - August 5th 2014 with 3 replicates (3-4 bananas per experimental unit) in 4 trial studies for 3 days at room temperature. A mixed culture of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were collected from soil surrounding the roots of young fruit bearing trees. Microbes were mixed with no-carbon source media. and cultured with an ethylene for 3 d at room temperature in a closed container. Induced soil was used to delay ripening. Microbes induced with media and ethylene delayed ripening 100% of the time in all experimental units compared to control samples. while microbes cultured with media (no ethylene) delayed ripening less than 10% of the time compared to the control. These cells also appeared to increase the incidence of fungal infection in the fruit. The findings suggest induced microbes may convert ethylene into ethanol then acetaldehyde. The two compounds may form an acetaldehyde/ethanol vapor that delays ripening. and a secondary nitrile compound that inhibits fungal growth.,True,rZwMbmMAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC,0,https://peerj.com/preprints/506,,,,https://peerj.com/preprints/506.pdf,0,0,0

Current methods for estimating best-fit partitioning schemes. however. are only computationally feasible with datasets of fewer than 100 loci. This is a problem because datasets with thousands of loci are increasingly common in phylogenetics. We develop two novel methods for estimating best-fit partitioning schemes on large phylogenomic datasets: strict and relaxed hierarchical clustering. These methods use information from the underlying data to cluster together similar subsets of sites in an alignment. and build on clustering approaches that have been proposed elsewhere. We compare the performance of our methods to each other. and to existing methods for selecting partitioning schemes. We demonstrate that while strict hierarchical clustering has the best computational efficiency on very large datasets. relaxed hierarchical clustering provides scalable efficiency and returns dramatically better partitioning schemes as assessed by common criteria such as AICc and BIC scores. These two methods provide the best current approaches to inferring partitioning schemes for very large datasets. We provide free open-source implementations of the methods in the PartitionFinder software. We hope that the use of these methods will help to improve the inferences made from large phylogenomic datasets.,True,PNSjueAAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,461,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-14-82,17035797331280961823,/scholar?cites=17035797331280961823,,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-14-82,0,0,0

1157302,Visualizing differences in phylogenetic information content of alignments and distinction of three classes of long-branch effects,2007,Johann W Wägele and Christoph Mayer,7,BMC Evolutionary Biology,1,147,BioMed Central Ltd,Published molecular phylogenies are usually based on data whose quality has not been explored prior to tree inference. This leads to errors because trees obtained with conventional methods suppress conflicting evidence. and because support values may be high even if there is no distinct phylogenetic signal. Tools that allow an a priori examination of data quality are rarely applied. Using data from published molecular analyses on the phylogeny of crustaceans it is shown that tree topologies and popular support values do not show existing differences in data quality. To visualize variations in signal distinctness. we use network analyses based on split decomposition and split support spectra. Both methods show the same differences in data quality and the same clade-supporting patterns. Both methods are useful to discover long-branch effects. We discern three classes of long branch effects. Class I effects consist of attraction of terminal taxa caused by symplesiomorphies. which results in a false monophyly of paraphyletic groups. Addition of carefully selected taxa can fix this effect. Class II effects are caused by drastic signal erosion. Long branches affected by this phenomenon usually slip down the tree to form false clades that in reality are polyphyletic. To recover the correct phylogeny. more conservative genes must be used. Class III effects consist of attraction due to accumulated chance similarities or convergent character states. This sort of noise can be reduced by selecting less variable portions of the data set. avoiding biases. and adding slower genes.

Mixture models and partitioning are commonly used to account for this variation. and partitioning is the most popular approach. Most current partitioning methods require some a priori partitioning scheme to be defined. typically guided by known structural features of the sequences. such as gene boundaries or codon positions. Recent evidence suggests that these a priori boundaries often fail to adequately account for variation in rates and patterns of evolution among sites. Furthermore. new phylogenomic datasets such as those assembled from ultra-conserved elements lack obvious structural features on which to define a priori partitioning schemes. The upshot is that. for many phylogenetic datasets. partitioned models of molecular evolution may be inadequate. thus limiting the accuracy of downstream phylogenetic analyses. We present a new algorithm that automatically selects a partitioning scheme via the iterative division of the alignment into subsets of similar sites based on their rates of evolution. We compare this method to existing approaches using a wide range of empirical datasets. and show that it consistently leads to large increases in the fit of partitioned models of molecular evolution when measured using AICc and BIC scores. In doing so. we demonstrate that some related approaches to solving this problem may have been associated with a small but important bias.

For various genomes. the densities of short TR types were shown to differ strongly among different taxa and genomic regions. In this study we analysed the TR characteristics in the genomes of Daphnia pulex and 11 other eukaryotic species. Characteristics of TRs in different genomic regions and among different strands are compared in details for D. pulex and the two model insects Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster. Profound differences in TR characteristics were found among all 12 genomes compared in this study. In D. pulex. the genomic density of TRs was low compared to the arthropod species D. melanogaster and A. mellifera.

We simulated data of different alignment lengths under two different 11-taxon trees and a broad range of different branch length conditions. The data were analyzed with the true model parameters as well as with estimated and incorrect assumptions about among-site rate variation. If length differences between connected branches strongly increase. tree inference with the correct likelihood model assumptions can fail. We found that incorporating invariant sites together with  distributed site rates in the tree reconstruction (+I) increases the robustness of maximum likelihood in comparison with models using only . The results show that for some topologies and branch lengths the reconstruction success of maximum likelihood under the correct model is still low for alignments with a length of 100.000 base positions.

Major problems for our understanding of the evolutionary history of Apoidea have been the difficulty to trace the phylogenetic origin and to reliably estimate the geological age of bees. To address these issues. we compiled a comprehensive phylogenomic dataset by simultaneously analyzing target DNA enrichment and transcriptomic sequence data. comprising 195 single-copy protein-coding genes and covering all major lineages of apoid wasps and bee families. Our compiled data matrix comprised 284.607 nucleotide sites that we phylogenetically analyzed by applying a combination of domain- and codon-based partitioning schemes.

However. different phylogenetic trees often contain conflicting results and contradict significant background data. Not knowing how reliable traditional knowledge is. a crucial question concerns the quality of newly produced molecular data. The information content of DNA alignments is rarely discussed. as quality statements are mostly restricted to the statistical support of clades. Here we present a case study of a recently published mollusk phylogeny that contains surprising groupings. based on five genes and 108 species. and we apply new or rarely used tools for the analysis of the information content of alignments and for the filtering of noise (masking of random-like alignment regions. split decomposition. phylogenetic networks. quartet mapping).

We show that that signal-like patterns in the data set are conflicting and partly not distinct and that the reported strong support for a ""rather surprising result"" (monoplacophorans and chitons form a monophylum Serialia) does not exist at the level of primary homologies. Split-decomposition. quartet mapping and neighbornet analyses reveal conflicting nucleotide patterns and lack of distinct phylogenetic signal for the deeper phylogeny of mollusks.

Molecular tools have shown many freshwater taxa to comprise morphologically cryptic species. which often occur in sympatry on a small geographic scale. Here. we studied the freshwater snail Ancylus fluviatilis (Müller. 1774) species complex in the Iberian Montseny Mountains. We hypothesized that (1) several species of A. fluviatilis sensu lato occur in the Montseny and (2) the different species seldom co-occur in syntopy due to different ecological demands or interspecific competition.

To decrease these high extinction rates. ecological restorations are increasingly applied to restore and maintain the good ecological status of freshwaters. Their ecological status can be determined by assessing the presence of indicator species (e.g. certain fish species). which is called biomonitoring. However. traditional biomonitoring of fish. such as electrofishing. is often challenging and invasive. To augment traditional biomonitoring of fish. the analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently been proposed as an alternative. sensitive approach. The present study employed this modern approach to monitor the Rhine sculpin (Cottus rhenanus). a fish species that has been reintroduced into a recently restored stream within the Emscher catchment in Germany. in order to validate the success of the applied restorations. We monitored the dispersal of the Rhine sculpin using replicated 12S end-point PCR eDNA surveillance at a fine spatial and temporal scale. In that way. we investigated if eDNA analysis can be applied for freshwater assessments. We also performed traditional electrofishing in one instance to validate our eDNA-based approach. We could track the dispersal of the Rhine sculpin and showed a higher dispersal potential of the species than we assumed. We validated the species’ dispersal across a potential dispersal barrier via eDNA detection and showed a steep increase of positive detections once the reintroduced population had established. In contrast to that. false negative eDNA results occurred at early reintroduction …,True,pAzdVYgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,4,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2020.00081/full?&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_Evolution&id=497255,3884059885948031860,/scholar?cites=3884059885948031860,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2020.00081/full?&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Ecology_and_Evolution&id=497255,0,0,0

For an efficient conservation. comprehensive monitoring and assessment of all ecosystem elements is of fundamental importance. The Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission HELCOM coordinates conservation measures regulated by several European directives. However. this holistic assessment is hindered by gaps within the current monitoring schemes. Here. twenty-two novel methods with the potential to fill some of these gaps and improve the monitoring of the Baltic marine environment are examined. We asked key stakeholders to point out methods likely to improve current Baltic Sea monitoring. We then described these methods in a comparable way and evaluated them based on their costs and applicability potential (i.e. possibility to make them operational). Twelve methods require low to very low costs. while five require moderate and two high costs. Seventeen methods were rated with a high to very high applicability. whereas four methods had moderate and one low applicability for Baltic Sea monitoring. Methods with both low costs and a high applicability include the Manta Trawl. Encapsulated Filtration Device. Sediment Corer. Argo Float. Artificial Substrates. Citizen Observation.

Most bioassessments apply the taxonomic sufficiency concept and assign specimens to the family or genus level given time constraints and the difficulty to correctly identify species. This holds particularly true for stream invertebrates because small and morphologically similar larvae are hard to distinguish. Low taxonomic resolution may hinder detecting true community dynamics. which thus leads to incorrect inferences about community assembly processes. DNA metabarcoding is a new. affordable and cost-effective tool for the identification of multiple species from bulk samples of organisms. As it provides high taxonomic resolution. it can be used to compare results obtained from different identification levels. Measuring the effect of taxonomic resolution on the detection of community dynamics is especially interesting in extreme ecosystems like intermittent streams to test if species at intermittent sites are subsets of those from perennial sources or if independently recruiting taxa exist. Here we aimed to compare the performance of morphological identification and metabarcoding to detect macroinvertebrate community dynamics in the Trebbia River (Italy). Macroinvertebrates were collected from four perennial and two intermittent sites two months after flow resumption and before the next dry phase. The identification level ranged from family to haplotype. Metabarcoding and morphological identifications found similar alpha diversity patterns when looking at family and mixed taxonomic levels.

The study was randomized. Organic bananas selected for the study were visibly inspected to ensure the fruit was unripen with no visible signs of bruising. spotting. or infection from a local distributor. Four trials were conducted from June 5th - August 5th 2014 with 3 replicates (3-4 bananas per experimental unit) in 4 trial studies for 3 days at room temperature. A mixed culture of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were collected from soil surrounding the roots of young fruit bearing trees. Microbes were mixed with no-carbon source media. and cultured with an ethylene for 3 d at room temperature in a closed container. Induced soil was used to delay ripening. Microbes induced with media and ethylene delayed ripening 100% of the time in all experimental units compared to control samples. while microbes cultured with media (no ethylene) delayed ripening less than 10% of the time compared to the control. These cells also appeared to increase the incidence of fungal infection in the fruit. The findings suggest induced microbes may convert ethylene into ethanol then acetaldehyde. The two compounds may form an acetaldehyde/ethanol vapor that delays ripening. and a secondary nitrile compound that inhibits fungal growth.,True,pAzdVYgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://peerj.com/preprints/506,,,,https://peerj.com/preprints/506.pdf,0,0,0

In order to monitor the impacts that stressors have on freshwater biodiversity. it is important to know the current state of ecosystems and species living in them. This is often hampered by lacking knowledge on species and genetic diversity due to the fact that many taxa are complexes of several morphologically cryptic species. Lacking knowledge on species identity and ecology can lead to wrong biodiversity and stream quality assessments and molecular tools can greatly help resolving this problem. Here. we studied larvae of the caddisfly family Sericostomatidae in the Montseny mountains on the Iberian Peninsula. We expected to find cryptic species and that species would not occur in syntopy due to different ecological niches. We sampled 44 stream sites and sequenced 247 larval specimens for the barcoding region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene. A modeling approach was used to assess the bioclimatic preferences of the found species. Two molecular groups were identified. One could be assigned to Schizopelex furcifera and one to Sericostoma spp. We did find both taxa in syntopy in >50% of sampling sites and could show that the taxa prefer similar bioclimatic conditions. A reexamination of larval specimens showed that Sericostoma and Schizopelex larvae could not be unambiguously identified to the genus level.

In order to assess the ecological status of a given water body. aquatic biodiversity data are obtained and compared to a reference water body. The quantified mismatch obtained determines the extent of potential management actions. The current approach to biodiversity assessment is based on morpho-taxonomy.

This clade comprises several groups that invaded the land realm independently and in different time periods. e.g.. Ellobioidea. Systellomatophora. and Stylommatophora. Thus. mitochondrial genomes of panpulmonate gastropods are promising to screen for adaptive molecular signatures related to land invasions. We obtained three complete mitochondrial genomes of terrestrial panpulmonates. i.e.. the ellobiid Carychium tridentatum. and the stylommatophorans Arion rufus and Helicella itala. Our dataset consisted of 50 mitogenomes comprising almost all major panpulmonate lineages. The phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genes supports the monophyly of the clade Panpulmonata. Terrestrial lineages were sampled from Ellobioidea (1 sp.) and Stylommatophora (9 spp.). The branch-site test of positive selection detected significant non-synonymous changes in the terrestrial branches leading to Carychium (Ellobiodea) and Stylommatophora. These convergent changes occurred in the cob and nad5 genes (OXPHOS complex III and I. respectively). The convergence of the non-synonymous changes in cob and nad5 suggest possible ancient episodes of positive selection related to adaptations to non-marine habitats.

In our study. we tested these hypotheses for two widespread. sympatric microgastropod taxa – Carychium minimum O.F. Müller. 1774 and Carychium tridentatum (Risso. 1826) (Gastropoda. Eupulmonata. Carychiidae) – by using COI sequence data and species potential distribution models analyzed in a statistical phylogeographical framework. Additionally. we examined disjunct transatlantic populations of those taxa from the Azores and North America. In general. both Carychium taxa demonstrate a genetic structure composed of several differentiated haplotype lineages most likely resulting from allopatric diversification in isolated refugial areas during the Pleistocene glacial periods. However. the genetic structure of Carychium minimum is more pronounced. which can be attributed to ecological constraints relating to habitat proximity to permanent bodies of water. For most of the Carychium lineages. the broader Alpine Region was identified as the likely origin of genetic diversity. Several lineages are endemic to the broader Alpine Region whereas a single lineage per species underwent a postglacial expansion to (re)colonize previously unsuitable habitats. e.g. in Northern Europe. The source populations of those expanding lineages can be traced back to the Eastern and Western Alps.

Hyporheic taxa are often meiofaunal (< 1 mm) in size and difficult to identify based on morphology. Metabarcoding approaches are promising for the study of these environments and taxa. but it is yet unclear if commonly applied metabarcoding primers and replication strategies can be used. In this study. we took sediment cores from two near natural upstream (NNU) and two ecologically improved downstream (EID) sites in the Boye catchment (Emscher River. Germany). metabarcoding their meiofaunal communities. We evaluated the usability of a commonly used. highly degenerate COI primer pair (BF2/BR2) and tested how sequencing three PCR replicates per sample and removing MOTUs present in only one out of three replicates impacts the inferred community composition. A total of 22.514 MOTUs were detected. of which only 263 were identified as Metazoa. Our results highlight the gaps in reference databases for meiofaunal taxa and the potential problems of using highly degenerate primers for studying samples containing a high number of non-metazoan taxa. Alpha diversity was higher in EID sites and showed higher community similarity when compared to NNU sites. Beta diversity analyses showed that removing MOTUs detected in only one out of three replicates per site greatly increased community similarity in samples. Sequencing three sample replicates and removing rare MOTUs is seen as a good compromise between retaining too many false-positives and introducing too many false-negatives.

For example. the radiation of the freshwater crab genus Platythelphusa in Lake Tanganyika is thought to have driven shell diversification of the lake’s snail fauna. promoting the evolution of thalassoid shells. No comparable thalassoid snails are known from Lake Malawi. Accordingly. it was hypothesized that the lake’s only freshwater crab. Potamonautes lirrangensis. is not a snail predator. We tested this hypothesis using feeding experiments with specimens caught in the southern part of Lake Malawi.

Both the mean rate and variability decline with latitude. suggesting temperature constraints toward the poles and greater roles for other environmental drivers (e.g.. nutrient loading) toward the equator. These results and data set the stage for unprecedented “next-generation biomonitoring” by establishing baselines to …,True,AvWVut8AAAAJ:bEWYMUwI8FkC,48,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaav0486?fbclid=IwAR2-Qxvq0PgG97x1OSo-Ix_X_vi35wRyz1dhpEuTg27H2tDYlUo9LevcMMc,5526909017901720839,/scholar?cites=5526909017901720839,,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaav0486?fbclid=IwAR2-Qxvq0PgG97x1OSo-Ix_X_vi35wRyz1dhpEuTg27H2tDYlUo9LevcMMc,0,0,0

Macroinvertebrate biomonitoring is particularly efficient in pinpointing the cause–effect structure between slow and subtle changes and their detrimental consequences in aquatic ecosystems. The greatest obstacle to implementing efficient biomonitoring is currently the cost-intensive human expert taxonomic identification of samples. While there is evidence that automated recognition techniques can match human taxa identification accuracy at greatly reduced costs. so far the development of automated identification techniques for aquatic organisms has been minimal. In this paper. we focus on advancing classification and data retrieval that are instrumental when processing large macroinvertebrate image datasets. To accomplish this for routine biomonitoring. in this paper we shall investigate the feasibility of …,True,AvWVut8AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,40,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482511000795,9613213145450570815,/scholar?cites=9613213145450570815,,,0,0,0

Specifically. rare species may exhibit patterns of diversity variation profoundly different from those of dominant taxa.Location  Southern Finland.Methods  We used multiplicative partitioning of true diversities (species richness. Shannon diversity) to identify the most important scale(s) of variation of benthic macroinvertebrate communities across several hierarchical scales. from individual samples to multiple littorals. lakes and years. We also assessed the among‐scale variability of benthic macroinvertebrate community composition by using measures of between‐ and within‐group distances at hierarchical scales.Results  On average. a single benthic sample contained 23% of the total regional macroinvertebrate species …,True,AvWVut8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,32,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00889.x,9501040413827635709,/scholar?cites=9501040413827635709,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2012.00889.x,0,0,0
