103709,Man-made cell-like compartments for molecular evolution,1998,Dan S Tawfik and Andrew D Griffiths,16,Nature biotechnology,7,652-656,Nature Publishing Group,Cellular compartmentalization is vital for the evolution of all living organisms. Cells keep together the genes. the RNAs and proteins that they encode. and the products of their activities. thus linking genotype to phenotype. We have reproduced this linkage in the test tube by transcribing and translating single genes in the aqueous compartments of water-in-oil emulsions. These compartments. with volumes close to those of bacteria. can be recruited to select genes encoding catalysts. A protein or RNA with a desired catalytic activity converts a substrate attached to the gene that encodes it to product. In other compartments. substrates attached to genes that do not encode catalysts remain unmodified. Subsequently. genes encoding catalysts are selectively enriched by virtue of their linkage to the product. We demonstrate the linkage of genotype to phenotype in man-made compartments using a model system.

This ability is dependent on the induction of new phenotypic traits by a small number of mutations (plasticity). But mutations often have deleterious effects on functions that are essential for survival. How are these seemingly conflicting demands met at the single-protein level? Results from directed laboratory evolution experiments indicate that the evolution of a new function is driven by mutations that have little effect on the native function but large effects on the promiscuous functions that serve as starting point. Thus. an evolving protein can initially acquire increased fitness for a new function without losing its original function.

We consider an alternative. “avant-garde view” in which proteins are conformationally dynamic and exhibit functional promiscuity. We surmise that these properties are the foundation stones of protein evolvability; they facilitate the divergence of new functions within existing folds and the evolution of entirely new folds. Packing modes of proteins also affect their evolvability. and poorly packed. disordered. and conformationally diverse proteins may exhibit high evolvability.

We found that the “average enzyme” exhibits a kcat of ∼10 s–1 and a kcat/KM of ∼105 s–1 M–1. much below the diffusion limit and the characteristic textbook portrayal of kinetically superior enzymes. Why do most enzymes exhibit moderate catalytic efficiencies? Maximal rates may not evolve in cases where weaker selection pressures are expected.

These advances regard (i) the mechanism of catalytic promiscuity — how enzymes. that generally exert exquisite specificity. promiscuously catalyze other. and sometimes barely related. reactions; (ii) the evolvability of promiscuous functions — namely. how latent activities evolve further. and in particular. how promiscuous activities can firstly evolve without severely compromising the original activity.

The accepted paradigm that proteins can tolerate nearly any amino acid substitution has been replaced by the view that the deleterious effects of mutations. and especially their tendency to undermine the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of protein. is a major constraint on protein evolvability—the ability of proteins to acquire changes in sequence and function.

103722,How protein stability and new functions trade off,2008,Nobuhiko Tokuriki and Francois Stricher and Luis Serrano and Dan S Tawfik,4,PLoS Comput Biol,2,e1000002,Public Library of Science,Numerous studies have noted that the evolution of new enzymatic specificities is accompanied by loss of the protein's thermodynamic stability (ΔΔG). thus suggesting a tradeoff between the acquisition of new enzymatic functions and stability. However. since most mutations are destabilizing (ΔΔG>0). one should ask how destabilizing mutations that confer new or altered enzymatic functions relative to all other mutations are. We applied ΔΔG computations by FoldX to analyze the effects of 548 mutations that arose from the directed evolution of 22 different enzymes. The stability effects. location. and type of function-altering mutations were compared to ΔΔG changes arising from all possible point mutations in the same enzymes. We found that mutations that modulate enzymatic functions are mostly destabilizing (average ΔΔG = +0.9 kcal/mol). and are almost as destabilizing as the “average” mutation in these enzymes (+1.3 kcal/mol). Although their stability effects are not as dramatic as in key catalytic residues. mutations that modify the substrate binding pockets. and thus mediate new enzymatic specificities. place a larger stability burden than surface mutations that underline neutral. non-adaptive evolutionary changes. How are the destabilizing effects of functional mutations balanced to enable adaptation? Our analysis also indicated that many mutations that appear in directed evolution variants with no obvious role in the new function exert stabilizing effects that may compensate for the destabilizing effects of the crucial function-altering mutations.

Epistasis (i.e. non-additive interaction between mutations that affect fitness) is a mechanism that can contribute to both scenarios. Epistasis can constrain the type and order of selected mutations. but it can also make adaptive trajectories contingent upon the first random substitution. This effect is particularly strong under sign epistasis. when the sign of the fitness effects of a mutation depends on its genetic background. In the current study. we examine how epistatic interactions between mutations determine alternative evolutionary pathways. using in vitro evolution of the antibiotic resistance enzyme TEM-1 β-lactamase. First. we describe the diversity of adaptive pathways among replicate lines during evolution for resistance to a novel antibiotic (cefotaxime). Consistent with the prediction of epistatic constraints. most lines increased resistance by acquiring three mutations in a fixed order. However. a few lines deviated from this pattern. Next. to test whether negative interactions between alternative initial substitutions drive this divergence. alleles containing initial substitutions from the deviating lines were evolved under identical conditions. Indeed. these alternative initial substitutions consistently led to lower adaptive peaks. involving more and other substitutions than those observed in the common pathway.

103770,Arsenate replacing phosphate: alternative life chemistries and ion promiscuity,2011,Dan S Tawfik and Ronald E Viola,50,,7,1128-1134,American Chemical Society,A newly identified bacterial strain that can grow in the presence of arsenate and possibly in the absence of phosphate. has raised much interest. but also fueled an active debate. Can arsenate substitute for phosphate in some or possibly in most of the absolutely essential phosphate-based biomolecules. including DNA? If so. then the possibility of alternative. arsenic-based life forms must be considered. The physicochemical similarity of these two oxyanions speaks in favor of this idea. However. arsenate-esters and arsenate-diesters in particular are extremely unstable in aqueous media. Here. we explore the potential of arsenate to be used as substrate by phosphate-utilizing enzymes. We review the existing literature on arsenate enzymology. that intriguingly. dates back to the 1930s.

Here we used directed evolution to generate a variant of HaeIII methyltransferase that efficiently methylates a novel target site. M.HaeIII methylates the internal cytosine of the canonical sequence GGCC. but there is promiscuous methylation of a variety of non‐canonical sites. notably AGCC. at a reduced rate. Using in vitro compartmentalization (IVC). libraries of M.HaeIII genes were selected for the ability to efficiently methylate AGCC. A two‐step mutagenesis strategy. involving initial randomization of DNA‐contacting residues followed by randomization of the loop that lies behind these residues. yielded a mutant with a 670‐fold improvement in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KmDNA) using AGCC and a preference for AGCC over GGCC.

Fold polarity and stability trade-offs,2013,Eynat Dellus-Gur and Agnes Toth-Petroczy and Mikael Elias and Dan S Tawfik,425,Journal of molecular biology,14,2609-2621,Academic Press,Protein evolvability includes two elements—robustness (or neutrality. mutations having no effect) and innovability (mutations readily inducing new functions). How are these two conflicting demands bridged? Does the ability to bridge them relate to the observation that certain folds. such as TIM barrels. accommodate numerous functions. whereas other folds support only one? Here. we hypothesize that the key to innovability is polarity—an active site composed of flexible. loosely packed loops alongside a well-separated. highly ordered scaffold. We show that highly stabilized variants of TEM-1 β-lactamase exhibit selective rigidification of the enzyme's scaffold while the active-site loops maintained their conformational plasticity. Polarity therefore results in stabilizing. compensatory mutations not trading off. but instead promoting the acquisition of new activities.

These techniques target diversity to a number of chosen positions that are usually non-contiguous in the protein's primary structure.

Their closest known relatives. lactonases. with promiscuous phosphotriasterase activity. dubbed PTE-like lactonases (PLLs). share only 30% sequence identity and also differ in the configuration of their active-site loops.

Here. we present a new application of IVC for the selection of DNA-nuclease inhibitors. We developed a nano-droplets delivery system that allows the transport of various solutes. including metal ions. into the emulsion droplets. This transport mechanism was used to regulate the activity of colicin nucleases that were co-compartmentalized with the genes. so that the nucleases were activated by nickel or cobalt ions only after the potential inhibitor genes have been translated. Thus. genes encoding nuclease inhibitors survived the digestion and were subsequently amplified and isolated. Selection is therefore directly for inhibition. and not for binding of the nuclease.

However. certain proteins undergo reversible backbone rearrangements. Such metamorphic proteins provide a means of facilitating the evolution of new folds and architectures. However. because natural folds emerged at the early stages of evolution. the potential role of metamorphic intermediates in mediating evolutionary transitions of structure remains largely unexplored. We evolved a set of new proteins based on ∼100 amino acid fragments derived from tachylectin-2—a monomeric. 236 amino acids. five-bladed β-propeller. Their structures reveal a unique pentameric assembly and novel β-propeller structures. Although identical in sequence. the oligomeric subunits adopt two. or even three. different structures that together enable the pentameric assembly of two propellers connected via a small linker.

We compared not only rates per protein. but also rates per position within individual proteins. For ∼90% of proteins. the distribution of positional rates exhibits three peaks: a peak of slow evolving residues. with average log2[normalized rate]. log2μ. of ca. −2. corresponding primarily to core residues; a peak of fast evolving residues (log2μ ∼ 0.5) largely corresponding to surface residues; and a very fast peak (log2μ ∼ 2) associated with disordered segments. However. a unique fraction of proteins that evolve very slowly exhibit not only a negligible fast peak. but also a peak with a log2μ ∼ −4. rather than the standard core peak of −2.

However. the reconstruction of these putative evolutionary pathways after many millions of years of evolutionary drift has thus far proven difficult. with all attempts to date failing to produce a functional protein. Tachylecin-2 is a monomeric 236 amino acid. five-bladed β-propeller with five sugar-binding sites. This protein was isolated from a horseshoe crab that emerged ca 500 million years ago. The modular. yet ancient. nature of Tachylectin-2 makes it an excellent model for exploring the evolution of proteins from smaller subunits. To this end. we generated genetically diverse libraries by incremental truncation of the Tachylectin-2 gene and screened them for functional lectins.

Unexpectedly. these experiments often find that proteins are tolerant to most amino acid substitutions. including substitutions in positions that are highly conserved in nature. To obtain a more realistic distribution of the effects of protein mutations. we applied a laboratory drift comprising 17 rounds of random mutagenesis and selection of M.HaeIII. a DNA methyltransferase. During this drift. multiple mutations gradually accumulated. Deep sequencing of the drifted gene ensembles allowed determination of the relative effects of all possible single nucleotide mutations. Despite being averaged across many different genetic backgrounds. about 67% of all nonsynonymous. missense mutations were evidently deleterious. and an additional 16% were likely to be deleterious. In the early generations. the frequency of most deleterious mutations remained high. However. by the 17th generation. their frequency was consistently reduced. and those remaining were accepted alongside compensatory mutations. The tolerance to mutations measured in this laboratory drift correlated with sequence exchanges seen in M.HaeIII’s natural orthologs. The biophysical constraints dictating purging in nature and in this laboratory drift also seemed to overlap. Our experiment therefore provides an improved method for measuring the effects of protein mutations that more closely replicates the natural evolutionary forces. and thereby a more realistic view of the mutational space of proteins.,True,fy8CjqwAAAAJ:WC23djZS0W4C,54,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004421,8043837986384174294,/scholar?cites=8043837986384174294,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004421,0,0,0
