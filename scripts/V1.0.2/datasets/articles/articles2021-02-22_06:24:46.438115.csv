The study was carried out on 63 samples of faecal matter (42 from pets and 21 from owners). The ESBL screening was carried out using the Brilliance ESBL Oxoid chromogenic medium. The isolated strains that generated characteristic presumptive ESBL-producing colonies were cultivated on 5% sheep blood medium for the extraction of bacterial DNA using the boiled preps technique. The confirmation of E. coli species was performed molecularly based on the detection of blauidA and blauspA genes. Other Enterobacteriaceae species were identified based on the minimum biochemical characteristics using the MIU and TSI medium. The phenotypical confirmation of presumptive ESBL-producing strains was carried out using the Double Disc Synergy Test (DDST) using a combination of 3rd generation cephalosporins and beta-lactamase inhibitor agents. The determination of the resistance degree in other classes of antibiotics was carried out through the Kirby-Bauer diffusimetric method. and the results were interpreted according to the CLSI standard.

The aim was to follow the evolution of the resistance phenomena for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a current concern for clinicians and epidemiologists due to the intrinsic resistance to several classes of antibiotics. acquiring resistance and limiting therapeutic actions. It is a microorganism of major importance in the nosocomial infections developed both in the human and veterinary spaces. The tests were part of a more extensive study which was aimed at the correlating. identifying common resistance profile of P. aeruginosa strains of human and animal originated. Considering the pathogenic action of this bacterial species both for humans and animals. the data obtained can support the establishment of a mutual strategy to prevent and combat the action of strains having multiple resistance to antibiotics. Efflux transporters have a considerable role in the multidrug resistance (MDR) of P. aeruginosa. an important nosocomial pathogen. The lack of some antibiotics. active towards P. aeruginosa. makes the control of infection the most important measure against the MDR-P. aeruginosa strains.

Fallopian tube. or surrounding connective tissues) is a common gynecological problem. Ovarian pathology can occur at any time from fetal life to menopause. Sonography is a clinically important imaging modality for assessing whether an adnexal mass is likely benign or possibly malignant. Most ovarian surgeries are for benign disease and can be performed laparoscopically. Patients. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated all the patients from our Clinic who underwent laparoscopy for adnexal tumors in the last three year. We were studying the correlation of the preoperative ultrasound examination and the pathological result for each case. Results: In this study. there were included 71 patients who underwent a laparoscopic intervention for adnexal tumors. The average age was 33 years old (range 18 and 60 years old). The ultrasound findings were ovarian endometriosis in 23.9% of cases. left ovarian cysts (22.5%) and right ovarian tumors (18.3%). and the lowest percentage was of left ovarian tumors (8.5%).

1089234,Rolul vitaminei D în dezvoltarea fetală şi în apariţia diabetului gestaţional,2018,Radu Nicolae MATEESCU and Cristian Ioan POPESCU and Marie-Jeanne GARDESCU and Stelian CONCI and Antoine EDU,13,Romanian Journal of Medical Practice,2,,,Introducere. În ultimii ani. din cauza creşterii alarmante la nivel mondial a afecţiunilor metabolice şi a complicaţiilor acestor tulburări. cercetătorii au încercat să găsească noi mecanisme de apariţie a dezechilibrelor. În cursul acestor cercetări. au descoperit că vitamina D. puţin studiată anterior. joacă un rol important în prevenirea afecţiunilor de natură metabolică în sarcină. Numeroase studii de specialitate au evidenţiat rolul benefic al vitaminei D. mai ales în primul trimestru de sarcină. Vitamina D este un hormon secosteroid liposolubil cu un rol în metabolismul fosfo-calcic. esenţial în dezvoltarea musculoscheletală şi în absorbţia calciului. Pentru a deveni o substanţă biologic activă. după ce este secretată la nivel tegumentar. vitamina D suferă o serie de procese metabolice de activare la nivel renal. Ultimele studii au demonstrat că. pe lângă rinichi. ţesutul granulos şi placenta sunt situsuri de activare a acestui hormon.

Charles-Augustin Vandermonde published his Essai sur la Manière de Perfectionner l’Espèce Humaine. This treatise was situated within the French-led medical movement of meliorism. meant to increase public health by boosting the medical arrangement of marriages from all strata of society. What made Vandermonde different from his colleagues is that he was not just looking for a way to improve the health of society: he was also proposing a series of measures meant to increase the beauty of humankind. And. for the first time in the history of European medicine. he advocated mixed-race couplings as a means to obtain the best results. This latter development is so unexpected in the global setting of the Enlightenment that we could arguably hail Vandermonde as the founding father of what Michel Foucault later called ‘biopolitique’.5,True,8KrvfH0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932713000860,17149616364689186346,/scholar?cites=17149616364689186346,,,0,0,0

A modern technique to analyse shape is geometric morphometrics (GM). which offers a whole range of methods concerning the pure shape of an object. The results from these methods have provided new insights into biological problems and have become especially useful in the fields of entomology and palaeontology. Despite the conspicuous successes in other hymenopteran groups. GM analysis of wings and fossil wings of Formicidae has been neglected. Here we tested if landmarks defining the wing shape of fossil ants that belong to the genus Titanomyrma are reliable and if this technique is able to expose relationships among different groups of the largest Hymenoptera that ever lived. This study comprises 402 wings from 362 ants that were analysed and assigned with the GM methods linear discriminant function analysis. principal component analysis. canonical variate analysis. and regression. The giant ant genus Titanomyrma and the parataxon Formicium have different representatives that are all very similar but these modern methods were able to distinguish giant ant types even to the level of the sex. Thirty-five giant ant specimens from the Eckfeld Maar were significantly differentiable from a collection of Messel specimens that consisted of 187 Titanomyrma gigantea females and 42 T. gigantea males. and from 74 Titanomyrma simillima females and 21 T. simillima males.

However. the principal innovation of ants relative to their wasp ancestors was the evolution of a new phenotype: a wingless worker caste optimized for ground labour. Ant workers are famous for their ability to lift and carry heavy loads. but we know surprisingly little about the morphological basis of their strength. Here we examine the consequences of the universal loss of flight in ant workers on skeletomuscular adaptations in the thorax for enhanced foraging on six legs. Using X-ray microcomputed tomography and 3D segmentation. we compared winged queens and wingless workers in Euponera sikorae (subfamily Ponerinae) and Cataglyphis savignyi (subfamily Formicinae).

Past mutagenesis screens targeting maternal-effect genes identified a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from defects in oocyte development to embryonic patterning. However. earlier vertebrate screens did not reach saturation. anticipated classes of phenotypes were not uncovered. and technological limitations made it difficult to pinpoint the causal gene. In this study. we performed a chemically-induced maternal-effect mutagenesis screen in zebrafish and identified eight distinct mutants specifically affecting the cleavage stage of development and one cleavage stage mutant that is also male sterile. The cleavage-stage phenotypes fell into three separate classes: developmental arrest proximal to the mid blastula transition (MBT). irregular cleavage. and cytokinesis mutants. We mapped each mutation to narrow genetic intervals and determined the molecular basis for two of the developmental arrest mutants and a mutation causing male sterility and a maternal-effect mutant phenotype. One developmental arrest mutant gene encodes a maternal specific Stem Loop Binding Protein. which is required to maintain maternal histone levels. The other developmental arrest mutant encodes a maternal-specific subunit of the Minichromosome Maintenance Protein Complex. which is essential for maintaining normal chromosome integrity in the early blastomeres.

Bobori,12,Water,,1823,,Fish stock monitoring is an important element for the sustainable management of inland water resources. A scarcity of data and the lack of systematic monitoring for Lake Trichonis precludes an up-to-date assessment. To assess the current status of pelagic fish stock. a hydroacousting survey was conducted for the first time in Lake Trichonis. Greece. In October 2019. the lake was acoustically surveyed with two. horizontally and vertically mounted. 120 kHz transducers during day and night. A decreasing gradient in pelagic fish density from the western to the eastern shores of the lake was observed. Fish density was significantly higher in the intermediate layers of the water column. in the eastern region. compared to the western region. The lake appears to host primarily communities of small-sized fish (TL: 0–5 cm). whereas larger fish (TL: 5–50 cm) are a small minority of the total fish stock. The overall average estimated fish length was approximately 2.4 cm. The adoption of routine inland fish stock monitoring through hydroacoustic methods could be a promising step in the effort to improve the understanding of unique inland water ecosystems with minimum impact on endemic species. as well as to mitigate human impact and achieve long-term sustainable management.,True,B4iHe8UAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/6/1823,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/6/1823/pdf,0,0,0

Greece. using field data and satellite-based observations,,P Patoucheas and O Koukousioura and K Aligizaki and T Perivolioti and A Mouratidis and MD Dimiza and MV Triantaphyllou,,,,,,Methana volcanic area is situated at the southwest part of Saronic Gulf and at the eastern edge of the Aegean Volcanic arc. Near the coast. human activity (fish farming and tourism) has resulted in an increase in nutrients. mainly nitrates and phosphates. which are associated with the phenomenon of eutrophication. Within a distance from the shore. the ecosystem of the Saronic Gulf is characterized as oligotrophic. CO2 and heat emissions from the submarine volcano lead to the increase of average temperature in several stations with a relatively lower pH. while at some stations low radioactivity levels are observed. Methana can thus be considered as a small natural laboratory for the study of the effects on marine ecosystems related to anthropogenic activities. To date. only a few reports exist for this area. mainly related to the structure of phytoplankton populations.Phytoplankton was studied and classified using five stations in Methana area during two (warm and cold) sampling periods. while its cell concentrations were count using inverse microscopy.

It’s an “alien” invasion. and though it’s been going on for decades its implications to restoration and recovery efforts throughout the province are profound.Invasive non-native plant species (also called alien. introduced. or exotic) grow quickly and aggressively. These unwelcome plants disrupt the ecology of natural ecosystems by displacing native plants and the animal species that depend upon them reducing native biodiversity. In this century the greatest threat to our native plants and wildlife may well come from invasive species. This is not just a problem unique to BC. next to habitat loss over 50% of the loss of native biodiversity globally has been attributed to introduced species. and nearly half of the species listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act in the US are at risk due to competition with alien or introduced rivals.,True,M0sQnVEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/biodiversity/eflora/BattlingWiththeAlienInvasion-PamZevit.pdf,1311054258138126497,/scholar?cites=1311054258138126497,,http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/biodiversity/eflora/BattlingWiththeAlienInvasion-PamZevit.pdf,0,0,0

Along with this. recent shifts towards back end monitoring and performance based objectives by senior government conservation policy has somewhat led to a reduced ability for approving agencies to determine if projects being implemented are appropriate to local conditions or if problems are being addressed post completion. This requires a leap of faith that things are getting done right and to the benefit of the receiving environment. which may not be the case.

Biol.,,311-318,,In the Drosophila larva. major proprioceptive input is provided to the brain by sub-epidermal stretch receptors called chordotonal organs (ChO). Similarly to the body wall muscle that needs to be attached on both of its sides to the larval exoskeleton in order to generate movement. the sensory unit of a ChO must be stably anchored to the cuticle on both of its sides in order to sense the relative displacement of body parts. Through an RNAi screen we have identified thrombospondin (Tsp). a secreted calcium binding glycoprotein. as a critical component in the anchoring of ChOs to the cuticle. We show that the Tsp protein starts to accumulate in the extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the ChO attachment cells towards the end of embryogenesis and that it becomes highly concentrated at the attachment junction during larval stages. In the absence of Tsp. the ChO’s accessory cells fail to form a stable junction with their epidermal attachment cells and organ integrity is not maintained. Tsp is a known player in the establishment of the myotendinous junctions in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Thus. our findings extend the known similarities between muscle-attachment and ChO-attachment cells. In addition to its role in establishing the ChO attachment junctions. Tsp was found to affect ligament cell migration and cap cell elongation. Most interestingly. the Tsp protein was found to decorate the ChO cap cells along their entire length. suggesting that the elongated cap cells are supported by the ECM to which they attach via integrin-based. Tsp-dependent. adhesion plaques. The ECM enwrapping the cap cells is probably important for keeping the cap …,True,qJqM2TkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/160275as,6244787802025577696,/scholar?cites=6244787802025577696,,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/160275as,0,0,0

The objective of this study is to understand the behavior of ovalbumin as radical scavenger when it binds to antioxidants such as aspirin and caffeine (as a complex).Methods: In this study. docking sites and ovalbumin as scavenger were studied using computer-modeling software. An ovalbumin was used only for computer modeling. whereas in the wet laboratory. the freeze-drying albumin was used for electron spin resonance (ESR) and Fourier transforminfrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to determine its ability as a scavenger and functional groups. respectively. Albumin solution was applied to measure the viscosity.Results: The variability of tridimensional structures of aspirin was investigated after binding with ovalbumin. However. these structures cannot be seen clearly on caffeine. The root-mean-square deviation analysis showed that aspirin. as well as caffeine. altered the dynamic conformation of ovalbumin. The complex of aspirin-ovalbumin-caffeine which was treated at a temperature of− 70 C showed intermolecular force.

Results5. ConclusionsObjectiveAlthough more IVF centers are adopting trophectoderm biopsy for PGS instead of “cleavage stage”(D3). some clinics still offer these two options to their patients. One of the main challenges with D3 biopsy procedures is the limited amount of genetic material available to perform analysis. Limited genetic material may give a no result diagnosis or a chaotic profile. which are common in apoptotic cells and/or DNA damage during biopsy. These results leads to inconclusive diagnoses posing a burden on reproductive care providers on whether to biopsy these “non conclusive” embryos or to discard them. The aim of this study was to determine the likelihood that a D3 biopsy without a diagnosis. will have a genetically assigned diagnosis when allowed to grow to day 5/6. and to compare that diagnosis to a control group of blastocysts of similar maternal age. to determine if blastocysts …,True,LJqPizcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)61594-7/abstract,6618467182730572873,/scholar?cites=6618467182730572873,,https://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(16)61594-7/pdf,0,0,0

The signatures of all kinds of defects are computed in terms of energy and simulated scanning transmission electron microscopy images.

1089342,Impact of Hydrogen on Graphene-based Materials: Atomistic Modeling and Simulation of HRSTEM Images,2018,Cyril Guedj and Léonard Jaillet and François Rousse and Stephane Redon,,,,,,The hydrogen energy transition is highly probable. because hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and represents an ideal “green” source of energy. Meanwhile. the safe hydrogen production and storage remains a major challenge still in progress. Potential production and storage materials include graphene. In terms of electronic and optoelectronic applications. hydrogen can tune the bandgap of graphene [1]. Hydrogen also plays a major role during the Chemical Vapour Decomposition (CVD) growth of graphene [2]. Hence. hydrogenated graphene-based materials are potentially relevant for various technological applications.  To understand and optimize the device efficiency and the interface engineering. it is advantageous to perform advanced nanocharacterizations. linked to numerical modelling and simulations. This task is particularly difficult. because hydrogen is labile and prone to rapid reorganization. This structural evolution may be monitored with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques [3.4.5]. but in spite of significant progresses. the direct detection of hydrogen with High Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRSTEM) or energy-loss spectroscopy still remains a serious challenge.  We investigate here the interaction of hydrogen with graphene using the Brenner module of the SAMSON software platform https://www.samson-connect.net and we propose an original methodology to characterize its structural arrangement at the atomic scale by simulating HRSTEM images to interpret experimental results.

La simulation moléculaire a eu ces dernières décennies un impact scientifique énorme en biologie. en électronique. en science des matériaux … La simulation de particules est une des méthodes classiques de dynamique moléculaire. les molécules y sont divisées en atomes. leurs interactions relatives calculées et leurs trajectoires déduites pas à pas. Malheureusement un calcul précis des interactions entre atomes demande énormément d'opérations et donc de temps. ce qui limite la portée de la simulation moléculaire à des systèmes de taille raisonnable. C'est dans ce contexte que notre équipe recherche de nouveaux modèles de simulation moléculaire rapide et précis. Un des angles de recherche est l'élimination des calculs inutiles des simulations.

Meanwhile. the safe hydrogen production and storage remains a major challenge still in progress. Potential production and storage materials include graphene. In terms of electronic and optoelectronic applications. hydrogen can tune the bandgap of graphene [1]. Hydrogen also plays a major role during the Chemical Vapour Decomposition (CVD) growth of graphene [2]. Hence. hydrogenated graphene-based materials are potentially relevant for various technological applications.To understand and optimize the device efficiency and the interface engineering. it is advantageous to perform advanced nanocharacterizations. linked to numerical modelling and simulations.

Therefore. the nigrescens is more considered. However. the virescens gives a visual cue that fruits are ripe without waiting to detach. In 2010. Indonesian Oil Palm Research Institute (IOPRI) successfully planted an open-pollinated population of Cameroon oil palm. The population was characterized for virescens type frequency. as well as the bunch components. quantity and quality of crude palm oil. The virescens frequency per accession was sufficiently wide. ranging from 3.33-65.71%. and was affected by the parent type. nigrescens or virescens. Most of the virescens’s fruit form is observed to be of dura. except one sample. which was observed to be tenera. The mesocarp to fruit (MF) and industrial extraction ratio (IER) percentage are similar to the nigrescens dura. namely 37.7% and 9.5%. respectively. Its oil quality is better than nigrescens. and it has total carotene ranging from 155-1246 ppm. The oleic fatty acid is higher than 50%. and the palmitic is lower than 40%.

1089370,Nationwide survey on the barriers to converting turfgrass lawns to pollinator-friendly native wildflowers.,2020,Nash E Turley and Joshua Hogan and Gloria J Diehl and Aaron C Stack and Barbara J Sharanowski,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,The abundance and diversity of insect pollinators around the world is declining and habitat loss is a leading cause. Turfgrass lawns cover a vast area in North America and provide a great opportunity for habitat restoration to native wildflowers by the general public. Efforts to encourage the public to replace lawns with wildflowers could be improved by a better understanding of the thoughts and opinions of the public about lawns. We conducted a nationwide online survey to understand what barriers are most important in preventing people from converting a 6 ? 6 ft portion of turfgrass lawn to native wildflowers. We also collected data on a variety of demographic factors to see if those influence survey responses. Over 3200 people took survey across the US. We found that ‘Maintenance time’ and ‘Not knowing what to do’ were the most important barriers to creating wildflower habitat. Age was the most important demographic factor impacting results with young people significantly more likely to select multiple barriers in the survey. For example. people aged 18-34 were 4.3 times more likely to indicate ‘Maintenance cost’ would prevent them from creating a wildflower plot than those age 65 or older. Those who had already created a wildflower plot. or those who were members in a native plant or pollinator organization were less likely to select barriers across the board. except for external barriers related to homeowners associations. neighbors. and local governments. This shows that these are persistent concerns even for those that are otherwise keen to create wildflower habitat. Our results suggest that outreach promoting pollinator-friendly native …,True,2bO-QF4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.02.129452v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/02/2020.06.02.129452.full.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore. it is of the requirement to create innovative methods in seafood production. Caulerpa lentillifera J. Agardh is a well-known seaweed for its properties and edible. We cultured C. lentillifera in a recirculating aquaculture system under laboratory conditions. However. after 7 days the culture was invaded by epiphyte algae Lyngbya sp. This experiment was designed to remove those algae by using light density as a treatment. Two irradiances were tested including 20 μmol photons m-2. s-1 (low light density) and 40 μmol photons m-2. s-1 (initial light density). Every week we measured the stolon length. thallus weight. and calculated the specific growth rate. Results showed that after 30 days C. lentillifera under low light density regained their healthy green color and Lyngbya sp. was no longer present. Meanwhile. in the initial light density (40 μmol photons m-2. s-1) Lyngbya sp. covered almost all thalli of C. lentillifera. and half of them were dead. The measured results of specific growth rate (% d-1) and weight (g) of C. lentillifera in low light density conditions were better than those of C. lentillifera in the initial condition.

John Hopfield wrote a classical paper with a simple mathematical representation of the general mechanisms of memory storage and recovery in the human brain. He proposed a model for the construction of artificial neural networks with the ability to store” memories”(network states) and recover them from fragments of their content. The collective behavior of the set of neurons defines a dynamical system in which the network state converges to one of the stored memories. The structure of the net resembles that of the hippocampus and captures some of the fundamental processes occurring in it. The model went through multiple variations in the following years. and some versions of it are now implemented in neuroscience studies related to learning and memory.

Prion diseases are caused when the prion protein PrPC misfolds into PrPSc. which is capable of inducing further misfolding in healthy PrPC proteins. Recent in vivo experimental results have shown that pharmacological chaperone treatment can be used to prevent this conversion. where the pharmacological chaperones act as a short-term “vaccine” against the PrPSc proteins. A second strategic approach uses interferons to decrease the concentration of PrPSc. In this work. a model using a non-linear system of ordinary differential equations is constructed to model how these two treatments slow the proliferation of prions in the brain. Through this work it was found that interferons have a greater effect on the prion population over time. but that the pharmacological chaperones begin to effect the system earlier.

Primarily. the TNs (influent and effluent) were off-line measured with the ultraviolet spectrophotometry. and the flowrate of wastewater was the field data from on-line monitoring system. Subsequently. combining with the two variables. the determinate emission rate factor of N 2 O was applied to the estimation of the N 2 O emission. The results showed that the averaged 15.234 mg/m 3 of N 2 O was emitted during the biological nitrogen removal process in a paper mill. In addition. we analyzed some influencing factors during the operation in this article. including the dissolved oxygen (DO). pH. nitrite concentration and COD/N ratios. And the nitrite concentration in the wastewater directly increased the N 2 O generation. except that other parameters have the modest influence.

Indonesia. Ocean Life 2: 54-58. Plastic debris enters the marine ecosystem in various sizes. ranging from micrometers to millimeters. Specific densities of plastic particles can vary greatly depending on the type of polymer and the manufacturing process. The highest microplastic density is usually related to the shoreline and circulation of currents in the middle of the sea. Microplastics are then degraded into fragments or particles that are very small and digested by marine biota. In recent years. there have been increasing environmental concerns about microplastics. The purpose of this study was to determine the types of microplastics and their density in the Karimunjawa Island region. and to determine the environmental impact of microplastics. The method used was sediment sampling. with sand samples taken at a depth of 2-5 cm from the sand surface in a plot that was 10 meters away. with another plot in a 50-meter straight line. After that. microplastics were separated from sand samples in the laboratory using saturated saline solution. Next. the microplastics identification process was carried out by differentiating based on color. size. number. and microplastic form or category. In this study. four types of microplastic were found. ie fiber. fragment. film. and foam. At Legon Lele Beach and Ujung Gelam. fiber was the most abundant with 111 and 66 particles. respectively.

Due to the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) Mtb strain. tuberculosis. an otherwise. curable and avertable disease still remains as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Isoniazid (INH) forms the first line of anti-TB drug while Ethionamide (ETH) is used as the second line of anti-TB drug. INH and ETH resistance develop through a network of genes involved in various biosynthetic pathways. In this study. we identified Rv0023. an Mtb protein belonging to the XRE family of transcription regulators. which has a role in generating higher tolerance towards INH and ETH in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg). Overexpression of Rv0023 in Msmeg leads to the development of INH and ETH tolerant strains. The strains expressing Rv0023 have a higher ratio of NADH/NAD+. and this physiological event is known to play a crucial role in the development of INH/ETH co-resistance in Msmeg. Gene expression analysis of some target genes revealed reduction in the expression of ndh gene. but no direct interaction was observed between the Rv0023 and ndh promoter region. Rv0023 is divergently expressed to Rv0022 ( whiB5) and we observed direct interaction of recombinant Rv0023 protein with the upstream region of Rv0022 and this was confirmed using reporter constructs in Msmeg. However. we found no indication that this interaction might play a role in the development of INH/ETH drug tolerance.,True,BhVreSAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00003/full,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00003/full,0,0,0

Cellular models of memory. such as long‐term potentiation and long‐term depression. share common principles to memory consolidation. As for memory. the maintenance of synaptic plasticity is dependent on the synthesis of de novo protein synthesis. The synaptic‐tagging and capture hypothesis states that the maintenance of synaptic plasticity is dependent on the interplay between input‐specific synaptic tags and the allocation or capture of plasticity‐related proteins (PRPs) at activated synapses. The setting of the synaptic tag and the capture of PRPs are independent processes that can occur separated in time and different groups of activated synapses.

The methodology was extended to the synthesis of the end-functionalized homo polypeptides (15 to 50 repeat unit) and block co-polypeptides with PEG (0.7 K. 2 K. and 5 K) and glycopolypeptide (15-unit mannose glycopolypeptide) as one of the blocks. The deprotected fully water-soluble anionic phosphate-based polypeptides showed pH-dependent helical conformation with a helical content of 20%. which further changed to β-sheets upon addition of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) due to dephosphorylation. The block co-polypeptide containing PEG as one of the blocks led to its self-assembly into colloidal structures. such as vesicles with a hydrodynamic diameter of~ 250 nm. due to the formation of amphiphilic block co-polymer upon dephosphorylation. The nature of the colloidal structures formed can be temporally controlled by the extent of dephosphorylation.

Loewen and C.A Hornby and M. Johnson and C. Chambers and K. Dawson and D. MacDonell and W. Bernhardt and R. Gnanapragasam and M. Pierrejean and E. Choy,,,,,,The Government of Canada has committed to protect 10% of its coastal and marine areas. One means of protection is through the development of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). In Nunavut. Regional Inuit Associations along with other stakeholders provided guidance to identify potential Areas of Interest (AOI) for a Marine Protected Area process. In the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut. the marine waters adjacent to Southampton Island (SI) were identified as one AOI. The Southampton Island Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area (SI EBSA) provides valuable migratory habitat for Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas). Bowhead (Balaena mysticetus) and Narwhal (Monodon monoceros). as well as feeding and calving areas for a proportion of these marine mammal populations. The SI EBSA is home to large aggregations of seabirds such as the two colonies of Thick-Billed Murres (Uria lomvia) on Coats Island and the largest single colony of Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) in Nunavut. Resident marine mammals to the SI EBSA include Walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) and Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) populations. In addition. migratory Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) are the most abundant salmonid that is available for subsistence harvesting to Inuit communities living adjacent to the SI EBSA. The recurring polynya in Roes Welcome Sound provides approximately 52 km2 of open water during winter and is believed to play an important role in deep water formation and nutrient cycling in Hudson Bay. which may support high benthic productivity. and in turn large numbers of migrating birds and marine mammals.

Our study investigated the influence of sponge gardens at the Frobisher Bay site (138 m) and bamboo corals at the Baffin Bay site (1007 m) on the infaunal community structure and benthic ecosystem functioning. The occurrence of both types of biogenic structure type enhanced particular taxa and/or feeding guilds. A large density of suspension filter feeders was observed in bamboo coral sediment. whereas bare sediment exhibited a large proportion of nematodes and deposit-detritus feeders. Sponge gardens’ sediment showed a high proportion of isopods. Paraonidae polychaetes and up/down conveyors whereas bare sediment exhibited a large density of filter feeders. Through incubation cores. we measured ex-situ benthic nutrient and oxygen fluxes at the sediment-water interface in each habitat and site. Biogeochemical fluxes varied significantly between habitats in the Baffin Bay site with a significant impact of bamboo coral habitat on nutrient fluxes (nitrate. ammonium and silicate). Surprisingly. the sediment hosting bamboo corals acted as a source of nitrate and ammonium reaching values similar or higher to the Frobisher site despite the difference in water depth. and thus food supply between the two sites. These significant releases could derive from (i) a high organic matter deposition in bamboo coral habitat. allowed by their erected structure. (ii) a high efficiency of bioturbators (surficial modifiers and burrowers) mixing the surface layer of the sediment and (iii) the difference in sediment …,True,QmfwTUYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00495/full,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00495/full,0,0,0

The magnitude of groundwater fluoride contamination is aggravated by increasing anthropogenic activities. Groundwater is supposedly the main source through which people are highly exposed to fluoride. compared with other sources of exposure. Among human populations. fluoride-related health issues span from mild effects on teeth and bones to severe kidney problems. neurotoxicity. and even cancer.

1089496,Identifying priority areas for restoring large mammal populations in the Caucasus Ecoregion,2018,Tobias Kuemmerle and Benjamin Blehyl and Hendrik Bluhm and Arash Ghoddousi and Aurel Heidelberg and Sevinj Sarukhanova and Nugzar Zazanashvili,,,,,Open Science Centre. University of Jyväskylä,Large mammals play critical roles in ecosystems. yet their populations are across the globe as a result of habitat loss. overhunting. and human-wildlife conflicts. Some of these threats have lessened considerably in parts of Europe. particularly in mountain regions. and this offers unique opportunities for restoring large mammal populations to ecologically functional levels. However. many species require active conservation planning and management for achieving this goal. We focused on the Caucasus Ecoregion. a global biodiversity hotspot at the crossroads of Europe. Central Asia and the Middle East. with a variety of large carnivore and herbivore species. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought about major changes in this region. including armed conflicts. low levels of institutional control. and economic hardship. Altogether this resulted in plummeting populations of many large mammal species that today hold out only in small and fragmented populations. In contrast. the institutional changes in the post-Soviet countries have also led to widespread land-use changes. such as agricultural abandonment and declining livestock numbers. providing opportunities for restoring large mammal populations. We mapped suitable habitat for Bezoar goat (Capra aegagrus). European bison (Bison bonasus). Gmelin’s mouflon (Ovis orientalis) and Goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). all of which are of conservation concern. across the ecoregion. To do so. we used species distribution models. a range of environmental and human-disturbance-related covariates. and extensive datasets of large mammal occurrence.

Pumpkin and Barley for development of extrudates,2018,A Jabeen and S Hassan and L Masoodi and N Ajaz and A Rafiq,9,Journal of Food Processing & Technology,1,1-9,,Barley based extruded snacks containing pumpkin and lentil was produced using twin screw extruder. Response surface methodology were used to optimize and evaluate the effect of three independent variables viz. feed composition (50% to 90% barley flour; 2.5% to 42.5% lentil flour and 7.5% pumpkin flour). moisture content (13% to 21%) and barrel temperature (115 C to 155 C) on lateral expansion. bulk density. water absorption index. water solubility index. SME and breaking strength of extrudates. Low barrel temperature and low moisture content were found to enhance the lateral expansion (37-70.8) whereas low barley content significantly reduced lateral expansion of extrudates. A significant increase in water absorption index was (5.34 g/g to 6.23 g/g) observed at high moisture content. The negative regression coefficients of feed composition. barrel temperature and moisture content revealed that these parameters reduced water solubility index of extrudates. Higher moisture content depicted positive effect on breaking strength (178.71-325.77 N) whereas increased barley content significantly reduced effect on breaking strength. Lower values of bulk density were observed at lower values of moisture content. Low moisture content significantly reduced effect on bulk density. The specific mechanical energy of barley based extrudates ranged in between 221.07 to 327.45 W hr/kg. a significant decrease in specific mechanical energy was observed at low moisture content.

Heterosigma akashiwo. has been the cause of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in waterways around the world causing millions of dollars in damage to farmed animals and destroying ecosystems. Developing a fundamental understanding of their movements and interactions through phototaxis and chemotaxis is vital to comprehending why these HABs start to form and how they can be prevented. We develop a one-and two-dimensional mathematical and computational model reflecting the movement of an ecology of plankton. incorporating both run-and-tumble motion and autochemotaxis. We present a succession of complex and biologically meaningful models combined with a sequence of laboratory and computational experiments that inform the ideas underlying the model. By analyzing the dynamics and pattern formation which are similar to experimental observations. we identify parameters that are significant in plankton's pattern formation in the absence of bulk fluid flow. We numerically analyze variations on how might plankton deposit chemical and connect the outcomes with features observed in experimental observations.,True,GmyRkDMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03221,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03221,0,0,0

In addition to a specific EPS glycocalyx. we recently revealed that the social δ-proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus secretes a novel biosurfactant polysaccharide (BPS). with both EPS and BPS polymers required for type IV pilus (T4P)-dependent swarm expansion via spatio-specific biofilm expression profiles.  Thus the synergy between EPS and BPS secretion somehow modulates the multicellular lifecycle of M. xanthus.  Herein. we demonstrate that BPS secretion functionally-activates the EPS glycocalyx via its destabilization. fundamentally altering the characteristics of the cell surface.  This impacts motility behaviours at the single-cell level as well as the aggregative capacity of cells in groups via EPS fibril formation and T4P assembly.  These changes modulate structuration of swarm biofilms via cell layering. likely contributing to the formation of internal swarm polysaccharide architecture.

Using TIRF and force microscopy. we herein identify the integrin αI-domain-like outer-membrane (OM) lipoprotein CglB as an essential substratum-coupling protein of the gliding motility complex.  Similar to most known OM lipoproteins. CglB is anchored on the periplasmic side of the OM and thus a mechanism must exist to secrete it to the cell surface in order for it to interact with the underlying substratum.  We reveal this process to be mediated by a predicted OM β-barrel structure of the gliding complex.  This OM platform was found to regulate the conformational activation and secretion of CglB across the OM.  These data suggest that the gliding complex promotes surface exposure of CglB at bFAs. thus explaining the manner by which forces exerted by inner-membrane motors are transduced across the cell envelope to the substratum; they also uncover a novel protein secretion mechanism. highlighting the ubiquitous connection between secretion and bacterial motility.,True,Zhn5eH4AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.216333v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/07/22/2020.07.22.216333.full.pdf,0,0,0

Pour ces deux motilités. des polysaccharides sécrétés sont importants dans leurs mécanismes. Bien que le polysaccharide impliqué dans le twitching soit caractérisé. celui du gliding ne l’est pas.

The study is based on a questionnaire distributed to 42 PSTs at a state university in East-Java after they took part in a teaching internship program. The questionnaire focuses on the contexts the PSTs used in their teaching and how the contexts were used. Additionally. eight of the PSTs who taught each unit on environmental pollution were interviewed to more deeply explore how they carried out contexts in their teaching practice and whether or not they presented the topics as socio-scientific issues (SSIs). Most of the PSTs stated that they had used daily life contexts quite often when teaching. The most frequent contexts the PSTs used were daily life objects and questions related to society and the environment. The contexts were mostly introduced at the beginning of the lesson. before the science content was taught. They suggested that the function of contexts was generally for motivational purposes and for student engagement with science concepts. The contexts were rarely used to provoke societal discussions. even though the PSTs acknowledged that many contexts can be used in the sense of socio-scientific issues and were considered to potentially provoke discussions beyond science.,True,IHtK0VkAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.592870/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Education&id=592870,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.592870/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Education&id=592870,0,0,0

Заповедная наука,2,2-12,"Фонд поддержки и развития заповедных территорий"" Медвежья Земля""",A group of griffon vultures in Kresna Gorge was studied for its visit on the feeding station next to Rakitna Village after being reintroduced in the area. A camera trap method was used for a better understanding of the breeding behaviour of the griffon vulture. including the intraand inter-species relations. A statistically significant difference was found between the independent feeding events during the pre-incubation and incubation periods of vultures. The duration of those events also differs. the ones in the second period being longer. Furthermore. a statistically significant difference was observed between the number of vultures per photo for the two sample periods. as a result of a different number of unmarked wild birds and different activity patterns of the nesting pairs. In spite of the fact that the terrestrial predators are also active during the night. their daytime presence leads to a high enough overlap between the two ecological groups. showing that the carnivores are a disturbance factor for the scavengers. The raven is the most abundant species at the feeding site and thus is a food competitor to the griffon vulture. The two species have adapted their behaviour to use the feeding station more successfully during the different biological periods. A significant decrease in the activity overlap between the individuals of the successfully nesting pairs was observed on the feeding station after the beginning of the incubation period. On the other hand. the activity overlap of the unsuccessfully nesting pairs increased in the second sample period. Camera traps can be used in further studies of the mating ecology for individual breeding pairs. when a direct …,True,rAqQp1oAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/17644736,9695673862237384090,/scholar?cites=9695673862237384090,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/17644736,0,0,0

Objective: To investigate validity of salivary IL6 as a biomarker to diagnose osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.Patients and Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on 75 postmenopausal women. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to diagnose osteoporosis. Salivary IL6 was measured for all postmenopausal women by using Human ELISA kit. Results: Of a total 75 individual involved in the study. 25 were healthy postmenopausal women. 25 had osteopenia. and 25 had osteoporosis. There was no statistical significant differences between age and body mass index in all groups (p> 0.05). Mean level of salivary IL6 was significantly different among healthy controls. osteopenic group. and osteoporotic group (11.66±4.44 vs 14.51±6.5 vs 23.9±5.52 pg/ml; p< 0.001) respectively. The mean salivary IL-6 was significantly higher in osteoporosis group (23.9 pg/ml) compared to control group (11.66 pg/ml).

It refers to many conditions can be categorized into: electrical. circulatory and structural disorders. Warfarin drug is widely used anticoagulant medication for treatment of thrombosis and embolism. Patients on warfarin treatment are susceptible to bleeding and cannot perform oral hygiene practice properly therefore. periodontal diseases are commonly seen in those patients.The study was carried out on 42 individuals (22 with heart disease taking warfarin drug as case group and 20 healthy individuals as control group). Non-stimulated whole saliva samples were obtained by expectoration. Salivary flow rate was measured as ml/min. salivary C-reactive protein and albumin levels were measured by using auto-analyzer. Periodontal status was assessed by measurement of clinical attachment loss for both groups. The mean salivary flow rate was significantly lower in case group compared to healthy controls (P= 0.02). The mean salivary C reactive protein and albumin levels were significantly higher in the case group than the control group (p= 0.003). Clinical attachment loss was significantly higher in case group than controls (p< 0.001). Salivary flow rate decrease in patients with heart disease.

Objective: To assess validity of clinical attachment loss (CAL) for diagnose osteoporosis in post-menopausal womenPatients and Methods: This cross sectional study included 75 postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis was diagnosed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). CAL was calculated using the probing pocket depth and the level of the gingival marginResults: Of 75 women involved in the study. 25 were healthy postmenopausal women. 25 had osteopenia. and 25 had osteoporosis. There was no statistical significant differences between age and body mass index in all groups (p> 0.05). The effect of osteoporosis on increasing CAL was stronger (ROC area= 0.92) than that of osteopenia (ROC area= 0.68). Clinical attachment loss showed high statistically significant moderately strong (r= 0.55) positive linear correlation with bone t-score. CALwas a valid parameter to predict osteoporosis in postmenopausal woman (ROC area= 0.88. p< 0.001).

Among the sources of food in the country and around the globe today are fish products from aquaculture such as the Nile Tilapia. Nile Tilapia is a popular fish sold in the market where it might be exposed to microbial contaminants such as Escherichia coli. Escherichia coli is a fecal bacterium used as an indicator for the biological conditions of food and the environment (FAO. 2016; Carson et al. 2001). Contamination with E. coli may be from the waters in the aquaculture ponds. the handlers or storage in contaminated ice (Rocha et al 2004; Lateef et al. 2004). Antimicrobial resistant strains may be positively selected for by antibiotics in the environment. which may lead to the dissemination by mobile genetic elements of resistance to potentially pathogenic bacteria (Alexander et al. 2010; Berglund. 2015). In the Philippines. antimicrobial agents. which are used for treatment of infectious diseases. are still routinely used to promote the growth of food animals like tilapia fish in aquaculture.

The extracts were found to be essential oils in 10 MPa and secondary metabolites in 20 & 30 MPa. DPPH Assay revealed that the SC-CO2 extracts have an antioxidant activity through the determination of its radical scavenging activity along with ascorbic acid which can be summarized in the order: 10 MPa< 30 MPa< 20 MPa< ascorbic acid. Results of TLC-bioautography using 2.54 mM DPPH showed that the compounds have antioxidant property through the change in color of the extracts in the TLC plate. which confirms the DPPH Radical Scavenging Assay.

1089726,Sedimentary Midges as Paleoindicators of Deep-water Oxygen Conditions Across a Broad Trophic Gradient in Boreal Lakes,2019,Brigitte Simmatis,,,,,,Cultural eutrophication. the addition of excess nutrients to an aquatic system. is a significant water quality concern that often promotes excess algal growth and deep-water oxygen depletion. Deep-water oxygen also influences internal nutrient loading and is an important parameter used to assess cold-water fish habitat. though long-term data are often unavailable. Chironomid (Diptera: Chironomidae) assemblages have been shown to change with deep-water oxygen concentrations and can therefore be used to reconstruct these missing data sets. This thesis used paleolimnological techniques to analyze inferred whole-lake primary production. sedimentary chironomid assemblages. and inferred volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen to determine how cold-water fish habitat has changed through time. I will also examine whether biological recovery after nutrient-targeting remediation was introduced was evident in sedimentary chironomid assemblages. I focused on two lakes with increasing inferred whole-lake primary production (Muskrat and Stoco lakes. Ontario) and one lake with decreasing inferred primary production (Lac Duhamel. near Mont Tremblant. Québec) over time. The majority of change in response to elevated inferred whole-lake primary production is evident in littoral taxa and head capsule concentrations. though oxy-conforming profundal taxa (e.g. Micropsectra) did respond to increased whole-lake primary production. Overall. deep-water oxygen recovery after nutrient-targeting remediation was not evident in the sedimentary chironomid assemblages and that there were generally only subtle responses to elevated whole-lake …,True,uejlDZkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/handle/1974/25914,,,,https://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/handle/1974/25914/Simmatis_Brigitte_SG_201812_MSC.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

We aimed (i) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FISH for the detection of Acinetobacter spp. in blood culture specimens and (ii) to test the simultaneous application of two genusspecific probes labeled with the same fluorochrome to increase the fluorescent signal intensity and improve the detection of Acinetobacter spp. Three hundred and twenty blood culture specimens were tested via both the conventional laboratory methods and FISH to detect Acinetobacter spp. The specimens were examined separately with each genus-specific probe Aci and ACA. and also using a mixture of the both probes Aci and ACA. In all examinations. probe EUB338 was used accompanied by Aci and ACA. The specificity of FISH was 100%(97.5% confidence interval [CI]= 98.7%–100%). The sensitivity of FISH by the use of probe Aci was 96.4%(95% CI= 81.7%–99.9%). whereas. the sensitivity of this technique by the use of probe ACA as well as by the combination of both probes Aci and ACA was 100%(97.5% CI= 87.7%–100%). Moreover. simultaneous hybridization by probes Aci and ACA increased the fluorescent signal of Acinetobacter spp. cells to 3+ in 13 specimens. In conclusion. FISH. particularly using a combination of Aci and ACA. is a highly accurate method for the detection of Acinetobacter spp. in blood cultures.

The aim of the experiment is to identify possible contributors to the sudden decrease in honey bee population over the past 60 years. a phenomenon known as the colony collapse disorder. Analysis was performed on three sets of bees: the control group which was not in contact with pesticides. the infected dead group which was a set of bees suspected to have died due to neonicotinoids. and the infected alive group which was suspected to be under the influence of neonicotinoids. After dissecting the bee samples and extracting their fat bodies. the chemical composition and protein structures of the samples were analyzed using Mid-IR beamline at the Canadian Light Source. Results from the spectrographs of bee samples exposed to neonicotinoids demonstrated possible residual pesticide chemicals within fat bodies. Several spectral peaks were also correlated with possible changes in protein secondary structures within fat bodies of neonicotinoid-affected bees. It is likely that the pesticides caused the change in protein assembly structures. which is known to be correlated with disease. paralysis. and death. coinciding with symptoms of Colony Collapse Disorder.,True,zzfDDe4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/205112v1.abstract,17397541026635116437,/scholar?cites=17397541026635116437,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/03/13/205112.full.pdf,0,0,0

West Nile and Japanese encephalis virus. Zika virus causes acute. serious illness which is often fatal if it is not treated. Its name comes from the Zika forest of Uganda. Zika is a mosquito born disease. Zika virus disease is caused by a virus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. People with Zika virus disease can have symptoms including mild fever. skin rash. conjunctivitis. muscle and joint pain. malaise or headache. These symptoms normally last for 2-7 days. There is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Links to other neurological complications are also being investigated. Neither an effective treatment nor a vaccine is available for Zika virus; therefore. the public health response primarily focuses on preventing infection. particularly in pregnant women.

Sugars are also important signaling molecules and are transported over long distances via xylem and phloem. Sucrose loading to tracheids and vessels is associated with bulk xylem pressure and occurs seasonally in temperate broadleaf eudicot trees. Following restoration of xylem hydraulic conductivity in spring. sugars are unloaded from xylem sap at apical branches and deposited as starch before growth of shoot apical meristems. Growth of cambia and shoot apical meristems leads to starch catabolism that yields hexose-phosphates to fuel cell growth and regulate other signal networks.

The chitin-rich middle layer is itself composed of several porous chitin laminae. Modelling heat conduction through the plunger cross-section revealed that the chitin-rich layer is able to insulate heat and retard its progress through the material. Heat accumulates in the plunger after a series of successive snaps and as such. its thermally resistant design can be considered most useful under the conditions of successive snapping. The plunger has a concurrent mechanical damage-tolerant design with biogenic mineral layers. viscous (chitin–mineral) interfaces. energy-dissipating porous chitin. and sidewalls composed of ordered. layered aragonite.

Genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships of Thelymitra javanica Blume (Orchidaceae: Orchidoideae) in East and Central Java. Indonesia. Biodiversitas 21: 1174-1181. Thelymitra JR Forst & G. Forst is a terrestrial orchid genera and mainly distributed in Australia as a center of its diversification. Moreover. Thelymitra javanica Blume is the only species of Thelymitra found in Asia. especially in Indonesia. In Australia and New Zealand. most of Thelymitra species easily found in lowland. whereas. T. javanica in Indonesia preferred to grows near the peaks of mountains around 2.000-3.000 m asl. The high altitude correlated with high light intensity and lower soil nutrients which require specific adaptation of plant to survive. The wide range of adaptation could be due to the presence of genetic variability among populations of Thelymitra. Therefore. this study was carried out to assess the genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships of T. javanica in East and Central Java. The genetic variability of Thelymitra was evaluated by molecular approaches. which is preferably utilized to determine the plant taxonomy to establish the taxonomic uncertainties. ITS-nrDNA is a popular DNA marker that widely used in phylogenetic study among various taxa. Sequences were analyses using Maximum Likelihood method with 11 in-group. 6 interspecies out-group of Thelymitra. and 2 intergeneric out-group of Thelymitrinae subtribe. The result showed that ITS-nrDNA sequences of T. javanica have no variation in nucleotide compositions and showing polytomy branch in cladogram.

A number of studies have focused on patterns and complications of uveitis in the pediatric age group (≤ 16 years). In this report. we studied children with uveitis syndromes focusing on demographics. anatomic distribution. etiologies. treatment. and complications. We additionally divided subjects into two age groups to look into any differential characteristics pertaining to the younger age group and the role of amblyopia as a cause of visual loss. Methods: Retrospective chart review of 80 eyes of 49 uveitis patients aged≤ 16years. Subjects were categorized by age of onset into visually immature (≤ 8 years) and visually mature group (> 8 years). Data compared between the two age groups included demographics. disease characteristics. visual outcomes and complications. Results: Idiopathic uveitis was the most common diagnosis (51%). Anterior uveitis complications (posterior synechiae and band keratopathy) were more common in the younger group (p= 0.002 and p= 0.03 respectively) while posterior uveitis manifestations (vitreous haze and vasculitis) were more common in the older age group (p= 0.04 and p< 0.001 respectively). Amblyopia was the most common cause of vision loss in the visually immature versus cataract in the visually mature.

Some members of the endogenous faecal microflora have a clear detrimental role in most animal models of colitis and enteritis. This is strongly suspected to be the cause of indeterminate colitis. Objective: Determination of humoral immune response and luminal microorganisms in patients with indeterminate colitis. Patients & Methods: The study consisted of two groups: 75 patients groups with indeterminate colitis and control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers. Sigmoidoscope and colonoscope examination were done for the patients group and biopsy were also taken from ulcer lesion for histopathological examination for confirming the diagnosis. Blood samples were collected from them and serum were collected for immunoglobulins (IgG. IgM and IgA) levels and complement (C3 and C4) level by single radial immune diffusion method (Biomaghrib-Tunis). Fecal and rectal swabs were taken from those groups. cultured on different bacteriological media. Results: Males more than females are affected. The majority of them were complaining from rectal bleeding. Most of their diseased location was in rectum then sigmoid and ascending colon.

On buccal and lingual aspects of these teeth conventional class V cavity preparation were done (90 cavities). then randomly divided to 4 groups. three of them had 10 teeth (20 cavities) and one of them had 5 teeth (10 cavities) as control group. Cavities in each experimental group prepared with one of the disinfectants and then 7th generation bonding (Optibond all in one. err) was used as noted by manufacturer. then cavities filled with composite and polished. Bonding agent was used without our previous disinfectants manipulation in control group. Specimens were thermocycled with 1000 thermal cycles between 5 and 550C each for 30 seconds and then immersed in the methylene blue 5%. then sectioned mesiodistally and investigated for microlea age under stereomicroscope (Olympus. Japan). Data were analyzed using Krus al-Wallis and Wilcoxon mean ran tests. Results: Despite the lower mean ran values for the untreated group at both occlusal and gingival aspects. the Krus al-Wallis procedure (α= 0.05) showed that the treatment factor did not significantly affect the mean ran values neither in occlusal (P= 0.12) nor in gingival (P= 0.39) part of cavities.

Taxonomic identification is a first step in ensuring that plants are appropriately adapted to the site. An example of the need to identify taxonomic differences comes from big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata). This species is composed of three predominant subspecies occupying distinct environmental niches. but overlap and hybridization are common in ecotones. Restoration of A. tridentata largely occurs using wildland collected seed. but there is uncertainty in the identification of subspecies or mix of subspecies from seed collections.

1089826,selective Targeting of the l858r Mutation (egFr) in non-small cell lung cancer: a Mechanism for advancing Targeted chemotherapy,2017,Rohan Arora and Venkat Krishnan,7,Frontiers in oncology,,104,Frontiers,Lung cancer remains one of today's most deadly and intractable cancers. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for roughly 85\% of lung cancers. with an extremely poor survival rate. To ensure patient comfort and survival the development of a selective therapy is imperative. However. Lung Cancer does not display surface proteins associated uniquely with tumor cells; thus it is very difficult to develop a tumor-specific drug. Current techniques that target over-expression of proteins or inhibit growth pathways are either non-specific or prone to rapid drug resistance. The goal was to design a drug targeted to structural mutations expressed by tumor-associated general surface proteins. thereby combating the lack of tumor-unique markers in Lung Cancer. Mutant-EGFR was identified as a potential target due to its prominence in tumor cells. Due to their size. it was determined that Small Molecules would be most effective at targeting isolated changes in protein structure. and thereby differentiating between the tumor-associated mutant-EGFR and the healthy wild type. Conformational analysis of a virtual binding study conducted in VINA predicted a set of drug-like small molecules specific for the L858R mutation in EGFR. One molecule (ZN47) was then acquired and conjugated to a carrier protein to form a multifaceted happen-protein conjugate. Multiple ELISAs were conducted to confirm the specificity of the conjugate to both tumor-associated mutant EGFRs. The results indicate that the identified molecule may be highly selective for tumor associated L858R-EGFR. but further research. including a complete dosage binding study. is necessary …,True,XXk-NNQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2017.00104/full,5085294196009472295,/scholar?cites=5085294196009472295,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2017.00104/full,0,0,0

Understanding the spatio-temporal variability in primary productivity and the resulting behavioural responses of native herbivores is essential for the analysis of the vulnerability of savanna ecosystems to climatic and human-induced threats. The Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR). Botswana. is open to free-ranging wildlife to its south and west. The mostly homogeneous dune landscape is interspersed with valley and pan systems. which deviate considerably from dune regions in their soil and vegetation structures. I assessed the phenology of green vegetation across the pan-valley and dune habitats of the northern CKGR. using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. and related variations in greenness to the ecology of gemsbok (Oryx gazella). a herbivore species that is highly adapted to arid conditions. Eight female gemsbok were collared in the northern CKGR. and their patterns of habitat selection and responses to three greenness measures (NDVI. ΔNDVI and Relative Greenness) were assessed using logistic regression models. Gemsbok 12-hour displacement distances for each herd were compared seasonally to assess whether gemsbok in the northern CKGR differ in their movement strategies depending on the prevailing environmental conditions at that point in time and space.

SSD is applied at all transmitting nodes in the secondary network to rotate and interleave the signal components before transmission that enables both source terminals and intermediate relay to transmit different symbols. Therefore. SSD enhances the mutual information of the SSD-based underlay cognitive two-way relay network compared to the conventional one. Thus. performance analysis and results of the proposed system are different than that of the conventional system.

1089855,Structural Characterization of Small basic protein (Sbp) and Accumulation associated protein (Aap): two Proteins involved in Biofilm Formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis,2017,Madiha Fayyaz,,,,,,Staphylococcus epidermidis is a nosocomial pathogen. which infects biotic and abiotic surfaces by forming adherent biofilms. Biofilm is a multilayered microbial community formed by the production of an extracellular matrix. The constituents of extracellular matrix. consisting of proteins. polysaccharides and lipids. regulate different stages of biofilm formation. Once a biofilm is matured. the infection becomes chronic especially in case of implanted medical devices (IMDs). Among many other components of extracellular matrix. small basic protein (Sbp) and accumulation associated protein (Aap) play key roles in biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. Aap consists of two domains A and B. Domain B is reported to be involved in biofilm formation and consists of glycine rich repeats called G5 domains. The genes encoding for Sbp and three G5 domain constructs of Aap domain B (G51E. G51EG52 and G51EG52EG53) were successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli. The concentration dependent non-specific oligomerization/aggregation of purified Sbp was studied in solution. using SAXS after improving the solubility and stability of protein. A low-resolution structure ab initio model of Sbp monomer has been proposed to present its ellipsoidal shape using bead modeling approach by applying the interpretation of SAXS measurements.

The present study aims at evaluating the possible protective effect of β-carotene (βC). as a natural cyanobacterial product. against stress-induced alterations in circadian rhythms of behavioral activities and oxidative markers. Male albino rats were subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 21 days. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (20 rats/group) viz.; control. CUS-exposed. βC-treated and βC-treated+ CUS-exposed groups. One hour before testing. βC extracted from Oscillatoria brevis was administered (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (IP). Elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swimming test (FST) were applied for behavioral assessment. Blood samples were collected at four circadian times (CT 3. 9. 15 and 21); 5 rats/time point. to monitor circadian profiles of nitric oxide (NO). lipid peroxidation (LPO) and glutathione (GSH). Circadian patterns were observed in all tested behavioral and antioxidant parameters. CUS induced anxiety-and depression-like behavior in rats where the immobility time in FST was significantly increased (P< 0.05). whereas the time spent in open arms of EPM was decreased. Data showed that under CUS exposure the peak times (acrophase) of circadian rhythms of NO. LPO and GSH levels as well as immobility time and time spent in open arms were changed. βC improved these changes. CUS significantly increased NO.

In addition. Oscillatoria sp. contain high concentration pattern of β-carotene. as reported by Mohan et al..(2010). Hepato-protective. nephron-protective. anti-diabetes and anticancer effects of βC were reported. Stress may be an environmental. physical and/or psychological stimulus that is capable of altering the physiological homeostasis of the body. and hence it is considered as a crucial determinant in health and disease (Kendler et al.. 1999). Circadian rhythms (CR) are endogenous. about 24-hr oscillations controlling different physiological and behavioral functions of organisms from bacteria to humans. Stress responses and circadian rhythmicity are adaptations to environmental influences. Whereas stress responses are adaptations to unpredictable aspects of the environment. circadian rhythmicity is an adaptation to its predictable aspects. such as light-dark cycles (Buijs and Kalsbeek 2001). The biochemical (Rajasekar et al.. 2004) and hematological parameters (Dridi et al.. 2013) showed marked circadian fluctuations over a 24 hour period related to light-dark cycles in Wistar rats.

This study compared the ability of cyanobacterial β-carotene extract (βC) versus melatonin (M) in modulating the circadian alternations of locomotor activity (LC) and serum M rhythms under chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in rats. Thirty rats (5 rats/group) were used in monitoring LC using running wheels. One hundred and twenty rats (20 rats/group; 5/time point) were used in observing circadian serum M profile. Rats were randomly divided into 6 groups. viz. control. CUS-exposed. βC-treated. M-treated.“βC-treated&CUS-exposed”. and “M-treated&CUS-exposed” groups. CUS-exposure was applied for 21 days. one hour before exposure. βC or M was daily administered (10 mg/kg). intraperitoneally. Blood was sampled at 6-hour intervals (at 3am. 9am. 3pm. and 9pm). The results demonstrated that unstressed rats exhibited normal nocturnal LC rhythm with acrophase around 9pm. and normal M pattern with acrophase at 3am. Both CUS-exposure and M administration significantly (p< 0.05) decreased LC and increased M levels. Additionally. they revealed shifted rhythms in LC and M. Daily βC administration exhibited no change in LC and M rhythms in unstressed and stressed rats.

1089864,Seasonal Variation of Circadian Activity of Rat Measured by Circadian Locomotor Modified Cage,,Menatallah M Mohammed,,,,,,Circadian rhythm variations are related to seasonal photoperiodic variations. which affect animal as well as human physiology and behavior. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of photoperiodic variations on circadian locomotor activity using circadian locomotor modified cages to maintain animals' welfare demands. Twelve male Sprague Dawley rats (140-180g) housed under natural photoluminous periods. Rats were divided into two groups (each. n= 6). summer group (Long photoperiod; GA; LD 14: 10) and winter group (Short photoperiod; GB; LD 11: 13). Circadian locomotor activity rhythm was examined in both groups. Rats were housed individually in circadian locomotor plastic cages with voluntary running wheel. Results revealed that GB rats had significantly (p< 0.05) greater locomotor activity during the day and longer tau than GA rats. Locomotor activity of GB significantly (p< 0.05) decreased compared to GA. Taken together. it could be concluded that the ability of GA rats to entrain to long photoperiod compared to GB. suggests that the photoperiod affects the circadian locomotor rhythm.

They play a vital role in the global ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years. Differences between trees in bark topography can cause different epiphytic variation in community composition. The objectives of this research was to assess the response of number of algal cells towards bark roughness inhabiting 15 standing trees from field collections in the Central Region of Peninsular Malaysia. Putrajaya. Several methods were involved including field sampling. algal quantification. algal identification and physical assessment of the bark roughness. The study showed that trees with rough bark sustained higher density of microalgae (1140±405 cells/ml) compared to the smooth ones (1069±434 cells/ml). The slight differences could be due to other physical parameters such as the degree of slope or inclination of the tree. As a conclusion. this study showed that trees with rough bark surfaces efficiently accumulates the atmospheric pollutants through its fissure and delayed water movement thus sustained more algal cells compared to trees with smooth bark.,True,9cUn0B8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ihsan_Alwi5/publication/329207290_Bark_Roughness_as_a_Factor_Affecting_Cell_Density_of_Epiphytic_Microalgae_Apatococcus_Sp/links/5cb6d6e2a6fdcc1d499a45bc/Bark-Roughness-as-a-Factor-Affecting-Cell-Density-of-Epiphytic-Microalgae-Apatococcus-Sp.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ihsan_Alwi5/publication/329207290_Bark_Roughness_as_a_Factor_Affecting_Cell_Density_of_Epiphytic_Microalgae_Apatococcus_Sp/links/5cb6d6e2a6fdcc1d499a45bc/Bark-Roughness-as-a-Factor-Affecting-Cell-Density-of-Epiphytic-Microalgae-Apatococcus-Sp.pdf,0,0,0

Yogyakarta",,,,Salah satu karakterisktik dari kapasitor adalah adanya resistansi yang dinamakan ESR (equivalent series resistance). Nilai ESR pada kapasitor ini dapat menjadi faktor yang sangat berpengaruh pada unjuk kerja rangkaian dan sistem elektronika. terutama pada sistem catu daya tersaklar (SMPS). Nilai ESR juga dapat menjadi indikator utama dari kondisi kapasitor. Kapasitor yang telah terdegradasi sering masih menunjukkan nilai kapasitansi dalam rentang (range) toleransi dan masih menunjukkan tingkat tegangan listrik yang sesuai. Namun demikian kapasitor ini akan menunjukkan nilai ESR yang jauh lebih tinggi dari rata-rata nilai ESR pada kapasitor yang masih baik pada rating yang sama. Sekalipun merupakan parameter yang penting namun kebanyakan alat pengukur kapasitansi yang dijual di pasaran lokal tidak memiliki kemampuan untuk menguji kondisi ESR pada kapasitor. Selain itu perangkat yang memiliki kemampuan untuk pengukur nilai ESR umumnya berharga relatif mahal. Dalam makalah ini dibahas tentang ESR pada kapasitor (termasuk pengaruhnya terhadap unjuk kerja rangkaian) dan adaptasi terhadap rancangan asli dari alat penguji ESR kapasitor. Pengaruh nilai ESR pada rangkaian SMPS ditunjukkan melalui simulasi dengan LTspice. Adaptasi rancangan penguji ESR kapasitor dilakukan agar peralatan yang praktis dapat direalisasikan dengan menggunakan komponen yang umum tersedia secara lokal.

Compared to mineral fertilizers. organic by-products deriving from livestock. industrial and municipal sources. are less expensive and can contribute to climate change mitigation through C sequestration [1-3]. Organic fertilization addresses the rising cost of mineral fertilizers. waste management issues and promotes circular economy. Sugarcane cropping is a good candidate for organic fertilization. Nevertheless. little is known about greenhouse gas (GHG) production from soils receiving both organic fertilizers with variable physicochemical structure and the quantity of crop residues. We aimed to investigate (i) nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitisol. fertilized with liquid pig manure (LPM). solid sewage sludge (SS) and urea (U). and (ii) the potential mineralization interactions between sugarcane mulch quantity and these N sources.,True,6-R4J7EAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zenon_Hamkalo2/publication/305787439_Quantification_of_Labile_Nitrogen_in_Soil_under_Different_Fertilization_Regimes_P_428-429/links/57a1c87608ae5f8b258a151d/Quantification-of-Labile-Nitrogen-in-Soil-under-Different-Fertilization-Regimes-P-428-429.pdf#page=124,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zenon_Hamkalo2/publication/305787439_Quantification_of_Labile_Nitrogen_in_Soil_under_Different_Fertilization_Regimes_P_428-429/links/57a1c87608ae5f8b258a151d/Quantification-of-Labile-Nitrogen-in-Soil-under-Different-Fertilization-Regimes-P-428-429.pdf#page=124,0,0,0

In this study. the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene was selected for the molecular identification of D. koenigii and D. cingulatus. The sequence data showed that one species of the red cotton bug sample was identified as Dysdercus koenigii with 35-100% similarity to other Dysdercus species present in the NCBI database. while the other species was identified as Dysdercus cingulatus with 88-94% similarity to other red cotton bugs species present in the NCBI database. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that our D. koenigii Seq (> 180319003-A02-102-DK-. ab1) shares the same cluster with four D. koenigii isolates (ZSI/SRC_I. 28B. ZSI/SRC_I. 28. GQ306227. 1. KJ459924. 1). While the D. cingulatus Seq (> 180319003-A02-103-DC-. abl) shares a cluster with D. cingulatus voucher (RO_DC2015). This is the first molecular identification of red cotton bugs (D. koenigii and D. cingulatus) reported in Pakistan. Thus. in the current study. molecular identification has been accepted as a reliable method for the identification of these agriculturally important insect pests.,True,8Njra-4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,http://aes.bio.bg.ac.rs/index.php/aes/article/view/276,2145785887847542076,/scholar?cites=2145785887847542076,,https://aes.bio.bg.ac.rs/index.php/aes/article/download/276/433,0,0,0

Calculations are performed with the united-atom Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE) force field and compared against available experimental data. TraPPE was found to provide reliable qualitative predictions of trends with respect to the effect of fluorination on partitioning.

To characterize how environmental variation impacts cave ice microbial community structure. we determined the composition of total and potentially active bacterial communities along a 13.000 year-old ice core from Scarisoara cave (Romania) through 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. An average of 2.546 prokaryotic gDNA operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 585 cDNA OTUs were identified across the perennial cave ice block and analyzed in relation to the geochemical composition of ice layers. The total microbial community and the putative active fraction displayed dissimilar taxa profiles. The ice-contained microbiome was dominated by Actinobacteria with a variable representation of Proteobacteria. while the putative active microbial community was equally shared between Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Accordingly. a major presence of Cryobacterium. Lysinomonas. Pedobacter and Aeromicrobium phylotypes homologous to psychrotrophic and psychrophilic bacteria from various cold environments were noted in the total community. while the prevalent putative active bacteria belonged to Clostridium.

In comparison with mesophilic and thermophilic homologues. the amino acid sequence of the catalytic subunit of this cold-active enzyme was characterized by the complete absence of cysteine residues. a reduced incidence of glutamate and lysine and a higher representation of aspartate and arginine residues. alongside a higher content of coils in the secondary structure. Moreover. a major difference in the distribution of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic clusters along the psychrophilic enzyme was observed as compared to mesophilic and hyperthermophilic counterparts. Comparison of the G. superstes ATCase sequence with that of the psychrophilic Cryobacterium sp. corroborated the proposed cold adaptation pattern.

1090001,Fluctuating asymmetry as an indicator of ecological stress in Rhinocypha colorata (Odonata: Chlorocyphidae) in Iligan City. Mindanao. Philippines,2016,Cherry Mae M Yuto and Leonel Lumogdang and RM Tabugo,3,Entomol. Appl. Sci. Lett,,13-20,,Odonata species are known to be successful biological indicators because they are particularly sensitive to human disturbances due to their habitat selection which makes them vulnerable to changes. A useful trait to monitor developmental instability (DI) and ecological stress is fluctuating asymmetry (FA). which is a measure of the differences between the left and right side of bilateral symmetrical organisms. It refers to a slight number and nondirectional deviations from strict bilateral symmetry of biological objects that occur as a result of stochastic microscopic processes. In this study. fore-wing variation of Rhinocypha colorata. a Philippine endemic species was investigated. It assessed developmental stability via fluctuating asymmetry in the fore-wings of R. colorata. in three populations from three areas: Buruun. Ditucalan. Dalipuga. Iligan City. Mindanao. Philippines. Analysis was based on Procrustes method that makes comparison of FA indices of homologous points. Using landmark method for shape asymmetry. anatomical landmarks were used and analyzed using Symmetry and Asymmetry in Geometric Data (SAGE) program. Twenty landmarks on the fore-wings were tested on samples for all populations. Results obtained showed variation and significantly high FA for all populations with relatively higher FA for Dalipuga. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that barangay Dalipuga exhibited more variations (74.93%) than that of Ditucalan (72.19%) and Buru-un (67.97%). Possible reasons behind high FA values were anthropogenic activities in the area.

Ser.) is an ornamental species with great market potential. It is known for its ability to change the colour of its inflorescence. according to the pH of the culture substrate. The molecular mechanisms that underlie these changes are still unclear. It is known that epigenetic mechanisms. such as DNA methylation. play an important role in genetic expression. so they could be responsible for this phenomenon in hydrangea. In the present study. the molecular markers ISSR (Inter Simple Sequence Repeat) and MSAP (Methyl-Sensitive Amplification Polymorphism) were used to detect molecular changes in the genome of hydrangea plants that were cultivated under different pH levels to modify the colour of the sepals. The results showed a correspondence between the methylation signal measured with MSAP and amplification ISSR patterns when compared before and after the modification of pH culture substrates. These results suggest that DNA methylation might be involved as a molecular mechanism underlying the colour change of hydrangea sepals in response to a differential pH in the substrate. In addition. the results pave the way to study the relationship between DNA methylation and ISSR marker profiles.

Anthropogenic activities perturbed its natural habitats and threaten its survival. At present time. there is not enough information about the genetic relationships and structure among Z. fosteri distributed in Mexico. The objective of this investigation was to elucidate the genetic relationships and structure among accessions of Z. fosteri collected in western and southeastern Mexico. ISSR markers were used to establish the genetic variability and genetic structure among 60 accessions randomly collected in western Mexico and one population found in southeastern Mexico. Jaccard’s coefficient and AMOVA analysis determined the similarity and variability among and within accessions. and Bayesian model was used to assess the genetic structure. A mean heterozygosity of 0.49 was found indicated a moderate variability. The AMOVA analysis showed that 75% of this variability was within accessions. and 25% among accessions.

SM imaging may rely on proteins or nucleic acids labelled with a fluorophore. Unfortunately photobleaching of fluorophores leads to irreversible loss of signal. impacting the collection of data from SM experiments. Trace amounts of dissolved oxygen (O2) are the main cause of photobleaching. Oxygen scavenging systems (OSS) have been developed that decrease dissolved O2. Commercial OSS enzyme preparations are frequently contaminated with nucleases that damage nucleic acid substrates. In this protocol. we purify highly active Pseudomonas putida protocatechuate 3.4-dioxygenase (PCD) without nuclease contaminations.

In this review. we focus on the ability of the ECM to regulate the biological activity of BMPs. In particular. we survey the role of the ECM components. notably the glycosaminoglycans and fibrillary ECM proteins. which can be promoters or repressors of the biological activities mediated by the BMPs. We examine how a process called mechano-transduction induced by the ECM can affect BMP signaling. including BMP internalization by the cells. We also focus on the spatio-temporal regulation of the BMPs. including their release from the ECM. which enables to modulate their spatial localization as well as their local concentration.

1090023,Presentation of bone morphogenetic proteins to cells at their basal side reveals their role in the initiation of cell adhesion,,Adrià Sales and Paul Machillot and Laure Fourel and Amaris Guevara and Elisa Migliorini and Corinne Albigès-Rizo and Catherine Picart,,,,,,There is a need to develop new biomaterials with tunable physico-chemical properties for the regeneration of large bone defects in vivo by inducing stem cell differentiation to bone cells. In particular. the use of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in combination with biomaterials offers promising possibilities in view of the key role of these proteins in bone regeneration [1]. Our team has already developed a thin biomimetic coating of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film made of hyaluronic acid (HA) and poly-L-lysine (PLL). which enables to physically trap the BMPs and present them to cells in a matrix-bound manner [2]. meaning that the cells perceive the biochemical signal at their ventral (or basal) side and internalize the BMPs [3]. Biomaterials presenting BMP proteins in a matrix-bound manner enable to reveal so far hidden biological phenomena. notably a crosstalk between BMP receptors and adhesion receptors of the integrin family [4]. More specifically. we showed that BMP-2 physically bound to soft films induced cell adhesion and spreading through a cross-talk between integrin β3 and BMP receptor IA [4]. Recently. we developed an automated liquid handling system to deposit the layer-by-layer films in multiple well cell culture microplates. We showed using 96-well plates that the biomimetic film coatings are reproducible with> 93% homogeneity inside each microwell and between microwells [5]. Taking advantage of the high throughput automated system to deposit the biomimetic films in a reproducible manner. we thought to study the effect of different matrix-bound BMPs on early cell adhesion and spreading. especially cell number and …,True,ZrXBOmYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,http://nonlineaire.univ-lille1.fr/GDR3070/media/Manifestations/2018/Contributions/Abstract_GDRCellTiss_ASales.pdf,,,,http://nonlineaire.univ-lille1.fr/GDR3070/media/Manifestations/2018/Contributions/Abstract_GDRCellTiss_ASales.pdf,0,0,0

Microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of newborn mammals are derived. at least in part. from the maternal microbial population. Milk-derived microbiota is an important source of this microbial inocula and we hypothesized that the maternal diet contributes to variation in this microbial community. To evaluate the relationship between a mother’s diet and milk microbiome. we fed female rats a low-or high-protein diet and mated all individuals. Milk and cecal contents were collected from dams at peak lactation (14-day post-partum). and the bacterial composition of each community was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our findings revealed higher dietary protein intake decreased fecal microbial diversity but increased milk microbial and pup cecum diversity. Further. the higher dietary protein intake resulted in a greater abundance of potentially health-promoting bacteria. such as Lactobacillus spp. These data suggest that dietary protein levels contribute to significant shifts in the composition of maternal milk microbiota and that the functional consequences of these changes in microbial inocula might be biologically important and should be further explored.

1090038,Evaluation of Dietary Vitamin D3 on Physiology and Vitamin D Metabolism in Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) Model,2020,MF Warren,,,,,,WARREN. MATTHEW FRANCIS. Evaluation of Dietary Vitamin D3 on Physiology and Vitamin D Metabolism in Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) Model.(Under the direction of Dr. Kimberly A. Livingston).Dietary cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is important for calcium absorption for bone mineralization; however. vitamin D also has other metabolic functions relating to physiology. Vitamin D3 is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stored in adipose tissue and other tissues such as the kidneys. Considering there are different vitamin D3 metabolites that circulate through bloodstream and are functionally important for vitamin D metabolism. vitamin D can be considered a hormone. Vitamin D fortification in food. supplementation. and synthetics are three ways that humans can increase vitamin D intake without increasing sunlight exposure. Knowledge pertaining to vitamin D toxicity as a result of vitamin D supplementation is not well known. In poultry. vitamin D is nutritionally important for bone structure. eggshell quality and is also deposited in the egg yolk. Vitamin D’s nutritional function was also discovered using poultry as a model where vitamin D deficiency was observed to cause rickets in chicks. Examining how extreme dosage of vitamin D or synthetic vitamin D influence physiologic status in poultry has powerful implications to elucidate potential effects that need to be taken into considerations for human therapeutic treatments.

D3 exhibits hormonal traits and is responsible for calcium (Ca) absorption. 1-α-hydroxycholecalciferol (1α) is a synthetic form of D3 that has equal efficacy and is cheaper to synthesize than 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (active form of D3). on broilers. However. 1α bypasses a critical regulatory point. the kidney. and may consequently lead to toxicity levels of Ca via Ca absorption. This study examined 1α supplementation in broiler diets with different Ca inclusion levels to determine if 1α at higher Ca levels caused Ca toxicity at starter and grower phases with Ross 708 male broiler chicks. In Experiment 1 (1-15 d of age). chicks were assigned to one of ten treatment starter diets with five levels of Ca inclusion (0.80. 0.95. 1.10. 1.25. and 1.40%) with or without 1α supplementation (5 µg 1α /kg in feed) and 8 replicate cages per treatment. In Experiment 2. chicks were fed common starter diet until 16 d of age. then they were assigned to one of eight treatment diets with four levels of Ca inclusion (0.54. 0.76. 0.98. or 1.20%) with or without 1α supplementation (5 µg 1α /kg in feed). At the end of both experiments. blood was collected from broilers to determine blood chemistry. including concentrations of vitamin D metabolites. Intestinal tissues were also collected to examine gene expression. In Experiment 1. broilers not fed 1α exhibited a quadratic effect in ionized blood Ca (iCa) as dietary Ca inclusion levels increased; 1α-fed broilers displayed an increase in iCa as Ca inclusion levels increased (p = 0.0002 …,True,vqatVBcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00245/pdf,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00245/pdf,0,0,0

Warren,,,,,,Microorganisms in milk have traditionally been assumed to be contaminants. but recent data suggest that these microbial communities naturally reside in milk and may contribute to vital maternal effects. Investigators have speculated that microorganisms are derived. at least in part. from populations of microorganisms found in a mother’s gut. Milk microorganisms are ingested by offspring gut and contribute to the microbial populations that colonize the offspring gut. Thus. factors that impact the population of microorganisms in milk have implications for advancing knowledge of how mothers influence offspring development. In this case. females are likely preparing offspring for a similar dietary environment at independence.

The centrifuged cells produce three times more TAGs than those cultured in a nitrogen (N) depletion condition in the first 24 h. The chloroplast membranes of the centrifuged cells are largely disrupted. In addition. the accumulated TAGs contain only trivial amount of C18:1 (11) and C18:3 (5.9.12) fatty acids that are more abundant in TAGs accumulated under N-starved condition. Overall. TAGs that are induced by centrifugation contain more saturated fatty acids than that induced by N starvation. These suggest that the centrifugation triggers the production of TAGs through yet unknown mechanism. An importance of this finding is that not only quantity but also quality of the TAG production can be modified by alternating environmental stimuli rather than genetic means.,True,HfTNUwwAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589014X18301014,3164809179384519284,/scholar?cites=3164809179384519284,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yonghua_Li-Beisson/publication/328238283_Centrifugation-induced_production_of_triacylglycerols_in_Chlamydomonas_reinhardtii/links/5c617aba299bf1d14cbcb024/Centrifugation-induced-production-of-triacylglycerols-in-Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii.pdf,0,0,0

Artemisia fruits were used in this study. they had been dried and grinded then some chemical analyses were done to determine the active compounds of the fruits in both hot and cold extract. Since our results shows that the hot extract has more active compounds from the cold. the hot extract of Artemisia L. fruit were used in this study to determine the efficacy of it as diabetic treatment in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Streptozocin (STZ) was used to induce diabetes in 35 mice which divided to 5 groups. One group consumed normal saline while the other four consumed Artemisia with four different concentrations. Another 10 mice weren’t injected with STZ which were they had been divided to two groups; one consumed Artemisia and the other consumed normal saline. The fasting blood sugar (FBS) was determined on different period; zero time. 7 and 14 days after treatment. The mice were scarified and blood was collected. Insulin. GOT and GPT levels were determine in serum. FBS was higher in all STZ-induced diabetic mice dropped to normal after 14 days. The FBS of mice. treated with 500 Artemisia/kg mice. was closer to control. Insulin level was lower in STZ-induce diabetic mice without treatment raised to normal after treatment with 500 and 1000 mg Artemisia/kg mice. Same results were found for GOT and GPT levels. As conclusion. Artemisia appears to be a good modulator for diabetes especially at 500 and 1000 mg Artemisia/kg body weight.,True,ler2M5sAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://www.journal.atmph-specialissues.org/uploads/179/7257_pdf.pdf,,,,https://www.journal.atmph-specialissues.org/uploads/179/7257_pdf.pdf,0,0,0

This issue concerns both human and veterinary medicine and can only be solved by a multidisciplinary approach. A comprehensive concept is. therefore. being worked out within the StAR (strategy antibiotic resistance) program in order to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for humans as well as animals. In this context. the AntibioticScout (www.AntibioticScout. ch) offers a new online tool for the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine. By involving all stakeholders. the guidelines included in the AntibioticScout will result in a nationwide accepted standard for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals. An additional system for the rapid reporting of cases of suspected lack of efficacy of antimicrobials is integrated to allow early detection of emerging resistance and the immediate launch of risk mitigation measures. A first version of the AntibioticScout for the treatment of dogs. cats and horses is available by the end of 2016.

European countries banned the misuse of antimicrobials as growth promoters. but it is recognized that their remaining widespread application for the prevention and treatment of diseases in farm as well as companion animals is a main driver of antibiotic resistance. A primary concern is that the antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine contributes to reduce efficacies in humans. Cases of transmission of acquired resistances from animals to humans have been described. although the importance and extent of this resistance spread has yet to be quantified. Another concern is the increasing antibiotic resistance detected in zoonotic bacteria. but the potential for transmissions extends to commensals and opportunistic bacteria. These issues are further aggravated by the fact that many antimicrobials used in veterinary …,True,jSPRbhMAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,0,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0037-1608012,,,,,0,0,0

All members of the Association for Ruminant Health were contacted per e-mail. The survey was completed by 108 (28%) of 393 that were contacted. According to the questionnaire responses. the typical presentation of a parturient paresis cow is a pluriparous middle-yielding dairy cow one day post-partum in sternal recumbency with normal consciousness. The diagnosis is usually based upon the medical history. Therapy of parturient paresis consists of mixed infusions (with calcium. phosphorus. magnesium or glucose) as well as oral preparations with calcium. The veterinarians estimate that 25-50% of the cows treated for parturient paresis need more than one treatment and that one case of parturient paresis costs CHF 200-300. Prophylactic treatments are usually used for cows. which have suffered from parturient paresis in the previous lactation. elder cows (≥ 3 lactations) as well as cows with a high body condition score (> 3.25). Prophylactic measures used by the veterinarians are vitamin D3 injections and oral preparations with calcium.

Many genomic comparisons. especially those regarding the accessory genome that is variably conserved across strains in a species. are performed using assembled genomes. For completed genomes. an assumption is made that the entire genome was incorporated into the genome assembly. while for draft assemblies. often constructed from short sequence reads. an assumption is made that genome assembly is an approximation of the entire genome. To understand the potential effects of short read assemblies on the estimation of the complete genome. we downloaded all completed bacterial genomes from GenBank. simulated short reads. assembled the simulated short reads and compared the resulting assembly to the completed assembly. Although most simulated assemblies demonstrated little reduction. others were reduced by as much as 25%. which was correlated with the repeat structure of the genome. A comparative analysis of lost coding region sequences demonstrated that up to 48 CDSs or up to ~112.000 bases of coding region sequence. were missing from some draft assemblies compared to their finished counterparts. Although this effect was observed to some extent in 32% of genomes. only minimal effects were observed on pan-genome statistics when using simulated draft genome assemblies. The benefits and limitations of using draft genome assemblies should be fully realized before interpreting data from assembly-based comparative analyses.,True,FXD4ToEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/091314v1.abstract,4031491657969181964,/scholar?cites=4031491657969181964,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/12/03/091314.full.pdf,0,0,0

In many legume species. differentiation of the endosymbiotic bacteria is irreversible. culminating in definitive loss of their cell division ability. This terminal differentiation is mediated by plant peptides produced in the symbiotic cells. In Medicago truncatula more than ∼700 nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides are involved in this process. We have shown previously that NCR247 and NCR335 have strong antimicrobial activity on various pathogenic bacteria and identified interaction of NCR247 with many bacterial proteins. including FtsZ and several ribosomal proteins. which prevent bacterial cell division and protein synthesis. In this study we designed and synthetized various derivatives of NCR247. including shorter fragments and various chimeric derivatives.

We previously demonstrated that chronic pain after spinal cord injury results from central sensitization in the posterior thalamus (PO).

We previously demonstrated that chronic pain after spinal cord injury results from central sensitization in the posterior thalamus (PO). The presence of persistent headaches and back pain in veterans with blast-TBI suggests a similar involvement of thalamic sensitization. Here. we tested the hypothesis that pain after blast-TBI is associated with abnormal increases in activity of neurons in PO thalamus.

Three weeks after blast-TBI. rats developed persistent. ongoing spontaneous pain. Contrary to our hypothesis. we found no significant differences in the activity of PO neurons. or of neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. There were also no significant changes in gliosis in either of these structures.

We observed the behaviour of 20 rats in four groups of five. spending 2 nights each (40 trials) in large observation pens. In only 10 of 40 trials did the rat run through a tunnel without hesitation on first encounter. while in four trials a rat approached the tunnel up to 35 times but refused to run though it all night. Most rats approached and turned away between two and 34 times before running through. Observations through transparent tunnels of rats pausing for a mean of 3.2 s before stepping on the ink suggest that they probably could detect it. but they usually chose to ignore it. Experience of encountering the ink pad inside a black tunnel did not deter rats from running across another one. and would not affect indices of rat abundance reaching levels high enough to trigger conservation concern. but …,True,7Zm15aYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03014223.2017.1361455,8338213134773288412,/scholar?cites=8338213134773288412,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carolyn_King4/publication/319273075_Do_rats_mind_getting_their_feet_dirty_Observing_the_behaviour_of_ship_rats_Rattus_rattus_towards_footprint_tracking_tunnels/links/5e3f8736a6fdccd96593065b/Do-rats-mind-getting-their-feet-dirty-Observing-the-behaviour-of-ship-rats-Rattus-rattus-towards-footprint-tracking-tunnels.pdf,0,0,0

However. studies to date have largely examined single pairwise interactions. limiting our understanding of the interplay among different types of interactions and whether indirect impacts systematically favour native or exotic species. Predicting indirect interaction strength has also proven challenging. and it remains unclear whether the strengths of different indirect interactions are correlated.

However. short-term ecological studies of host-parasite systems. on which such studies are usually based. provide only snap-shots of what may be dynamic systems. We report here on four surveys. carried out over a period of 12 years. of helminths of spiny mice (Acomys dimidiatus). the numerically dominant rodents inhabiting dry montane wadis in the Sinai Peninsula. With host age (age-dependent effects on prevalence and abundance were prominent) and sex (female bias in abundance in helminth diversity and in several taxa including Cestoda) taken into consideration. we focus on the relative importance of temporal and spatial effects on helminth infracommunities. We show that site of capture is the major determinant of prevalence and abundance of species (and higher taxa) contributing to helminth community structure. the only exceptions being Streptopharaus spp. and Dentostomella kuntzi. We provide evidence that most (notably the Spiruroidea. Protospirura muricola. Mastophorus muris and Gongylonema aegypti. but with exceptions among the Oxyuroidae. e.g. Syphacia minuta). show elements of temporal-site stability. with a rank order of measures among sites remaining similar over successive surveys.

1090093,Phylogeography of two Sulawesi rodents: testing the effect of climatic variation on population structure,2016,RALPH WAINER and ADRI ROBERT,,,,,,In order to support effective conservation and sustainable land management. it is important to understand the population structure and rates of population differentiation in lesser-known species. Biogeographers. evolutionary biologists and ecologist share an interest in learning about patterns of species diversity. and the identification of such a pattern (e.g. the effects of Pleistocene glacial cycles) can help predict levels of diversity according to the most likely evolutionary history of a species. A phylogenetic study focusing on the population genetics and phylogeography of two sympatric Indonesian murids (Maxomys hellwaldi & Bunomys andrewsi) was performed on different populations on the islands of Sulawesi and Buton. Indicators for population differentiation due to genetic structure were calculated using RAD-tagged Illumina sequencing data. Phylogenetic consensus trees were created using BEAST and MrBayes and dated on the basis of published references. Two hypotheses were tested. firstly that the putative populations are cryptic species. secondly that a defined geological event equally affected the evolutionary biology of both species of interest. A significant amount of differentiation was found between populations of each species on the different islands over a small geographic range. It was concluded that island colonisations during the early Pleistocene associated with the Pliocene to Pleistocene transition and its impact on sea level had resulted in incipient speciation in each genus in parallel.,True,bEhgCDAAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11531/,16558300450297462489,/scholar?cites=16558300450297462489,,http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11531/1/Durham_MScR_Thesis_-_Ralph_Wainer.pdf,0,0,0
1090094,Consequences of environmental DNA pooling,2020,Ralph Wainer and Hayley Ridgway and Eirian Jones and Duane Peltzer and Ian Dickie,,Authorea Preprints,,,Authorea,DNA-based techniques are increasingly used to assess biodiversity both above- and belowground. Most effort has focussed on bioinformatics and sample collection. whereas less is known about the consequences of mixing collected environmental DNA (eDNA). post-extraction and pre-PCR. We applied varying degrees of pooling to stand-alone eDNA samples collected across a non-native plant invasion density gradient. and compared the fungal communities of pooled and unpooled samples. Pooling soil eDNA decreased observable fungal rarefied richness in our samples. led to phylum-specific shifts in proportional abundance. and increased the sensitivity of detection for the invasive plant’s overall impact on fungal diversity. We demonstrate that pooling fungal eDNA could change the outcome of similar eDNA studies where the aim is to: 1) identify the rare biosphere within a soil community. 2) estimate species richness and proportional abundance. or 3) assess the impact of an invasive plant on soil fungi. Sample pooling might be appropriate when determining larger-scale overarching responses of soil communities. as pooling increased the sensitivity of measurable effects of an invasive plant on soil fungal diversity.,True,bEhgCDAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.160322420.00370962,,,,https://www.authorea.com/doi/pdf/10.22541/au.160322420.00370962,0,0,0
1090095,Soil legacy and fungal community responses to Cytisus scoparius invasion.,2020,Ralph Wainer,,,,,University of Canterbury,The goal of my thesis was to study the effects of soil under various levels of invasive Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and then examine whether the unique soil legacy of C. scoparius was contingent on how C. scoparius shaped soil fungal communities.  I began my research by studying the effect of the soil legacy of C. scoparius in a controlled environment (via a greenhouse experiment; Chapter 2). Knowing the effect of the soil legacy of C. scoparius under regulated conditions. I then undertook a field survey (via a natural experiment; Chapter 3). in which I systematically recorded changes in fungal community composition across a natural density gradient of C. scoparius invasion. I subsequently investigated whether the environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding techniques I applied throughout my natural survey could be optimised for future researchers (via a methodological experiment; Chapter 4). Lastly. I analysed how different fungal communities found near C. scoparius may underlie the results of my greenhouse experiment (via mixed-effect modelling; Chapter 5).  In Chapter 2. I found contrary to my hypothesis that the effects of soil extracted under various levels of C. scoparius invasion favoured the growth of native New Zealand plants over its own taxonomic family in a controlled greenhouse environment. Given that the predominantly positive soil legacy of C. scoparius could only be partly attributed to soil chemical traits. microbial effects likely played an underlying role in the invasion success of C. scoparius. In Chapter 3. I found that fungal diversity in soil under C. scoparius was unexpectedly higher than in grassland uninvaded by C …,True,bEhgCDAAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/101157,,,,https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/101157/Wainer%2C%20Ralph_Final%20PhD%20Thesis.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The biology of this disease in this age group is poorly understood. and there are conflicting data regarding the prognosis of these women compared to older patients. We retrospectively analyzed 204 consecutive primary invasive breast cancer patients who underwent surgical procedures at our institution between 1990 and 2002. The younger age group was defined as patients aged< 35 years at the time of diagnosis. The clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes were compared between younger and older age groups.A total of 51 (12.5%) patients were aged< 35. there was a significantly higher incidence of nuclear grade 3 and medullary histological-type tumors in younger patients compared to older patients. Axillary lymph node status. T stage. histological grade. and estrogen receptor status did not differ significantly between the two age groups. Younger patients had a greater probability of recurrence and death at all time periods. Although there was no significant difference in disease-free survival between the two age groups in lymph node-positive patients. the younger group showed worse prognosis among lymph node-positive patients (p< 0.001). in multivariate analysis. younger age remained a significant predictor of recurrence (p= 0.010).

1090131,Honey Bee Virus Transmission via Hive Products,2020,Dominik Schittny and Orlando Yañez and Peter Neumann,7,Veterinary sciences,3,96,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The global trade of honey bee hive products has raised concern about pathogen transmission. However. the efficacy of hive products as virus vehicles is poorly understood. Here. we investigated the transmission capacity of hive products for Deformed wing virus genotype A (DWV-A) in a fully-crossed hoarding cage experiment and estimated the transmission risk by screening commercial products. Western honey bee workers were provided with honey. pollen and wax either contaminated with high (~ 2× 10 9). medium (~ 1.7× 10 8). low (~ 8× 10 6) or zero (control) DWV-A genome copies. For 10 days. mortality was monitored. Then. virus titers were quantified in bee heads and 38 commercial products using RT-qPCR. For honey and pollen. a positive association between DWV-A concentration and mortality was observed. High concentrations always resulted in infections. medium ones in 47% of cases and low ones in 20% of cases. No significant difference was observed between the tested products. In commercial honey and pollen. 7.7× 10 2–1.8× 10 5 and 1.4× 10 3–1.3× 10 4 DWV-A copies per gram were found. respectively. The results show that DWV-A transmission via hive products is feasible.

The rise in antibiotic resistance calls for novel approaches to treat bacterial diseases. Anti-virulence strategies promote a natural way of pathogen clearance by eliminating the advantage provided to bacteria by their virulence factors. In contrast to antibiotics. anti-virulence agents are less likely to exert selective evolutionary pressure. which is a prerequisite for the development of drug resistance. As part of their virulence mechanism. many bacterial pathogens secrete cytolytic exotoxins (hemolysins) that destroy the host cell by destabilizing their plasma membrane. Liposomal nanotraps. mimicking plasmalemmal structures of host cells that are specifically targeted by bacterial toxins are being developed in order to neutralize-by competitive sequestration-numerous exotoxins.

1090133,Regulation and Function of Pancreatic Glucagon in Correlation with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,,Dominik Schittny and Daniel Schümperli,,,,,,In type 1 diabetes mellitus. the pancreatic islet β‐cells of Langerhans are destroyed by an autoimmune reaction. The complete lack of insulin leads to lethal hyperglycemia. To prevent this effect. type 1 diabetes mellitus is treated by insulin infusions in the adipose tissue so far. But such insulin infusions alone cannot restore the disorder of pancreatic secretory products. Therefore. it is most important to understand the mechanisms and interactions going on in the endocrine pancreas. In type 1 diabetes mellitus patients. glucagon production is too high due to the lack of insulin. which in healthy subjects suppresses the action of pancreatic α‐cells. That is why recent studies focus on an accurate glucagon control as a starting point for future treatments. This goal can be reached either by α‐cell inhibitors reducing glucagon secretion or by influencing glucagon receptors to regulate the action of glucagon.

1090151,Menaquinone-4 effects on working memory impairment and anxiety behavior after transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in male wistar rat,2019,Bahram Farhadi Moghaddam and Masoud Fereidoni,,,,,,Background and Objective: Working memory impairment and anxiety behavior could be induced by transient global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (TGCI) as one model of brain stroke. Menaquinone 4 (MK-4) is an antioxidant and anti-inflammation known as vitamin K2. This investigation questioned the effects of MK-4 on the mentioned cognitive impairments following TGCI. Materials and Methods: 28 male wistar rats were randomly selected and divided in 4 groups: sham-control. TGCI. TGCI+ DMSO (1% v/v). TGCI+ MK-4. Immediately and also 2 hours after reperfusion. 200mg/kg MK-4 were injected intraperitonially. 7 days later rats were examined using Y maze and also open field apparatus to evaluate working memory sufficiency and the level of anxiety behavior. respectively. Results: TGCI could reduce spontaneous alternation compared with the sham-control group significantly (p< 0.01). But MK-4 increase percentage of spontaneous alternation compare to TGCI and TGCI+ DMSO (p< 0.05). Rats in TGCI+ DMSO and TGCI groups spent significantly less time in the center zone of open field apparatus compared to sham-control group which can be interpreted as the elevation of anxiety behavior (p< 0.001). But the time spent in the center zone was significantly increased in TGCI+ MK-4 group compare with injured groups (p< 0.001). Conclusion: Results showed that MK-4 could improve working memory (short-term memory) and also reduced anxiety behavior after TGCI.

1090152,The effect of intraperitoneal administration of vitamin K2 on thermal and chemical pain following global cerebral ischemia in male Wistar rats,2018,Sahar Talaei and Masoud Fereidoni and Bahram Farhadi Moghaddam and Daniel Ramandi,,,,,,Background and Aim: According to the world health organization (WHO). Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Stroke is the lack of sufficient blood flow to the brain tissue. Reduction of oxygen in the brain tissue. leads to impairment in mitochondrial function and production of free radicals. Adverse effects of elevated oxidative stress is a decrease in glutamate absorption that may cause increases in pain perception. Vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin. easily crosses the blood brain barrier. and increases the activity of glutamate carriers on astrocytes and clearance of glutamate. This assumption amplifies that administration of vitamin K2 following ischemia has negative effect on feeling of pain. The purpose of this research was to investigate the truth of this assumption. Methods: Male rats weighing 200-280g. were randomly divided into 5 groups (n= 5): control. sham surgery (without carotid arteries occlusion). ischemia (carotid arteries closure for 20 minutes). ischemia+ solvent (DMSO% 0.1) and ischemia+ vitamin K2 (1mg/kg). Vitamin K2 was injected during reperfusion and one hour after reperfusion. This process was repeated for ischemia+ solvent. Five days after reperfusion. thermal pain was measured by tail flick and chemical pain was evaluated by the Formalin test. Results: Results showed threshold of thermal pain significantly decreased in ischemia compared to the control (p< 0.001). Ischemia showed an increase in response to the pain in first phase of formalin test compared to the control (p< 0.05). Vitamin K2 didn’t show any significant effect in both tests.

1090153,The effect of vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-4) on the cognitive impairments and anxiety in transient cerebral global Ischemia,2018,Sogand Alsadat Ghiasi and Masoud Fereidoni and Bahram Farhadi Moghaddam and Daniel Ramandi,,,,,,Background and Aim: Cerebral Ischemia is the second cause of fatality and the first cause of long-term disability in Iran. Based on statistics. every 5 minutes one person will face cerebral ischemia. In practice. stroke refers to a series of conditions caused by the occlusion or haemorrhage of blood vessels supplying the brain. which involves death and dysfunction of brain cells and neurological deficits. Vitamin K is a family of fat-soluble vitamins composed of naphthoquinone ring and a variable aliphatic chain that distinguishes two naturally occurring forms: vitamin K1 (Phylloquinone) and vitaminK2 (Menaquinone). Vit K2 is believed to prevent oxidative stress which is one of the causes of cell death in multiple disorders of the brain including Ischemia. This research is to investigate the effect of intraperitoneal injection of vitamin K2 on object recognition memory and anxiety in ischemic rats. Methods: The adult Wistar male rats (200-250 gr) were randomly divided into four groups (n= 5): Control. Ischemia.

1090154,Evaluating the effect of chronic Ceftriaxone treatment on the learning and memory of rat model of global ischemia,2018,Daniel Ramandi and Bahram Farhadi Moghaddam and Masoud Fereidoni,,,,,,Ischemic stroke is the second most common cause of death around the world. It can seriously cause defects of cognitive processes. To assess the effect of Ceftriaxone treatment on the learning and memory of ischemic rats. we used Morris water maze task. 20 rats were randomly asigned to 3 groups. each containing 5-8 rats. 1. Sham operated controls were anesthetized and received sham operation along with 6 ip administration of vehicle (Saline); 2. Global ischemia (rats were anesthetized and 2 common carotid art. were clamped for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion after clamp removal); 3. Ceftriaxone treatment (Ischemia operation described earlier followed by 6 daily ip administration of Ceftriaxone 200 mg/kg). Our results concerning escape latency and distance travelled showed that Global ischemia can deteriorate spatial learning and reversal learning in morris water maze. Ceftriaxone treatment can successfully ameliorate these cognitive processes. Previous research have shown that chronic Ceftriaxone treatment can induce the expression of glutamate transporter GLT-1 primarily in astrocytes. This phenomenon can halt the glutamate excitotoxicity induced by ischemic stroke in the brain and most importantly in the hippocampus. Halting excitotoxicity after ischemia may be the mechanism behind the positive effect of Ceftriaxone on the learning and memory of the rat model of global ischemia. Our research shows that Ceftriaxone can affect learning and memory defects induced by global ischemia in rats.,True,TnCN5goAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://profdoc.um.ac.ir/paper-abstract-1067602.html,,,,,0,0,0

To study the effect of interaction with opioid system. intraperitoneal administration of hydroalcoholic extract (dose. 50mg/kg). naloxone (dose. 2mg/kg) and co-administration of the extract and naloxone were performed. To investigate the effect of interaction with vanilloid system. intrathecal administration of extract (0.01 mg/10μl). capsaicin (0.002 mg/10μl) and co-administration of extract and capsaicin were performed. Paw volume was measured before and one hour after sub-plantar administration of formalin using plethysmometer method in order to assess inflammatory edema.Results: Intraperitoneal administration of extract alone or in combination with naloxone reduced the inflammatory rat paw edema volume (p< 0.001). On the other hand. capsaicin increased rat paw edema volume (p< 0.01). but intrathecal administration of extract alone and in combination with capsaicin decreased the inflammatory rat paw edema volume (p< 0.01).Conclusion: The results of this study showed that decarboxylated cannabinoids in hydroalcoholic extract decrease the capsaicin-induced inflammatory rat paw edema through activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors and desensitization of TRPV1 receptor. On the contrary. administration of naloxone has not antagonized the reduction effect of extract on inflammatory paw edema. and it is likely that the effect of the extract has not exerted through opioid receptors.,True,TnCN5goAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,http://journal.muq.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=842&sid=1&slc_lang=fa&ftxt=1,,,,http://journal.muq.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=842&sid=1&slc_lang=fa&ftxt=1,0,0,0

Крім цього. вони є амортизатором при русі і зменшують коефіцієнт тертя. знижуючи ймовірність зносу кісткової і хрящової тканини. Всього в нашому тілі близько 360 суглобів. Медики розрізняють більше трьох сотень захворювань пов'язаних з суглобами. Основною причиною виникнення проблем з суглобами є загальне старіння організму. За статистикою. зі скаргами на біль в суглобах-артралгія-звертається приблизно 50% людей старше 40 років. а після 70 років симптом проявляється вже в 90% випадків.

Сьогодні застосування наночасток срібла (НЧAg) в раневих покриттях дозволено FAD (Адміністрацією продуктів харчування і ліків) в США. Препарати. які містять срібло. дозволені для зовнішнього використання для придушення інфекцій. Показано. що використання НЧAg при лікуванні опіків. дає кращі результати. ніж традиційні препарати срібла (на основі AgNO3)[1-3].НЧAg використовують як покриття на текстилі або полімерній матриці [4. 5]. НЧAg можна синтезувати за допомогою біополімерів. тому дану особливість використовують при створенні антимікробних. лікувальних текстильних матеріалів (ранових покриттів). що містять природні або штучні целюлозні волокна [6]. Целюлоза в певних умовах (температура. pH. тривалість дії. концентрація розчинної солі металу) є відновником катіонів металів. В результаті на текстилі з целюлозних волокон формуються НЧAg. які надають текстилю антимікробні та лікувальні властивості. У раневих покриттях НЧAg виконують роль біоциду. вбиваючи патогенні мікроби. однак це сприяє і більш ефективному і швидкому загоєнню ран. у зв’язку з чим доцільним було провести узагальнення деяких причин їх активного використання [7].,True,dy9gHRIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://dspace.nuph.edu.ua/bitstream/123456789/19231/1/43-45.pdf,,,,https://dspace.nuph.edu.ua/bitstream/123456789/19231/1/43-45.pdf,0,0,0

Thailand,2017,M Wahid and S Prasarnpun and N Yimtragool,16,Genetics and Molecular Research,3,,Genetics and Molecular Research,Cadmium (Cd) is produced mainly as a by-product of zinc mining. In Thailand. the largest zinc mine is located in the Mae Sot district. Tak Province. Samples of Monopterus albus were collected from paddy fields in 4 sites. three downstream and one upstream from the zinc mine. The upstream site was considered to be uncontaminated while the three downstream sites were considered to be contaminated with Cd. Studies on the accumulation level of cadmium were conducted on the liver of the fish using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer technique. The metallothionein (MT) gene expression level in the liver. as a potential biomarker for long-term Cd exposure in their natural habitat. was also assessed. The level of hepatic MT gene expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. The result showed that Cd accumulation in the liver was much higher in swamp eels collected from the downstream sites when compared to those collected from the upstream site. The hepatic MT level in the upstream site was 0.75-fold. while the other three downstream sites were 0.36-. 4.44- and 0.94-fold. There is no parallel correlation between hepatic cadmium levels and hepatic MT gene expression.

In this study we focus on leiomyoma and normal myometrium phosphoproteome. to identify differentially phosphorylated proteins involved in tumorigenic signaling pathways. and in anti-apoptotic processes and cell survival. We obtained paired tissue samples of seven leiomyomas and adjacent myometria and analyzed the phosphoproteome by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) combined with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain. We used mass spectrometry for protein identification and Western blotting for 2-DE data validation. Quantities of 33 proteins enriched by the IMAC approach were significantly different in the leiomyoma if compared to the myometrium. Bioinformatic analysis revealed ten tumorigenic signaling pathways and four phosphoproteins involved in both the inhibition of apoptosis and cell survival. Our study highlights the involvement of the phosphoproteome in leiomyoma growth. Further studies are needed to understand the role of phosphorylation in leiomyoma.

FAC SCIENCE,The aim of this study was to fabricate and characterize scaffolds of fish skin gelatin from unicorn leatherjackets (Aluterus monoceros) reinforced with chitosan for application in bone tissue engineering. The fish gelatin was extracted at 17% yield on the basis of the fish skin. and characterized according to AOAC official methods of analysis. As the fish gelatin exhibited low gel strength. fabrication of chitosan/fish gelatin (CG) scaffolds crosslinked with glutaraldehyde was performed by freeze-drying technique. The superior porous structure. mechanical. and swelling properties of the CG scaffolds in comparison to those of the single component scaffolds were observed. The scaffolds were nontoxic to MC3T3-E1 cells on MTT assay. supported biomineralization. and promoted cell attachment. It can be therefore concluded that the extracted fish gelatin is a feasible biomaterial for scaffold fabrication by reinforcement with chitosan.,True,altlKc0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,http://www.thaiscience.info/Journals/Article/CMJS/10987605.pdf,852945904232674441,/scholar?cites=852945904232674441,,http://www.thaiscience.info/Journals/Article/CMJS/10987605.pdf,0,0,0

Roads impact much of the environment as they fragment habitat and introduce traffic noise into the acoustic environment. deferentially affecting wildlife in roadside habitat. I explored how traffic noise affects the detection of birds based on whether their vocalizations were masked by traffic noise. Masked species detection was not affected by an increase in traffic noise amplitude. while there was a negative effect of traffic noise amplitude on unmasked species detection. an unexpected result. Conducting more experiments on individual species detection will help ecologists better understand the changes in behavior that influence detection. The effect of human activity on the environment should be better understood by more than just ecologists. Yet. people in the United States fall behind other developed countries in their understanding of many scientific processes. such as evolution. Improved evolutionary knowledge leads people to have a higher acceptance of evolution. and biology educators are responsible for improving evolution education to promote more acceptance. For example. biology students seem committed to survival-based reasoning of evolution. but there are other important evolutionary forces to consider. such as sexual selection. Multiple selection pressures can act on a species. including pressures that select for traits that are maladaptive for survival.

Larval zebrafish are an attractive model to investigate genetic contributions to neurological diseases. However. current CRISPR-Cas9 methods are difficult to apply to large genetic screens studying behavioural phenotypes. To facilitate rapid genetic screening. we developed a simple sequencing-free tool to validate gRNAs and a highly effective CRISPR-Cas9 method capable of converting >90% of injected embryos directly into F0 biallelic knockouts. We demonstrate that F0 knockouts reliably recapitulate complex mutant phenotypes. such as altered molecular rhythms of the circadian clock. escape responses to irritants. and multi-parameter day-night locomotor behaviours. The technique is sufficiently robust to knockout multiple genes in the same animal. for example to create the transparent triple knockout crystal fish for imaging.

1090213,Ketogenic diet or BHB improves epileptiform spikes. memory. survival in Alzheimer’s model,2017,John C Newman and François Kroll and Scott Ulrich and Jorge J Palop and Eric Verdin,,bioRxiv,,136226,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Links between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are seen in both human patients and mouse models. Human patients with AD may commonly have subclinical epileptiform spikes (EP spikes)1. and overt epilepsy is associated with more rapid cognitive decline2. Mechanistic studies in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have shown that altered network activity and epileptiform spikes stem from dysfunctional inhibitory interneurons3. which are key elements of cortical circuits underlying cognition4. Treatments that reduce epileptiform spikes improve cognition in these models5.6. Thus. targeting subclinical epileptiform activity may be a promising new therapeutic approach to AD7. Ketogenic diet (KD) has long been used to treat forms of epilepsy8. including Dravet syndrome. a childhood epilepsy caused by mutations in a gene that is critical for inhibitory interneuron function in mouse AD models5.9. However. the concurrent effects of a ketogenic diet on brain electrical activity. cognitive decline. and survival have not been tested. and the translational rationale and feasibility of such an intervention remain uncertain. Here we show that a ketogenic diet reduces epileptiform spikes in the hAPPJ20 mouse model of AD. Similar reduction of EP spikes is observed using a β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) ester in both AD and Dravet mice. A ketogenic diet improves context-dependent and visuo-spatial learning in hAPPJ20 mice. It also reduces the high seizure-related mortality observed in male mice of this model.

Ketogenic diet and fasting have been used for centuries to treat certain forms of epilepsy. including those mechanistically related to disrupted network activity in Alzheimer’s models like Dravet syndrome. We found that ketogenic diet. but not fasting. consistently reduced epileptiform spikes in the APPJ20 Alzheimer’s mouse model.

Such chemicals as hydrogen sulfide. carbon dioxide. and ammonia are entrained in the steam and aggressively promote damage. The abrasive action of gas-accelerated solid particles also causes erosion and mechanical damage. These combined forces promote severe mechanical damage and initiate pits. which aggravate stress corrosion cracking and corrosion fatigue. One way to increase component life and the service of the unit - without resorting to costly replacements - is by using protective coatings. This paper describes part of a research program using erosion testing. and corrosion testing using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). to identify. measure. and evaluate commercially available coatings.

Locust Grove has a 28 acre forest on the property that has been determined to be less than 45 years old. A wildlife survey using camera traps was undertaken to examine the biodiversity of the re-grown forest. The study identified eight mammal. thirteen bird and two amphibian species. The two most abundant mammals caught on video were the White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and the Northern Raccoon (Procyon lotor).

It documents how the Group evolved and developed its objectives. and highlights its main achievements. one of which was the passage of legislation that provided full protection to 11 spawning sites and introduced a closed season for the Nassau grouper. The Group was formed in response to the drastic decline in numbers of spawning Nassau groupers. which was dramatically brought to the attention of many concerned organizations at a historic workshop held in July 2001 in Belize City. The Group assumed the responsibility of taking action to stem the decline. Its success has depended to a large extent on its diverse membership. which is drawn from government agencies. NGOs and the private sector. The invaluable contribution made by many fishers. who unselfishly shared their traditional knowledge of spawning banks with researchers and managers. was also a major factor in the Group’s success and the protection of many spawning sites. Members are interested in sharing their experience with other similar groups that are being developed within the Mesoamerican reef region.,True,c1MWVvcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,http://aquaticcommons.org/13257/2/gcfi_59-63.pdf,17714166891180963747,/scholar?cites=17714166891180963747,,http://aquaticcommons.org/13257/2/gcfi_59-63.pdf,0,0,0

One goal of the pilot program is to educate local decision-makers in communities surrounding the Albemarle and Pamlico estuaries about the opportunities and challenges inherent in preparing their communities for the potential impacts of climate change. In the study reported here. graduate students at the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University administered a 17 question web-based pilot survey to address the Nicholas Institute’s need for baseline information about local public officials’ knowledge. beliefs. perceptions. and motivations regarding a) the impacts of climate change on their community. and b) activities they are currently undertaking or may undertake to increase resilience and mitigate the effects of climate change in their community. The results of this study provide a starting point for the Nicholas Institute to develop an education program for local officials that is appropriately matched to their needs. The survey was e-mailed to 160 local decision-makers in coastal cities and counties in North Carolina. Participants were chosen for the survey from coastal counties and cities in North Carolina using a non-random. non-probability sampling method. though attempts were made to gain representation from all coastal counties in North Carolina.

1090327,Ecohydrological analysis of a groundwater influenced blanket bog: occurrence of Schoenus nigricans in Roundstone Bog. Connemara. Ireland,2016,Ab P Grootjans and G Hensgens and R Hogenboom and B Aarts and J Manschot and JGM Roelofs,,,,,,Since the late 1960s. the occurrence of Schoenus nigricans in Irish blanket bogs has been attributed to inputs of salt spray to the blanket bogs. due to their proximity to the coast and the predominant westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean. To test this hypothesis we carried out an ecohydrological field study at a large blanket bog in the western part of Connemara. Ireland. We described peat profiles in two transects and sampled pore water from peat at different depths. The water samples were analysed and their macro-ionic composition was used to locate possible inputs of calcareous groundwater to the system. We found clear evidence for inflow of calcareous groundwater at various sites and depths. Inflow of rather base-rich groundwater was indicated by high values of electrical conductivity (EC). high contents of calcium and bicarbonate. and high pH of the pore water. The peat profiles contained macro-remains of reed (Phragmites australis). in most cases only in deeper layers of peat. but at one location throughout the profile. This is another indication that the blanket bog was a groundwater-fed fen for quite some time. We conclude that the occurrence of S. nigricans in the blanket bog studied could be well explained by the hypothesis that S. nigricans is a relic from former more base-rich conditions. Relatively high base saturation could have persisted due to the prevailing groundwater flow in the upper layers preventing decalcification or other loss of cations from the whole soil profile including the topsoil.,True,nZenQisAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/163289/163289.pdf,18305191770002117258,/scholar?cites=18305191770002117258,,https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/163289/163289.pdf,0,0,0

Natural fluctuations of sex hormones during the estrous cycle affect the hippocampal neurogenesis of adult female. This study aimed to investigate the neurogenic changes in the hippocampus at different phases of estrous cycle.Materials and Methods: Different stages of the estrous cycle of the NMRI mice (6-8) mice were determined by staining of vaginal smears. Also. the qualitative assessment of cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus was performed by Nissl staining and Ki-67 immunostaining marker (Ki-67). The apoptosis was determined using the TUNEL assay. Diameter of the hippocampal vessels was measured at different stages of the estrous cycle.Results: In microscopic sections stained with Cresyl Violet observed cell density in proestrous stage of estrous cycle was greater than any other stages of the estrous cycle. Comparison of sections stained with immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 staining showed that cell proliferation at proestrous are more than any other stages. The statistical analysis showed that vessel diameter was significantly greater at the proestrous stage than diestrous and metestrous. Also. TUNEL assay showed that cell death in the proestrous stage had the least reactivity.Conclusion: Proestrous stage of the estrous cycle was associated with increased cell proliferation and vessel diameter as well as reduced cell death in the dentate gyrus of the mice hippocampus.,True,3RBBXhYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,4,http://feyz.kaums.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=2345&sid=1&slc_lang=en,1056900037733131912,/scholar?cites=1056900037733131912,,http://feyz.kaums.ac.ir/files/site1/user_files_9ca9a9/sayyadi-A-10-176-1144-727c444.pdf,0,0,0

The hippocampus also comprises many steroid receptors suggesting the modulatory effects of gonadal hormones on the hippocampal plasticity. Sex differences at the level of structure and function of the hippocampus are mostly due to the fluctuations of steroid hormones during the estrous cycle. The purpose of this study was to investigate the morphological changes in hippocampal astrocytes and also the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at different phases of the estrous cycle.Materials and Methods: In this study. different stages of the estrous cycle were determined in 6-8 week NMRI female mice by methylene blue-stained vaginal smears. The morphological changes of astrocytes in the hippocampus were investigated using GFAP immunohistochemistry. In addition to the morphological study. the expression of astrocytic marker was quantitatively evaluated.Results: GFAP immunostaining showed the changes in the morphology of astrocytes and also in the serum level of estrogen during the estrous cycle.

Here. we dedicated the current work to investigate the role of thyroid hormone analogue (L-thyroxine. L-TH) in regulating the renal cytotoxicity using in vivo and in vitro models. Swiss mice were exposed to gamma radiation (IRR. 6Gy) or treated with cisplatin (CIS. 15 mg/kg. i. p.) for induction of nephrotoxicity. Remarkably. pretreatment with L-TH (1μg/kg) ameliorated the elevated kidney function biomarkers. oxidative stress and protected the renal tissue from the subsequent cellular damage. Likewise. L-TH inhibited the apoptotic cascade by down-regulating the extreme consumption of the cellular energy (ATP). the expression of caspase-3 and Bax. and the stimulation of cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR)/calcium mobilization. Moreover. incubation with L-TH (120nM/4h) significantly blocked the cytotoxicity of CIS on Vero cells and the depletion of NAD+ content as well as modified the ADP-ribose cyclase (CD38) enzymatic activity. High doses of L-TH (up to30 nM/4h) inversely increased the radiosensitivity of Vero cells towards IRR (up to 6Gy). On the other hand. L-TH did not interfere CIS-induced cytotoxicity of colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell line. In conclusion. pretreatment with L-TH could be a promising protective approach to the renal cellular damage induced during either CIS or IRR therapy by regulating the unbalanced oxidative status. the expression of pro-apoptotic biomarkers via modulation of cADPR mediated-calcium mobilization.Citation: El-Hamoly T.

Influenza viruses. belong to Orthomyxoviridae family. are three types (A. B and C). The host restriction of influenza A is partially determined by distribution of specific receptors on the surface of the susceptible cells. These receptors. known as sialic acids. are composed of nine carbon monosaccharaides on the terminal position of glycan chain (Varki. 2007). Binding of the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses to sialic acid residues is the initial step of viral infection. Viruses isolated from different host species differ in their binding according to the type of sialic acids. eg N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). or the types of linkage connecting the sialic acid molecule to the neighboring sugar. Influenza viruses isolated from mammalian hosts prefer alpha 2. 6-linked sialic acids whereas most avian influenza viruses preferentially recognize Neu5Ac attached via an alpha 2. 3-linkage to galactose (Rogers and Paulson. 1983; Rogers et al.. 1983).,True,75BC1ZAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sahar_Rahman/publication/279956291_Comparative_Analysis_of_Avian_and_Swine_Influenza_Viruses_Infections_of_Well_Differentiated_Lung_Epithelial_Cells_of_Turkey/links/5625166a08aeabddac91b866/Comparative-Analysis-of-Avian-and-Swine-Influenza-Viruses-Infections-of-Well-Differentiated-Lung-Epithelial-Cells-of-Turkey.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sahar_Rahman/publication/279956291_Comparative_Analysis_of_Avian_and_Swine_Influenza_Viruses_Infections_of_Well_Differentiated_Lung_Epithelial_Cells_of_Turkey/links/5625166a08aeabddac91b866/Comparative-Analysis-of-Avian-and-Swine-Influenza-Viruses-Infections-of-Well-Differentiated-Lung-Epithelial-Cells-of-Turkey.pdf,0,0,0

1090431,Journal of Chemical. Biological and Physical Sciences,,Majda Srabovic and Melita Huremovic and Benjamin Catovic and Samra Kulic and Aida Taletovic,,,,,,Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a synthetic non-opioid derivative of paminophenol and basic bioactive molecule in numerous pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of colds and flu. In combination with opioid analgesics. acetaminophen can also be used in the management of more severe pain such as post-surgical pain and providing palliative care in advanced cancer patients. Design of synthesis of acetaminophen is based on a modern approach of choosing the right synthetic route and using methods necessary for the characterization of the resulting pharmaceutically active compound. thereby providing reliable parameters of the chemical quality of the synthesized molecules. Formation of the preferred form of acetaminophen is a process made up of two stages. where in the first stage an acid catalyzed reaction gives the crude acetaminophen. The reaction takes place according to the mechanism of nucleophilic addition in which the nitrogen atom of the p-aminophenol as nucleophile by attacking a carbonyl group of acetic anhydride forms an intermediate which undergoes the further elimination of the acetate anion. Recrystallization is one of the most common techniques used for purifying drug solids. One of the goals of this study was to achieve the results through the crystallization process in optimum conditions. in order to improve the yield and adequate purity of synthesized acetaminophen.

Crop straw return is an important conservation agricultural practice to restore SOC in the soil. Soil microbial communities are actively involved in decomposition of crop straws. Decomposition of straws releases bonded nutrients. water. organic carbon and energy in the soil. which enhance plant growth as well as increase microbial biomass. This study was conducted to analyze the effect of the conventional practice of wheat straw burning on bacterial populations present in the soil shortly after crop harvesting. Results indicate that wheat cultivated soil is inhabited by many plant growths promoting bacterial genera like Acinetobacter. Azotobacter. Bacillus.

Strelkovimermis spiculatus (Mermithidae: Nematoda) emerges from hosts and aggregates to form mating clusters characterized by intense male-male competition for females. Successful males deposit an adhesive copulatory plug over the female vulva after insemination. In choice experiments. males strongly preferred virgin females. whereas plugged females were ignored. Males made no attempt to displace copulatory plugs deposited by previous males. Plugged females repelled males without the need for physical contact. The observed chemical repellency was independent of females. since excised plugs alone showed the same negative male response. Removal of the plug shortly after mating reduced fecundity by 90%. presumably due to spermatids leaking from the vulva.
