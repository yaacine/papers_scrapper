We find closed form solutions for a number of popularly traded energy derivatives such as: forwards. European call options written on spot prices and European Call options written on forward contracts. Our modeling approach is to first construct noisy supply and demand processes and then equate them to find an equilibrium price. This approach is very general while still allowing for sensitivity analysis within a valuation setting. Our assumption is that. in the presence of emission costs. traditional supply growth will slow down causing output prices of energy products to become more costly over time. However. emission costs do not immediately cause output price appreciation. but instead expose individual projects. particularly those with high emission outputs. to much more extreme risks through the cost side of their …,True,qkX1PwoAAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C,10,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988309002035,5091210721113363408,/scholar?cites=5091210721113363408,,https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/48998/Elliott_Model_Energy_2009_postprint_file.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

Density functions are nonnegative and have a constrained integral. and thus do not constitute a vector space. The implementation of established functional time series forecasting methods for such nonlinear data is therefore problematic. Two new methods are developed and compared to two existing methods.

Asymptotic theory is developed assuming the factors form a weakly dependent vector-valued time series. and the regression errors are weakly dependent functions. To accommodate the empirical behavior of the cross-section of returns and of the factors. we allow both the factors and the error functions can exhibit mild departures from stationarity. This requires new asymptotic theory which leads to several tests for the significance of function-valued regression coefficients. The new approach to the study of the significance of risk factors for a cross-section of returns complements the established Fama–French approach based on portfolio construction.

We find that our “best” model. which contains forward-looking proxies of returns and volatility outperform other models. carries a default prediction accuracy rate of 89%.

Additionally. the price discovery contribution of Weeklys. albeit modest when compared to the underlying index itself. is substantially larger than that of Monthlys.

A market orientated approach,2003,Edmond Baranes and Jean-Philippe Tropeano,33,Regional Science and Urban Economics,4,445-466,North-Holland,According to empirical evidence. technological spillovers are spatially bounded. This is one of the main reasons why firms are induced to locate in close proximity despite tough competition. In this paper. we attempt to endogenize such spillovers. For that purpose. we argue that spatial proximity gives more incentives to competing firms to share knowledge. We show that spatial proximity and thus tough competition is the best way for firms to prevent free-riding in case of knowledge sharing. Indeed. fiercer competition impedes free-riding as such a behavior has a dramatic negative impact on profits. Moreover. our results have important implications for regional policy. We point out that a slight decrease in transport costs triggers spatial polarization which implies knowledge sharing and thereby enhances innovation.

Using U.S. state-level data from 1998 to 2015. we find that the relationship between the price of natural gas and investments in solar and wind capacity is non-linear and can be represented by an inverted U-shape. Hence. for relatively low natural gas prices. the two modes of production are substitutes. After a price threshold is reached. the two are complementary. A theoretical explanation argues that this stylized fact is the result of a trade-off between two characteristics of these modes of production: the high degree of flexibility of electricity production using natural gas as an input and the low marginal cost of renewable energy sources.,True,GWOxRKkAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,31,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517305785,5659249348375662859,/scholar?cites=5659249348375662859,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/188339/1/Baranes_Jacqmin_Poudou_FAERE_WP2015.02%202.pdf,0,0,0

We consider two market segments: one in which the network operator only offers the old technology (copper). and the other in which both technologies are offered.

We assume that there are two market segments: one in which operators compete on equal terms. with a new technology. and the other in which the entrant is at a disadvantage since the technology it offers is inferior to the incumbent’s. Results show that asymmetric regulation can create favorable conditions that allow the entrant to strengthen its market positioning. and enhance consumer net utilities and social welfare.

Two regulatory instruments associated with the asymmetry between operators are implemented. namely glide path regulation and asymmetric regulation. The first regulatory device is to gradually decrease asymmetric treatment between mobile and fixed network operators while the second one is associated with asymmetric flexibility in setting MTRs between European mobile operators. With different model specifications. our study demonstrates that when the MTRs are regulated to lower levels. later entrants are likely to cut retail prices to gain more subscribers. and resulting in lower average national service prices.

Using a two-tier oligopolistic structure. we first show that gas storage is actually used strategically even in a symmetric oligopolistic setting along the gas value chain. Storage is then a way to intensify competition on the spot market. Second. we analyze the setting where a company has favored access to storage. for example due to a historical monopolistic position. and we analyze this as a leadership situation in the context of TPA regulation. We then show that this setting compels the leader to adopt a strategic storage decision. This strategy consists of levels of gas stored being greater than supplies available in the downstream market. Such a leader decision is part of a strategy to raise a rival's costs.

The report highlighted the preponderant place occupied by historical natural gas suppliers in the market place and the barriers they have constructed in their former exclusively held territories. with the obvious intention of limiting the entry of new suppliers into the market. The authors conclude that to avoid such competition-limiting behaviour. it will be necessary to limit the power of the existing supply firms. To lay the foundation for a series of recommendations the authors first examine the positions occupied by the various actors in the gas supply chain. followed by a review of the principal factors affecting the European natural gas market. paying special attention to existing regulations. Based on the literature on vertical integration of markets. the final section makes certain proposals concerning the separation of the gas production and distribution functions and the resulting behaviour of the various actors in terms of their respective positions along the natural gas supply chain.

In an infinitely repeated game framework. we show that the bundling strategy of the entrant might hinder collusion.

In these networks. there are call externalities enabling consumers to assess the quality of the calls they send and receive. Networks compete in two-part tariffs. Our aim is to show that the “profit neutrality” result no longer applies due to network asymmetry and call externalities.

A prosumer has a grid-connected decentralized production unit and makes two types of exchanges with the grid: energy imports when the local production is insufficient to match the local consumption and energy exports when local production exceeds it. There exists two systems to measure the exchanges: a net metering system that uses a single meter to measure the balance between exports and imports and a net purchasing system that uses two meters to measure separately power exports and imports. Both systems are currently used for residential consumption. We build a model to compare the two metering systems. Under net metering. the price of exports paid to prosumers is implicitly set at the price of the electricity that they import. We show that net metering leads to (1) too many prosumers.

Using U.S. state-level data from 1998 to 2015. we find that the relationship between the price of natural gas and investments in solar and wind capacity is non-linear and can be represented by an inverted U-shape. Hence. for relatively low natural gas prices. the two modes of production are substitutes. After a price threshold is reached. the two are complementary. A theoretical explanation argues that this stylized fact is the result of a trade-off between two characteristics of these modes of production: the high degree of flexibility of electricity production using natural gas as an input and the low marginal cost of renewable energy sources.,True,a6T6j7QAAAAJ:TIZ-Mc8IlK0C,31,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517305785,5659249348375662859,/scholar?cites=5659249348375662859,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/188339/1/Baranes_Jacqmin_Poudou_FAERE_WP2015.02%202.pdf,0,0,0

Under a net metering system where the meter runs backward when there is excessive PV production. the electricity produced by a solar panel is valued at the retail price.

More precisely. we argue that the relationship between the natural gas price and capacity investments in solar and wind power energy is far from univocal. We find that this relationship is not linear but is better represented by a bell-shaped curve. Hence. for relativelly low gas price. the two modes of production are substitutable. After a price threshhold is reached. the two are complementary. A theoretical model explains this as the trade-off resulting from two forces: the input price differential of these two modes of production and the risks related to the unpredictable nature of the intermittence of renewable energies. Using US state level data from 1998 to 2012. we find that this relationship is robust to various empirical specifications.,True,a6T6j7QAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.725.5706&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6889992948222166728,/scholar?cites=6889992948222166728,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.725.5706&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We show that net metering (where prosumers face the same price whether they buy or sell energy) leads to too much PV investment compared to the first-best outcome. We also find that consumers are attracted into prosumption independent of their self-consumption profile. ie the extent to which their energy consumption correlates with their production. When a net purchasing system is in place (where prosumers are charged a different price for the energy they buy from the grid than for the energy they export to the grid). consumers with relatively high levels of self-consumption are more likely to invest in PV installations. which is desirable from an efficiency standpoint as these prosumers exchange less with the grid. Even when the regulator lacks information about the self-consumption rate of prosumers. net purchasing can achieve the first-best outcome.Target: Researchers; Professionals,True,a6T6j7QAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC,0,https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/250950,,,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/250950/3/Prosumers_newRevisionUP.pdf,0,0,0

A prosumer has a grid-connected decentralized production unit and makes two types of exchanges with the grid: energy imports when the local production is insufficient to match the local consumption and energy exports when local production exceeds it. There exists two systems to measure the exchanges: a net metering system that uses a single meter to measure the balance between exports and imports and a net purchasing system that uses two meters to measure separately power exports and imports. Both systems are currently used for residential consumption. We build a model to compare the two metering systems. Under net metering. the price of exports paid to prosumers is implicitly set at the price of the electricity that they import. We show that net metering leads to (1) too many prosumers.

While this behavior is beneficial for the energy system as a whole. it is not encouraged by a net-metering system. Relying on a large-scale survey conducted among households with solar PV in Wallonia. we investigate the factors impacting their decision to self-consume. As many as forty percent of our respondents declare to do so. notwithstanding the lack of incentives.

1184094,Regulation of an open access essential facility,2008,Axel Gautier and Manipushpak Mitra,75,Economica,300,662-682,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,A vertically integrated firm owns an essential input and operates on the downstream market. There is a potential entrant in the downstream market. Both firms use the same essential input. The regulator's objectives are (i) to ensure financing of the essential input and (ii) to generate competition in the downstream market. The regulatory mechanism grants non‐discriminatory access of the essential facility to the entrant provided it pays a two‐part tariff to the incumbent. The optimal mechanism generates inefficient entry. The inefficient entry captures the trade‐off between market efficiency and infrastructure financing resulting from incomplete information and non‐discriminatory access.,True,tar55vUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,24,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2007.00638.x,2970333233566517396,/scholar?cites=2970333233566517396,,https://orbi.uliege.be/jspui/bitstream/2268/10788/1/2008_11_Economica.pdf,0,0,0

These stakeholders can be categorized into three groups:(political) decision makers. supervisors. and interest groups.

1184099,Competitively neutral universal service obligations,2012,Axel Gautier and Xavier Wauthy,24,Information Economics and Policy,3-4,254-261,North-Holland,Universal service obligations impose specific costs on the universal service provider and the latter may call for an appropriate compensation. Most often. a two-step procedure is put forward to finance the universal service in a competitive environment. Firstly. the cost of the universal service is assessed; secondly. the provider must be compensated for this cost. We argue that this procedure is problematic because the implementation of a compensation scheme affects the behavior of market participants and leads to an overcompensation of the universal service provider. We put forward an alternative approach to this problem that fully acknowledges the distortions that result from the compensation mechanism.,True,tar55vUAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,19,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624512000273,607892366967725901,/scholar?cites=607892366967725901,,https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/115428/3/2012_Gautier_wauthy_IEP.pdf,0,0,0

A typical example is the exclusion of VoIP applications by telecom companies offering internet and voice services. A monopoly ISP may want to exclude a competing internet app if it is of inferior quality and the ISP cannot ask for a surcharge for its use. Competition between ISPs never leads to full app exclusion but it may lead to a fragmented internet where only one ISP offers the application.

Redistribution Vs incentives,2001,Axel Gautier and Florian Heider,,,76.2001,,Nota di Lavoro,In this paper we explain the apparent ''diversification discount'' of conglomerates without assuming inefficient-cross subsidisation through internal capital markets. Instead we assume that an internal capital market efficiently redistributes scare resources across a conglomerate's divisions between successive production periods. The need for redistribution arises from the fact that resources may sometimes be produced by divisions which happen to be successful in an earlier production stage but which do not have the best investment opportunities in future production stages.In contrast to the existing literature we consider explicitly the incentive problem between corporate headquarter and divisional managers using a standard Moral-Hazard framework. We show that although a complete incentive contract can be written bilaterally between headquarter and divisional managers. the redistribution of resources across divisions creates additional agency costs in a conglomerate.Moreover. assuming that no complete contract can govern the interim redistribution policy by the headquarter. we show how the agency problem with divisional managers constrains headquarters interim redistribution to be ex ante inefficient.,True,tar55vUAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,11,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/155239,13584369781473404654,/scholar?cites=13584369781473404654,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/155239/1/NDL2001-076.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. we show that adding a unit subsidy in the compensation scheme of a USO helps to counteract the inefficiencies that result from these strategic links. Welfare obtained under different implementations of the USO depends on whether use of the unit subsidy is limited or not. In this respect. franchise bidding for the USO. where firms submit bids for lump-sum subsidies. is welfare-dominated by the exogenous choice of the USP and by pay-or-play regulation. Similarly. the second-best allocation can be attained through the endogenous choice of the USP’s geographic area of monopoly. provided the unit subsidy instrument is available.,True,RdGae1kAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,20,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167624508000516,6098055949863359268,/scholar?cites=6098055949863359268,,,0,0,0

Although they are generally offered simultaneously with regular service. economic models of their allocative efficiency are based on the implicit assumption that they are the only service available. We present a model in which participation to a particular load management program. called self-rationing. is optional. We show that. under a break-even constraint. welfare-maximizing prices involve a subsidy from the self-rationing program to regular service whenever peak demand is less elastic than base demand.

1184145,Electricity rationing through a two-stage mechanism,1996,Joseph A Doucet and Kyung Jo Min and Michel Roland and Todd Strauss,18,Energy economics,3,247-263,,Analysis of interruptible service mechanisms has focused on the efficiency losses due to the absence of complete contingent contracts. There exists a second type of inefficiency which. to a large extent. has been ignored. It originates from the fact that the relative order. or ranking. of consumers' willingness to pay for a given quantity generally varies throughout the contract period. A more general model of electricity demand allowing for changes in the order of consumer willingness to pay for a given quantity is presented. Under such demand conditions. the use of a two-stage rationing mechanism is proposed. Rationing plans which maximize expected aggregate surplus are established in the first stage. The second stage consists in a market for allocation rights to be operated once the states of nature are revealed.

1184146,Universal service obligations and competition with asymmetric information,2009,Jean-Christophe Poudou and Michel Roland and Lionel Thomas,9,The BE Journal of Theoretical Economics,1,,De Gruyter,A regulator imposes a universal service obligation (USO) on a vertically integrated firm that owns an essential network. The regulator has imperfect information about the network’s fixed cost. Network access is provided to licensed competitors. The USO consists in a constraint on market coverage and is compensated through a mix of public funds and transfers from entrants. We first use a basic adverse selection model to show that. because of informational rents. a sufficiently high shadow cost of public funds can lead to a lower coverage with the USO than without it.

However. no previous analysis supports a formal link between equity and USO. In this paper. we describe the extent to which the imposition of USOs in oligopolistic network industries can meet the objectives of an inequality-averse regulator. We show that USOs can be used for equity purposes provided that the regulator is able to control the competitive structure of the industry.

The comparison is made under a duopoly structure with a potential entrant and an incumbent. which owns the essential facility and is responsible for universal service. The incumbent is also constrained to offer the same price on all markets.

Because electricity demand is subject to cyclical and random fluctuations. an equilibrium price would change constantly and spot pricing would generate substantial information and transactions costs. In the absence of spot prices. the utility must install enough capacity to meet peak demand with a given probability. and design a rationing plan for when the reserve margin proves inadequate. To avoid building new generation facilities. electric utilities have devised innovative rationing plans.

In this book. Jean-Jacques Laffont and David Martimort present the most thorough yet accessible introduction to incentives theory to date. Central to this theory is a simple question as pivotal to modern-day management as it is to economics research: What makes people act in a particular way in an economic or business situation? In seeking an answer. the authors provide the methodological tools to design institutions that can ensure good incentives for economic agents. This book focuses on the principal-agent model. the"" simple"" situation where a principal. or company. delegates a task to a single agent through a contract--the essence of management and contract theory. How does the owner or manager of a firm align the objectives of its various members to maximize profits? Following a brief historical overview showing how the problem of incentives has come to the fore in the past two centuries. the authors devote the bulk of their work to exploring principal-agent models and various extensions thereof in light of three types of information problems: adverse selection. moral hazard. and non-verifiability.

We consider an organization with an agent privately informed on his productivity and a risk averse supervisor getting signals on the agent's type. In a centralized organization. the principal can communicate and contract with both the supervisor and the agent. However. these two agents can collude against the principal. In a decentralized organization. the principal only communicates and contracts with the supervisor who in turn sub-contracts with the agent. We show that the two organizations achieve the same outcome.

Regulatory institutions offer a framework for this dynamic process. They put constraints on the interest group's influence. The dynamics of regulation and its long-run outcome depend on the political principal's. the regulator's and the regulated firm's time preferences and their information.

Such a move requires that the government be viewed not as a single. monolithic entity. but as a number of different government bodies with their own constituencies and regulatory tools. The “multi-tiered” government is limited in its ability to commit and is subject to interest groups affecting the regulatory process and imposing significant transaction costs on government interventions and ultimately. on their outcome. In this paper. we discuss the nature of these transaction costs and argue that the overall design of the government is the result of their minimization.

Direct externalities arise when the contracting variable of one principal affects directly the other principal's payoff. Out-of-equilibrium messages are used by principals to precommit themselves to distort their strategic behavior. We characterize pure-strategy symmetric equilibria arising in such games under complete information and show their multiplicity. We then introduce asymmetric information to refine the set of feasible conjectures. We show that a unique equilibrium may be selected by conveniently perturbing the information structure.

1184182,Renegotiation design with multiple regulators,1999,David Martimort,88,Journal of Economic Theory,2,261-293,Academic Press,One striking feature of the internal organization of governments is the existence of multiple regulators. This paper explains this organizational choice as coming from the government's limited ability to commit. The separation of powers between two regulators is modeled as a Stackelberg common agency game. With respect to the case of a single regulator. the allocative efficiency and the regulated firm's informational rent are both reduced in the unique equilibrium of this game. However. when regulators have a limited ability to commit. this static cost of regulators separation becomes a dynamic benefit. Separation makes renegotiation harder and improves commitment.

1184184,Infrastructure privatization and changes in corruption patterns: The roots of public discontent,2009,David Martimort and Stéphane Straub,90,Journal of Development Economics,1,69-84,North-Holland,This paper offers a theory of how the degree of corruption that prevails in a society responds to changes in the ownership structure of major public service providers. We show that there are cases in which privatization. even though it fosters investments in infrastructure. also opens the door to more corruption. The public dissatisfaction towards privatization is then crucially affected by the changes in the degree and pattern of corruption. Our model thus helps understand the seemingly paradoxical situation prevailing in Latin America. where most studies find that privatizations have been efficiency-enhancing and have fostered investments and. at the same time. popular dissatisfaction with the process is extremely high. especially among the middle class.

When participation is restricted to all or nothing (“intrinsic” agency). the agent must choose between both principals' contracts and selecting her outside option. When the agent is afforded the additional possibilities of choosing only one contract (“delegated” agency). competition is more intense. The two games have distinct predictions for participation. Intrinsic agency always induces more distortion in participation relative to the monopoly outcome. and equilibrium allocations are discontinuous for the marginal consumer.

Under such competition. the optimal strategy for an owner of consumer data that sells information in a single block is selling to only one firm. thereby maximizing the stakes for rival buyers.

1184195,Economic integration and political accountability,2004,Wilfried Sand-Zantman,48,European Economic Review,5,1001-1025,North-Holland,This paper studies to what extent economic integration. or globalization. influences the accountability of politicians. Assuming that politicians are controlled by the voters through reelection rules. we analyze to what extent economic integration affects the form of those rules and the efforts made by politicians. We define economic integration by the existence of policies and shocks interdependences between countries. Then. from a political point of view. this integration is shown to be a two-sided phenomenon. Shock-interdependence allows yardstick comparison. increases political accountability and therefore efforts while policy-interdependence induces a lack of responsibility and harms the extent to which politicians can be controlled.,True,aDNxrA4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,21,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292103001533,10965511936790943960,/scholar?cites=10965511936790943960,,http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/1396/1/sand_zantman.pdf,0,0,0

Asymmetric information and voluntary participation by sovereign and heterogeneous countries are key constraints on the design of those agreements. Mechanisms must prevent two sorts of free‐riding problems – free riding in effort provision and free riding in participation. As markets might fail to solve simultaneously those two problems. we construct instead a simple menu of options that trades off the provision of incentives for participating countries and the provision of incentives to participate.

Focusing on a particular class of perfect Bayesian equilibria. we show that there exist two kinds of equilibria.

In the second one. only one of the non-median types chooses to become candidates for the election and those equilibria hold for a number of (potential) candidates at most equal to three.

1184204,Network Effects,2016,Bruno Jullien and Wilfried Sand-Zantman,,Institut D’Economie Industrielle,,,,For now more than 15 years. the world economy has been transformed by the emergence and growth of firms operating on the Internet. These firms have adopted very diverse business models. Some. like Amazon. are mainly intermediaries between sellers and buyers. Others. as Facebook. connect people together. and use the presence of agents on their sites to advertise products. Firms can also provide a service. say a search engine. and make selective suggestions to the users related to this service. A common feature to all these companies is not only the fact that they operate on the Internet. but also that the quality of their services is enhanced when more people visit their website. There is thus a specific pattern where market shares. or more globally the number of users. are key elements in the value people derive from the good or the service. This pattern is called the network effect and this will be the topic of this report.To be more precise. we can define a (positive) network effect as a situation where the individual consumption benefit depends positively on the number of people that buy the same product or compatible products. The existence of services providing users with a value that depends not only on the characteristics of the good they buy but also on the number of people who buy the same good was of course known to economists or practitioners before the emergence of the Internet. The communication devices as the telephone or the fax are good examples of that. In these cases. agents directly benefit when others use the same good and the network effect concerns all the agents in the same manner.

Consequently. every firm can have an impact on the market conditions. In such situations. the State has responded to the “market power” of certain firms by taking some control over the functioning of these markets. in both more and less interventionist forms. such as controlling the level of market concentration. While most markets fall under competition laws. only certain highly-concentrated sectors are subject to a form of regulation specific to their activity; this is the case for many network industries in particular (water. electricity. telecommunications. gas. transport...). In these different examples. even if. as often the case. just a part of the sector is a natural monopoly (the distribution of water. the transport and distribution of electricity. the communications network. the physical transport network). it is the whole sector that is subject to regulation. be it either under the direct or indirect control of the public authorities for market conditions.This control can take various forms according to the period. the sector. and national traditions.

1184208,Taxation in the Digital Economy,2018,Wilfried Sand-Zantman,,,,,Working Paper for the Institut d’Economie Industrielle,In the 20th century. most developed countries taxed and redistributed–either with money or in kind–a growing share of their wealth. This was done by taxing economic activities. either on the production side or the consumption side. The wave of globalization that emerged after the Second World War. and more importantly since the beginning of the 1990s. made it more difficult for countries to tax firms. as tax evasion or tax optimization became easier. Even with these cross-border activities. as long as most of the items sold were from standard brickand-mortar companies. this was more a problem of implementation than of design. The development of the digital economy based on increasing returns to scale and intangible assets poses a more fundamental problem. Not only is it difficult to tax digital goods. but it is also hard to define what should be taxed. As a result. domestic digital business models are subject to an effective tax rate of only 9%. which is less than half that of traditional business models (see European Commission. 2018).,True,aDNxrA4AAAAJ:hMod-77fHWUC,1,https://idei.fr/sites/default/files/IDEI/documents/orange/rapport_29.pdf,3486060806145034108,/scholar?cites=3486060806145034108,,https://idei.fr/sites/default/files/IDEI/documents/orange/rapport_29.pdf,0,0,0

1184212,Welfare Standards in Competition Policy,2015,Jérôme Mathis and Wilfried Sand-Zantman,,,,29,,Competition policy focuses on the defense of market competition in order to increase welfare. One fundamental question is determining which welfare standard should be applied in antitrust enforcement. This question has been intensively debated for decades because different welfare standards. by producing different enforcements. create different incentives for firms to increase their productivity and investment and thus contribute to economic growth.To illustrate this debate. let us start by reviewing a Canadian merger case between Superior Propan Inc. and ICG Propane Inc. In I988. these two firms. the two largest distributors of propane in Canada. announced their decision to merge. Canada’s Commissioner of Competition first filed an application before the Competition Tribunal arguing that this merger would induce less competition in the vast majority of local markets. While the Tribunal accepted the Commissioner’s argument. it also accepted evidence for significant cost efficiencies. Therefore. the application of a total surplus criterion initially led the Tribunal to authorize the merger. The Court of Appeal rejected the use of the total surplus standard and based on a consumer surplus’s criterion. decided to block the merger. But the merger was finally accepted. and the application of a total surplus standard validated in this case.,True,aDNxrA4AAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02316755/document,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02316755/document,0,0,0

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae. a single cell yeast. was introduced at different concentrations (0.02. 0.1. 0.5. 1.0. 2.5 wt%) to execute an in-situ fermentation on coconut endosperm waste. The rearing of BSFL was started simultaneously and the rearing was stopped once the BSFL reached the fifth instar. With the increasing of yeast concentration. the rearing duration of BSFL was shortened from 15.5 to 13.5 days. Moreover. it was found that at 0.5 to 1.0 wt% yeast concentration. the lipid yield and lipid productivity of BSFL were statistically enhanced to their highest peaks. namely. at 49.4% and 0.53 g/day. respectively. With regard to biodiesel composition. BSFL-derived biodiesel contained mainly C12: 0. C14: 0. C16: 0 and C18: 1. The higher amount of saturated fatty acids could strengthen the oxidative stability biodiesel produced as compared with non-edible oils or microalgal lipid. At last. the addition of yeast was also found to improve the waste reduction index of coconut endosperm waste (CEW) from 0.31 to 0.40 g/day. heralding the capability of BSFL to valorize organic waste via bioconversion into its biomass to serve as a feedstock for biodiesel production.

A standard correction was applied to all the gravity data to produce Bouguer gravity anomaly of the study area. The Bouguer gravity anomaly was used to produce several maps of gravity anomalies by filtering processes and relate them to the geological structure and tectonic history of the study area. Data processing and interpretation were conducted using geophysical software. Oasis Montaj. This software was used in a number of gravity data filtering processes. such as Low Pass Filter (LPF) and the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD). Bouguer gravity anomaly map shows a circular structure in Bukit Bunuh area which is interpreted as a remnant of meteorite impact crater. The gravity anomaly appears to decrease from the edge of the crater and increases at the center. This feature indicates a complex crater structure which has central uplift. The Total Horizontal Derivative map of residual gravity anomaly shows structural trend such as lineaments and faults that dominant to the northwest‐southeast direction.

A standard correction was applied to all the gravity data to produce Bouguer gravity anomaly of the study area. The Bouguer gravity anomaly was used to produce several maps of gravity anomalies by filtering processes and relate them to the geological structure and tectonic history of the study area. Data processing and interpretation were conducted using geophysical software. Oasis Montaj. This software was used in a number of gravity data filtering processes. such as Low Pass Filter (LPF) and the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD). Bouguer gravity anomaly map shows a circular structure in Bukit Bunuh area which is interpreted as a remnant of meteorite impact crater. The gravity anomaly appears to decrease from the edge of the crater and increases at the center. This feature indicates a complex crater structure which has central uplift. The Total Horizontal Derivative map of residual gravity anomaly shows structural trend such as lineaments and faults that dominant to the northwest‐southeast direction. A model was produced using GM‐SYS 3D software to determine the geometry of the impact crater. The interpreted 3‐D model shows a diameter of the impact crater was approximately 2368 m and depth of about 400 m. The model of the crater appears to tilt toward southeast. which illustrates the ancient meteorite that hit this area about 1.83 million years ago possibility came from northwest direction.,True,7-e-ZzcAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,2,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288799244.pdf,15906506385802455077,/scholar?cites=15906506385802455077,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288799244.pdf,0,0,0

The study of rock mass classification system using rock mass rating (RMR) had been done to obtain the information about rock strength of a cut slope along the road particularly in Desa Tanjung Alai (KM 78-99). Six scanline with 10m each had been establihed to determine the RMR value of cut slope by observed some parameters. UCS value of the cut slope grouped into medium strong rock (20-50 MPa). RQD variation ranged from 9.4% to 78.7% caused by the difference of weathering grade. Similar discontinuity spacing and condition had been found in the cut slope with 200-600mm space. slightly rough surface. separation less than 1mm and slightly weathered wall. Absence of groundwater means the cut slope is in dry condition. Average RMR value is 58.5 therefore the cut slope classified as Class III (Fair Rock). which means the slope need some supporting method for potential failure prevention.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations revealed that the wires have diameters of approximately 270–290 nm and a length of 25 μm.

There has been a considerable upsurge of interest in the MI effect found in soft. amorphous. ferromagnetic materials and films due to wide range of application of these sensors in technology [1 3]. Magnetoimpedance properties of amorphous wires. ribbons. composite NiFe CoNiFe wires and magnetic films have been studied widely [1 5]. Ciureanu et al.[6] studied GMI effect in soft NiFe permalloy and ultrasoft NiCo-based amorphous fibers and in permalloy wires. Both longitudinal and transverse GMI effects had been observed in these fibers. Beach and Berkowitz [1] studied MI effect in NiFe plated wire.

The field dependence of Young’s modulus and magnetization combined with x‐ray analysis and scanning electron microscopy have been used to monitor the effects of annealing. The results indicate that progressive annealing leads first to relief of the radial casting stress with a corresponding reduction in angle between the average easy direction and the wire axis. Further annealing leads to surface crystallization for which it is suggested that the moments take up a circumferential orientation.

KLi3Fe(C2O4)3@C delivered a stable capacity of 140 mA h g−1 at 120 mA g−1. and showed a 91% capacity retention after 200 cycles. By combining cyclic voltammetry analysis and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy. the K storage mechanism is demonstrated to be a combined Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reaction and pseudocapacitive process.

Heterogeneous catalysts have been used to hydrogenate CO2 to methane. Heterogeneous catalysts are preferable to homogenous catalysts in terms of stability. separation. handling. and reuse. which reflects in lower costs for large-scale production. Significant progress has been made in this direction. the exploitation of novel heterogeneous catalysts. In this review. we discussed recent developments in this area. with emphases on catalytic reactivity and …,True,awbKaREAAAAJ:gsN89kCJA0AC,373,https://pubs.rsc.org/hy/content/articlehtml/2015/gc/c5gc00119f,7579287967648909264,/scholar?cites=7579287967648909264,,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/getauthorversionpdf/C5GC00119F,0,0,0

The results implied a d-electron transfer from Co to Ni. which increased the electron density of Ni in the Ni–Co/MSN. The formation of Ni–Co alloy in the Ni–Co/MSN helped in decreasing the Ni particle size. providing better metal dispersion. and established a stronger interaction between Ni and Co. as evidenced by TEM and H2-TPR analyses. In comparison to the Ni/MSN. the Ni–Co/MSN exhibited higher activity up to 97.5% CH4 conversion and stability for more than 30 h time on stream.

An infrared (IR) study with preadsorbed pyridine revealed that these protonic acid sites originated from the spillover of molecular hydrogen from the zinc species onto the zeolite surface. The requirements for this spillover effect were further studied by IR spectroscopy of adsorbed ammonia and carbon monoxide. The presence of zinc species in HZSM-5 suggested the exchange of acidic character towards strong Lewis acids rather than Brønsted acid sites.

In the model. the change of the nucleation rate for each variant due to the applied stress during transformation is considered. To assess the difference of the nucleation rate for variants. the interaction energy between the lattice deformation of the variant and the externally applied stress is calculated on the basis of Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) orientation relationship. From the model. both the volumetric and deviatoric strains caused by bainite transformation can be simultaneously obtained.

However. the volume change does not in fact occur isotropically and thus dilatation data contain non-isotropic contributions. In the present study. we expand the conventional analysis model to take into account the effect of non-isotropic volume change. The contribution of the non-isotropic effect to the dilatation data is quantified and is implemented in the analysis model. Dilatometric analysis is conducted on measured dilatation data of low-carbon steels to validate the suggested model. The phase fractions evaluated with the model show a good agreement with those obtained by metallographic analysis.

The possibility of solidification cracking during continuous casting of slabs was predicted using the “Specific Crack Susceptibility”. SSC. The new proposed parameter. SSC. can represent the averaged possibility of solidification cracking of the strand during continuous casting in the mold. The surface crack formed near corner region of strand at the initial stage of solidification. and the internal crack was found in the internal regions of wide center. corner and off-corner at the middle and final stage of solidification. The carbon range sensitive to solidication cracking is between 0.1 wt% C and 0.14 wt% C steels. At the slab widths of 1 900 mm and 2150mm. the possibility of solidification cracking increased in the regions of wide center. corner and offcorner in comparison with the slab width of 1 600 mm. With increasing narrow face taper. the possibility of solidification cracking decreased along the region of wide face due to the mechanical compression imposed by the narrow face taper. With increasing casting speed. the possibility of solidification cracking increased in the regions of wide center. corner and off-corner. because the shell thickness is largely decreased due to decrease of dwelling time of strand within the mold.

Since the low initial reversible capacity of HCNFs is mainly caused by mesopores in the HCNFs. in our approach. the size of these mesopores is reduced by simply introducing a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process between the stabilization and carbonization processes. thereby inducing the deposition of carbon atoms in the mesopores.

Surprisingly. small deformations accomplish large gains in hardness and the dislocation density of martensite. with diminishing returns at larger deformations. The main contribution to the hardness has been identified as the extra dislocations inherited by the martensite from the deformed austenite. rather than the refinement of microstructure by the ausforming process.

Applying a commonly used criterion relating the plane-wave and angular momentum cutoffs. lmax= RMTKmax. where RMT is the muffin-tin (MT) sphere radius and Kmax is the plane-wave cutoff for the basis− the total energy is converged and stable for KmaxRMT= 10. The total energy convergence dependence on the star-function cutoff. Gmax. is minimal and so a Gmax of 3Kmax or a large enough Gmax is a reasonable choice. We demonstrate that the convergence with respect to lmax or a fixed large enough Gmax and Kmax are independent. and that Kmax provides a better measure of the convergence than RMTKmax. The dependence of the total energy on RMT is shown to be small if the core states are treated equivalently. and that the XO scheme is able to treat systems with significantly smaller RMT than the standard LAPW method.

When cycled in TMS-EA solution. the VOx-NT exhibited a higher capacity retention than when cycled in AN solution. The significant degradation of capacity in AN solution resulted from increased charge-transfer resistance caused by the reaction products of the electrolyte during cycling. Mixed TMS-EA solvent systems can increase the cell performance and stability of Mg-electrolytes owing to the higher stability of TMS toward oxidation and the strong Mg-coordination ability of EA.

Introduction of 10s GI was very effective in improving the crystalline quality and interfacial abruptness of InGaN QW layers. and we grew a ten periods of 1-nm-thick In-rich InGaN∕GaN MQW with 10s GI and obtained a strong near-ultraviolet (UV) emission (∼390nm) at room temperature.

We report a correlation between the growth rate of h-BN and the orientation of the nickel grains. The surface of the nickel (Ni) foil was first polished by electrochemical polishing (ECP) and subsequently annealed in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure to suppress the effect of the surface morphology. Atmospheric annealing with hydrogen reduced the nucleation sites of h-BN. which induced a large crystal size mainly grown from the grain boundary with few other nucleation sites in the Ni foil. A higher growth rate was observed from the Ni grains that had the {110} or {100} orientation due to their higher surface energy.,True,HE5L9rgAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,35,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11985,13812712940082289968,/scholar?cites=13812712940082289968,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep11985,0,0,0

The results show that both tensile strength and elongation increase and the balance of tensile strengthelongation are improved upon nitrogen addition to the TRIP steel. It was found that the density of AlN precipitates increases with addition of nitrogen. The volume fraction of retained austenite increases due to AlN precipitation. because the precipitates retard the transformation of austenite during cooling and austempering. As a larger volume fraction of austenite remained after annealing has been transformed to martensite during deformation. elongation as well as strength has increased in the nitrogen added steel. It is also observed that the average grain size of ferrite and bainite decreases because of AlN precipitation that hinders grain growth. The refinement of ferrite and bainite by AlN precipitates also contributes to the increase in the strength of nitrogen added steels.,True,HE5L9rgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,27,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/46/4/46_4_599/_article/-char/ja/,3850570121412724247,/scholar?cites=3850570121412724247,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/46/4/46_4_599/_pdf,0,0,0

The solution-treated lightweight steel samples were aged at 550 °C for various periods of time. The β-Mn phase nucleated at both ferrite/austenite phase boundaries and austenite/austenite grain boundaries after aging for 300 min. and grew extensively into the austenite matrix with lath-type morphology by further aging treatment. Lattice expansion of austenite and κ-carbide after β-Mn precipitation was observed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) peak shift.

Selection of typical operating periods,2014,Samira Fazlollahi and Stephane Laurent Bungener and Pierre Mandel and Gwenaelle Becker and François Maréchal,65,Computers & Chemical Engineering,,54-66,Pergamon,The long term optimization of a district energy system is a computationally demanding task due to the large number of data points representing the energy demand profiles.In order to reduce the number of data points and therefore the computational load of the optimization model. this paper presents a systematic procedure to reduce a complete data set of the energy demand profiles into a limited number of typical periods. which adequately preserve significant characteristics of the yearly profiles. The proposed method is based on the use of a k-means clustering algorithm assisted by an ϵ-constraints optimization technique.

Energy is used to heat or cool water for process use; additionally. water is frequently used in production support or utility networks as steam or cooling water. This enunciates the interconnectedness of water and energy and illustrates the necessity of their simultaneous treatment to improve energy and resource efficiency in industrial processes. Since the seminal work of Savulescu and Smith in 1998 introducing a graphical approach. many authors have contributed to this field by proposing graphically-or optimization-based methodologies. The latter encourages development of mathematical superstructures encompassing all possible interconnections. While a large body of research has focused on improving the superstructure development. solution strategies to tackle such optimization problems have also received significant attention. The goal of the current article is to study the proposed methodologies with special focus on mathematical approaches. their key features and solution strategies. Following the convention of Jeżowski. solution strategies are categorized into: decomposition. sequential. simultaneous. meta-heuristics and a more novel strategy of relaxation/transformation. A detailed. feature-based review of all the main contributions has also been provided in two tables. Several gaps have been highlighted as future research directions.

These common practices limit the ability of researchers to apply novel methods to real cases and understand energy consumption of real industrial plant instances. This is especially pertinent in the field of process integration. as realistic representations of real processes form the basis for the application of novel technologies. Few efforts have been made in this area [1. 2] demonstrating the added value of these profiles; thus. a clear methodology is required for constructing such energy consumption profiles. The method proposed in this work defines an approach for constructing the heat profiles of major industries in a generic way. Parameterized models of several major European industries are presented for defining specific production/plant instances based on contextual specificities to represent different production pathways. The profile construction methodology is described for several situations of data access. Confidentiality issues are addressed by different anonymization techniques such as aggregation. statistical treatment. or by using data which are already publicly available. In this work. data were gathered from real plant operations and validated at higher levels using public information. Although the potential applications and implications of these profiles are clear. two cases are presented to exhibit adaptation of the parameterized models to specific instances and profile use for process integration problems.

This NLP model was combined with a Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) model in order to simultaneously perform optimisation and heat integration of the overall system. The results of a forward-feed evaporation system integrated with hot and cold streams of the evaporation system as well as with the background process were presented. In this paper. the superstructure is extended by including multi-stage flash vessels for improving energy efficiency within the overall system. Additionally. various flow-patterns of heat-integrated MEES are studied. Also. trade-offs between energy and investment costs of heat-integrated MEES are explored for different numbers of evaporation effects in order to determine the optimum number of effects. The proposed Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model of the combined MEES-HEN networks is implemented in a General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and solved simultaneously using a two-step solution strategy. In the first step of the strategy. the NLP model of MEES is solved. providing an initialisation point for solving the MINLP model of the combined MEESHEN network within the second step. A case study of a milk concentration process is used to illustrate the method. The results show that the forward feed flow-pattern with three evaporation effects is totally integrated with hot and cold process streams from the background process. and the system exhibits the minimum Total Annualised Cost (TAC).,True,XgPF1OUAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,8,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/230362,6998828496595912758,/scholar?cites=6998828496595912758,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/230362/files/CET_Vol%2061_PRES17.0473_Final_2017.06.19_unmarked_re-review.pdf,0,0,0

The Conference of Parties in Paris (COP21) highlighted the prominent role of industrial energy efficiency in combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Consumption of energy and material resources. especially water. are strongly interconnected and. therefore. must be treated simultaneously using a holistic approach to identify optimal solutions for efficient processing. Such approaches must consider energy and water recovery within a comprehensive process integration framework which includes options such as organic Rankine cycles for electricity generation from low–medium-temperature heat. This work addresses the importance of holistic approaches by proposing a methodology for simultaneous consideration of heat. mass. and power in industrial processes. The methodology is applied to a kraft pulp mill. In doing so. freshwater consumption is reduced by more than 60%. while net power output is increased by a factor of up to six (from 3.2 MW to between 10–26 MW). The results show that interactions among these elements are complex and therefore underline the necessity of such comprehensive methods to explore their optimal integration with industrial processes.

A comprehensive methodology is required which can easily be incorporated in the planning of industrial clusters. Therefore. a generic hybrid mixed integer linear programming superstructure has been developed to address simultaneous heat. water. and power optimization in interplant operations.

Consumption of energy (mainly in the form of high pressure steam) and water (in the form of process water and cooling water) are essential to all processes and are strongly correlated. which requires development of systematic methodologies to address their interconnectivity. To this end. the subject of heat-integrated water allocation network design has received considerable attention within the research community in recent decades while further growth is expected due to imposed national and global regulations within the context of sustainable development. The overall mathematical model of these networks has a mixed-integer nonlinear programming formulation. As discussed in this work. proposed models in the literature have two main difficulties dealing with heat–water specificities. which result in complex formulations. These difficulties are addressed in this work through proposition of a novel nonlinear hyperstructure and a sequential solution strategy. The solution strategy is to solve three sub-problems sequentially and iteratively generate a set of potential solutions through the implementation of integer cut constraints. The novel mathematical approach also lends itself to an additional innovation for proposing multiple solutions balancing various performance indicators. This is exemplified with both a literature test case and an industrial-scale problem.

The pulp and paper industry is a promising sector for the integration of biorefinery pathways. Among different technologies to produce pulp. the Kraft process accounts for 60% of the worldwide pulp production. The by-products of the Kraft process are major resources of biomass that can further be exploited. In the conventional Kraft process. black liquor is concentrated and burned in recovery boilers in order to satisfy the process heat demands and to recover the chemicals. Almost 40% of the heating demand of the process accounts for evaporators in which the black liquor is concentrated for utilization in the recovery boilers. The aim of this work is to investigate the potential of replacing conventional recovery boilers with a hydrothermal black liquor gasification unit. Hydrothermal gasification allows for having high water content black liquor (near 80%). This leads to an increase in energy efficiency of the process by reducing the overall heating demand (via eliminating the energy-intensive evaporation and concentrations stages) and simultaneously generating syngas that can be further processed into biofuels. In order to evaluate this potential. related process flow sheets are built and thermo-economic optimization of the integrated process is conducted. Furthermore. heat integration among the mill and the biorefinery is performed in order to identify the optimal operating conditions of the process.

Concentrated products can represent final products (fruit and vegetable juices) or intermediate products in cases that crystalized (salt. sugar) or dried (milk powder) final products should be produced. Large amounts of steam and cooling water are consumed in these processes. In order to reduce energy and water consumption within evaporation processes different systems can be applied. namely. multiple-effect evaporation. vapor recompression (thermal and mechanical) or their combinations. Additionally. these processes can be integrated with other process subsystems in order to achieve improved energy and water integration.To address these issues different computer-aided tools have been proposed. However. most studies have focused on analysis and simulation of evaporation processes. Some of the initial studies [1. 2] considered the synthesis of evaporation processes in order to develop tools for computing the minimum utility use for a multiple-effect evaporation system. which was heatintegrated with process hot and cold streams. These studies were based on a modified grand composite curve and heat-path diagram.

Water is often an industrial energy carrier and therefore can be an intermediate heat transfer unit; however. it is also a feedstock or process stream for many industrial processes such as brewing and pulp and paper. In these industries. several unit operations consume or produce water at different quality and temperature levels; ergo. water from the intermediate heat transfer unit (utility network) can be recycled and/or reused in these processes allowing heat recovery and water savings. Furthermore. the efficiency of the energy conversion systems has to be considered in parallel. which implies addressing not only the heat recovery but also the combined heat and power production or the use of heat pumping. The challenge is to first set the problem definition in terms of what information must be extracted. and second. systematically generate the mathematical superstructure that can address these practical complexities. In addition. water storage options are added to the problem and their temperatures optimized to lower the penalty of having restricted connections. The resulting optimization exhibits an integrated process and utility structure for water and heat utilization considering flowrates of varying quality. restricted matches and non-isothermal mixing.

It allows obtaining branched low density polyethylene with characteristics that have not been reproduced by the more modern low or medium pressure polymerizations. The process is carried out under rigorous conditions. For instance. the reactor is operated at very high pressure. between 1300 to 3000 bar at the inlet. The temperature rises from about 50 º C at the reactor inlet to 330 º C at the hottest points due to the exothermic polymerization. Axial velocities are also high. usually around 10 m/s. Besides. the reactor configuration is complex. The main feed usually consists of ethylene and inerts. transfer agents to control the molecular weight. and eventually oxygen as initiator. Most of the polymerization reaction. however. is initiated by peroxides that are fed to the reactor through lateral injections. Monomer and/or transfer agents can also be fed through side injections. The polymerization takes place in short reaction zones following the peroxides injections. exhibiting high heat generation. The rest of the reactor is mainly used as a heat exchanger. in order to reach appropriate temperatures for peroxides addition or for downstream units. The control of the reaction mixture temperature is achieved by circulating vapor or liquid water through different jacket zones. which may be interconnected or not.

1185078,Environomic multi-objective optimization of an eco-industrial park,2015,Lindsay Lessard and Pierre Collet and Maziar Kermani and François Maréchal,,,CONF,,,A circular economy refers to an industrial economy with a cradle to cradle vision. shifting from the use of fossil fuels towards renewable energy. minimizing the use of toxic chemicals and reducing waste by recycling through careful system design. The concept of a circular economy is based on the study of non-linear. in particular living systems. with a major outcome being the optimisation of systems rather than of the individual components which make up each system [1]. Industrial symbiosis (IS) is the exchange of energy. waste and by-products [2] among industries in order to add value. while reducing costs and environmental impacts [3]. This is consistent with the principles of a circular economy. and is a stepping stone towards the design of sustainable economies and policies.In the scope of the following study. the use of local and renewable resources and the development of industrial ecology can contribute to the decrease of environmental impacts of a living. interactive system. on a given territory.

These common practices limit the ability of researchers to apply novel methods to real cases and understand energy consumption of real industrial plant instances. This is especially pertinent in the field of process integration. as realistic representations of real processes form the basis for the application of novel technologies. Few efforts have been made in this area [1. 2] demonstrating the added value of these profiles; thus. a clear methodology is required for constructing such energy consumption profiles. The method proposed in this work defines an approach for constructing the heat profiles of major industries in a generic way. Parameterized models of several major European industries are presented for defining specific production/plant instances based on contextual specificities to represent different production pathways. The profile construction methodology is described for several situations of data access. Confidentiality issues are addressed by different anonymization techniques such as aggregation. statistical treatment. or by using data which are already publicly available. In this work. data were gathered from real plant operations and validated at higher levels using public information.

Process integration methods have proven to be effective tools in improving industrial sites while decreasing their resource and energy consumption; however. location aspects and their impact are generally overlooked. This paper presents a method based on process integration. which considers the location of plants. The impact of the locations is included within the mixed integer linear programming framework in the form of heat losses. temperature and pressure drop. and piping cost. The objective function is selected as minimisation of the total cost of the system excluding piping cost and ϵ-constraints are applied on the piping cost to systematically generate multiple solutions. The method is applied to a case study with industrial plants from different sectors. First. the interaction between two plants and their utility integration are illustrated. depending on the piping cost limit which results in the heat pump and boiler on one site being gradually replaced by excess heat recovered from the other plant. Then. the optimisation of the whole system is carried out. as a large-scale application. At low piping cost allowances. heat is shared through high pressure steam in above-ground pipes. while at higher piping cost limits the system switches toward lower pressure steam sharing in underground pipes. Compared to the business-as-usual operation of the sites. the optimal solution obtained with the proposed method leads to 20% reduction in the overall cost of the system. including the piping cost.

However. large investments are required to retrofit existing industrial plants. which remains the largest barrier to implementing energy saving solutions. Process integration methods can be used to identify the best investments to improve the efficiency of plants. yet their timing remains to be answered using an optimisation approach. Even more critically. such decisions must also account for future investments to avoid stranded or regretted investments. This paper presents a method incorporating investment planning over long time horizons in the framework of process integration. The time horizon is included by formulating the problem using multiple investment periods. Investment planning is conducted using a superstructure approach. which permits both commissioning and decommissioning of units in the beginning of each period. The method is applied to a large case study. with an industrial cluster neighbouring an urban centre to also explore options of heat integration between industries and cities. Compared to the business-as-usual operation. optimal investment planning improves the operating cost of the system by 27% without budget constraints and 16–26% with constraints on budget and investment periods. which is reflected as an increase in net present value and a decrease in CO 2 emissions.

This work uses heat signature models and climate data to build a parameterized residential sector profile for different climatic zones in Europe. The sector profile is validated using Rotterdam.

This work demonstrates the usefulness of the residential profile by applying process integration techniques within a mixed integer linear programming formulation to evaluate optimal energy conversion technologies for different district energy networks and potential waste heat recovery from industrial plants located in the vicinity of the residential area. The results show that switching to a fully electric energy providing system can lead to operating cost savings of 48% and CO2emission savings up to 100%. depending on the mix of electricity generation.

Thus. heat recovery is one of the main focuses in industrial energy efficiency problems. Heat integration (HI) techniques have been studied extensively to solve such problems. One of the main drawbacks of the classical heat integration approaches is that heat can be transferred from any stream to another as long as it flows from higher temperature intervals to lower ones. which results in impractical scenarios. in which heat is recovered over long distances. This work proposes a heat integration method which takes into account heat distribution losses. The heat losses are calculated as a function of the distance between the original location of the stream and the location it is used and the supply and return temperatures.

As a result international protocols. such as the Paris agreement. are signed setting ambitious targets on both energy consumption and CO2 emissions. As industry is the responsible for a high share in energy consumption and environmental impact. such international treaties. combined with the regional and country based regulations put the industrial sector in the spotlight for energy and resource efficiency improvements.This thesis explores the issues that have been overlooked in the domain of industrial energy and resource efficiency. The first two chapters look at the energy consumption at the plant level. while the remaining chapters also consider interactions between plants. in the context of an industrial cluster. Chapter 1 presents the concept of heat exchange interfaces to assess the cost of heat integration within industrial plants at early design stages. Switching from one interface to another is linked to modifying existing heat exchangers and to the cost of additional heat exchange area requirement. An optimisation method is developed to consider the trade-off between the cost of switching interfaces and the operational benefits due to better heat integration.

Measurements were made in three perpendicular directions to investigate anisotropic properties. Most materials were found to display higher in-plane permeability than through-plane permeability. The permeability in the two perpendicular in-plane directions was found to display significant anisotropy. Materials with the most highly aligned fibers showed the highest anisotropy and the permeability could differ by as much as a factor of 2.

All models were validated with experimental data for H2–H2O–Ar and CO–CO2 systems. The effect of pore size on all model predictions was discussed. It was concluded that the dusty-gas model is the most appropriate model to simulate gas transport phenomena inside a SOFC anode. However. this model requires numerical solution. whereas Fick’s and Stefan–Maxwell’s do not. It was found that the SMM. rather than the FM. is a good approximation of the dusty-gas model for H2–H2O system. except in the case of high current density. low H2 concentration and low porosity. where only the DGM is recommended.

To accomplish this. surplus or intermittent power is used to produce hydrogen via water electrolysis. As hydrogen is an energy vector. converting the power into gaseous hydrogen is considered to be an effective energy storage alternative. Previous studies attempt to qualitatively compare energy storage technologies considering criteria such as market maturity. efficiency. and cost. and include energy storage systems such as electrochemical batteries. pumped hydro or compressed air energy storage systems.

However. in electric vehicles. batteries experience a dynamic operational environment whereby the simple algorithms employed in the portable devices to predict SOC. such as coulomb counting. are insufficient for this purpose. To address this problem. a Kalman filtering method is used to estimate the state of the charge of two different commercial lithium-ion batteries. with new physical insight being provided through an analysis of the Kalman filter covariance noise parameters. For example. the effect of geometry of the battery on value of these parameters is discussed. Different models are developed. tested and incorporated in the filter design.

Canada,2011,Christina E Hoicka and Ian H Rowlands,36,Renewable Energy,1,97-107,Pergamon,In Ontario (Canada). the integration of renewable power is a priority policy goal. Since 2004. the circumstances under which the integration of renewable power is evaluated have changed due to successive changes in price as well as concerns that its over-production may add to grid congestion. This research investigates the value of increasing complementarity (both proximate and geographically dispersed) of wind and solar resources as a means by which electricity planners and researchers might advance electricity sustainability in Ontario. More specifically. this paper asks the following questions: 1) Does the combination of solar and wind resources in selected locations in Ontario serve to ‘smooth out’ power production. i.e.. decrease instances of both high and low values. as compared to either resource producing individually? 2) Can this ‘smoothness’ be further improved by dispersing these resources …,True,o7EgO1kAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,156,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148110002600,12800319016323360303,/scholar?cites=12800319016323360303,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51197669/j.renene.2010.06.00420170105-21277-hkgmsx.pdf,0,0,0

The investigation focuses upon Exxon and BP Amoco—two of the world's largest oil companies. The differences between the two. with regard to their attitudes and actions on global climate change. are striking: whereas Exxon is continuing to act as one might initially expect (resisting proactive policies on climate change). BP Amoco appears more willing to contemplate a world that uses less oil. Attempts to explain these differences focus upon the companies' respective interests. their management structures. and their nationalities.

THE WORLD'S states are faced with a new threat to security. Encompassing the problems of depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. the issue of global environmental change is quickly accelerating toward the top of the international political agenda. National leaders are beginning to recognize and acknowledge the links that exist between the natural earth and the anthropocentric world. Thus. they are compelled to take account of the impact that their decisions will have upon the environment—and vice versa. In this way. the political consequences of global environmental change are beginning to be felt.

In contribution to that discussion. it can be shown that different rules for the allocation of future greenhouse gas emissions (themselves generated by different conceptions of ‘justice') envision widely disparate actions for the various OECD countries. In light of these differences. it can be argued that a twin‐track strategy should be followed: a short‐term agreement should be based upon a traditional ‘flat‐rate’ approach. but the promise of a ‘differentiated’ approach encourages further debate about its application in the longer term.,True,o7EgO1kAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,50,https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644019708414340,11655884193562015648,/scholar?cites=11655884193562015648,,,0,0,0

The first procedure is an availability procedure that looks at the wind characteristics and its probable energy capturing profile. This profile of wind enables the probable maximum operating wind velocity profile for a selected wind turbine design to be predicted. The structured procedures allow for a consequent adjustment. sorting and grouping of the measured wind velocity data taken at different time intervals and hub heights. The second procedure is the adequacy procedure that investigates the probable degree of availability and the application consequences. Both procedures are programmed using MathCAD symbolic mathematical software.

This study uses numerical and experimental analyses to investigate the reduction in the operating temperature of PV panels with an air-cooled heat sink. The proposed heat sink was designed as an aluminum plate with perforated fins that is attached to the back of the PV panel. A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted using the software ANSYS Fluent to ensure that the heat sink model worked properly. The influence of heat sinks on the heat transfer between a PV panel and the circulating ambient air was investigated. The results showed a substantial decrease in the operating temperature of the PV panel and an increase in its electrical performance. The CFD analysis in the heat sink model with an air flow velocity of 1.5 m/s and temperature of 35°C under a heat flux of 1000 W/m2 showed a decrease in the PV panel’s average temperature from 85.3°C to 72.8°C. As a consequence of decreasing its temperature. the heat sink increased the open-circuit photovoltage () and maximum power point () of the PV panel by 10% and 18.67%. respectively. Therefore. the use of aluminum heat sinks could provide a potential solution to prevent PV panels from overheating and may indirectly lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions due to the increased electricity production from the PV system.,True,OBUM3JcAAAAJ:NMxIlDl6LWMC,13,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,11063058355765537488,/scholar?cites=11063058355765537488,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,0,0,0

Vibration analysis was performed by measuring vibration in centrifugal pump impellers which were damaged at the end of their blades and impellers that were damaged on one of their blades. then compare it with the vibrations generated by the impeller which had a good conditions. Vibration measurement was performed on 1500 rpm with data retrieval of accelerometer sensor direction at axial direction. and radial. Vibration measurements will produce a time domain signal. which would then be converted into the frequency domain spectrum using the Fast Fourier Transform on Matlab Software.

Although training programs have become routine activities provided by the government every year and inmates are trained in various skills in preparation for their after-free. some still choose to return to the criminal world. Empirical studies show that there are two main causes. namely (1) the training program is given to make them skilled workers that after they acquire freedom no company will hire former prisoners.(2) there are constraints such as capital and knowledge emerge as for those starting and running a business.

This study uses numerical and experimental analyses to investigate the reduction in the operating temperature of PV panels with an air-cooled heat sink. The proposed heat sink was designed as an aluminum plate with perforated fins that is attached to the back of the PV panel. A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted using the software ANSYS Fluent to ensure that the heat sink model worked properly. The influence of heat sinks on the heat transfer between a PV panel and the circulating ambient air was investigated. The results showed a substantial decrease in the operating temperature of the PV panel and an increase in its electrical performance. The CFD analysis in the heat sink model with an air flow velocity of 1.5 m/s and temperature of 35°C under a heat flux of 1000 W/m2 showed a decrease in the PV panel’s average temperature from 85.3°C to 72.8°C. As a consequence of decreasing its temperature. the heat sink increased the open-circuit photovoltage () and maximum power point () of the PV panel by 10% and 18.67%. respectively. Therefore. the use of aluminum heat sinks could provide a potential solution to prevent PV panels from overheating and may indirectly lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions due to the increased electricity production from the PV system.,True,3xwvRDYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,13,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,11063058355765537488,/scholar?cites=11063058355765537488,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,0,0,0

1185221,Role of urea addition in the preparation of tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles using flame-assisted spray pyrolysis,2008,Yoshitake Terashi and Agus Purwanto and Wei-Ning Wang and Ferry Iskandar and Kikuo Okuyama,28,Journal of the European Ceramic Society,13,2573-2580,Elsevier,In this study. flame-assisted spray pyrolysis (FASP) was used to produce BaTiO3 nanoparticles with relatively high tetragonality and controlled sizes from 23 to 33 nm in a one-step process. The addition of urea into the precursor is the key factor for the formation of tetragonal BaTiO3 nanoparticles; the lack of urea addition led to the formation of submicrometer BaTiO3. The formation of BaTiO3 nanoparticles was suggested from the disintegration of submicrometer particles due to the decomposition of urea presented in the interconnection of their primary particles. Also. combustion of the decomposed gases of urea produced additional heat. which improved the tetragonality of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles. Tetragonality was enhanced from 1.0051 to 1.0071 by increasing the urea addition to as high as 4 M. The results of the present study show that addition of urea to the precursor is an effective strategy for the direct …,True,cIGHN8cAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955221908001258,6269220685928508505,/scholar?cites=6269220685928508505,,,0,0,0

Mg-chlorophyll was then synthesized into Fe-chlorophyll to improve stability. The natural dyes were characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectrometry. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. and cyclic voltammetry. The performance of DSSCs was tested using a solar simulator. The results showed the open-circuit voltage. the short-circuit current density. and the efficiency of the extracted papaya leaves-based DSSCs to be 325 mV. 0.36 mA/cm2. and 0.07%. respectively. Furthermore. the DSSCs with purified chlorophyll provide high open-circuit voltage of 425 mV and short-circuit current density of 0.45 mA/cm2. The use of Fe-chlorophyll for sensitizing the DSSCs increases the efficiency up to 2.5 times and the stability up to two times. The DSSCs with Fe-chlorophyll dyes provide open-circuit voltage. short-circuit current density. and efficiency of 500 mV. 0.62 mA/cm2. and 0.16%. respectively.

In order to enhance the evaporation process five different types of porous media had been chosen. namely concrete consisted river sand with the particle size of 0.125 and 0.250 mm. ferrous sand concrete with particle size of 0.125 and 0.250 mm. and natural stone as the comparison material. Top side of the specimens was exposed in a heater with 18.2 W. 27.3 W and 36.4 W. The bottom side of specimen was exposed in seawater which fl owed capillary and evaporated. The value of thermal conductivity and porosity in porous media greatly affect the temperature distribution caused by the heat transfer process. Specimens with smaller particle size has a higher thermal conductivity which resulting in a larger heat transfer rate. Concrete with ferrous sand as aggregate has a better heat transfer rate than river sand specimen. The largest heat transfer rate obtained in concrete with 0.125 mm ferrous sand with the value of 0.256 W. 0.402 W and 0.524 W in every power addition. The rate of mass transfer value equals to the rate of evaporation that occurs and strongly depends on the capillary force of each specimen. The evaporation rate data is proportional to the heat transfer rate of each specimen. However the natural stone specimen has a higher evaporation rate than expected due to better interconnectivities between its channels.,True,mvA5-gwAAAAJ:hMsQuOkrut0C,6,https://scindeks.ceon.rs/Article.aspx?artid=1451-41171901008I,8071315898637067450,/scholar?cites=8071315898637067450,,http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/1451-4117/2019/1451-41171901008I.pdf,0,0,0

The tests to discern the field-dependent properties are undertaken using both rotational and oscillatory shear rheometers. As a first step. the MR grease is developed by dispersing the carbonyl iron (CI) particles into grease medium with a mechanical stirrer. Experimental data are obtained by changing the magnetic field from 0 to 0.7 T at room temperature of 25 C. It is found that a strong Payne effect limits the linear viscoelastic region of MR grease at strains above 0.1%.

Thus. these unique properties are very promising. particularly for the detection of various types of chemicals. for example boric acid which is a non-permitted preservative employed in food preparations. For the sensing material. gold (Au) nanoplates with a variety of shapes. ie. triangular. hexagonal. truncated pentagon and flat rod. were prepared using a seed-mediated growth method. The yield of Au nanoplates was estimated to be ca. 63% over all areas of the sensing material. The nanoplates produced two absorption bands. ie. the transverse surface plasmon resonance (t-SPR) and the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (l-SPR) at 545 nm and 710 nm. respectively. In the sensing study. these two bands were used to examine the response of gold nanoplates to the presence of boric acid in an aqueous environment. In a typical process. when the sample is immersed into an aqueous solution containing boric acid. these two bands may change their intensity and peak centers as a result of the interaction between the boric acid and the gold nanoplates. The changes in the intensities and peak positions of t-SPR and l-SPR linearly correlated with the change in the boric acid concentration in the solution.

The TiO 2 HFs were prepared by co-axial electrospinning and used as the light-scattering layer in the DSSC. The thickness variations of the TiO 2 NP and Zn-doped TiO 2 HF photoanode layers affect the performance of the DSSC. especially the short-circuit photocurrent density. The thickness of the TiO 2 NP layer significantly affected the absorbance of photons and N719 dye molecules in the double-layer photoanode. while that of the Zn-doped TiO 2 HF layer affected the scattering of light. as indicated by the low light transmittance in the photoanode.

This study uses numerical and experimental analyses to investigate the reduction in the operating temperature of PV panels with an air-cooled heat sink. The proposed heat sink was designed as an aluminum plate with perforated fins that is attached to the back of the PV panel. A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted using the software ANSYS Fluent to ensure that the heat sink model worked properly. The influence of heat sinks on the heat transfer between a PV panel and the circulating ambient air was investigated. The results showed a substantial decrease in the operating temperature of the PV panel and an increase in its electrical performance. The CFD analysis in the heat sink model with an air flow velocity of 1.5 m/s and temperature of 35°C under a heat flux of 1000 W/m2 showed a decrease in the PV panel’s average temperature from 85.3°C to 72.8°C. As a consequence of decreasing its temperature. the heat sink increased the open-circuit photovoltage () and maximum power point () of the PV panel by 10% and 18.67%. respectively. Therefore. the use of aluminum heat sinks could provide a potential solution to prevent PV panels from overheating and may indirectly lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions due to the increased electricity production from the PV system.,True,fv1fLM4AAAAJ:GtLg2Ama23sC,13,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,11063058355765537488,/scholar?cites=11063058355765537488,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,0,0,0

Although they have an advantage of being used for non-destructive in-situ measurement. it has a substantial problem that the measured results are influenced by thermal contact between the probe and the specimen. To overcome this problem. we proposed a new technique using a gel to eliminate the contact resistance. A unique feature of the method is that a thin film heater is fabricated on a substrate at the bottom of a shallow cavity. which provides a gel layer of the thickness that is almost the same as the cavity depth. When we use this sensor. we press it against a surface of a specimen with a gel in between. We named it"" stamp sensor"" from its supposed use and appearance. The thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity of a specimen and the thickness of the gel layer are determined simultaneously by comparing the measured temperature rise of the sensor with that obtained by numerical analysis. The objective of the present paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of the method by virtual experiments. The process to determine the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity was examined using simulated experimental data that have been generated from the temperature rise of the sensor obtained by numerical analyses with given artificial scattering.

Thus. these unique properties are very promising. particularly for the detection of various types of chemicals. for example boric acid which is a non-permitted preservative employed in food preparations. For the sensing material. gold (Au) nanoplates with a variety of shapes. ie. triangular. hexagonal. truncated pentagon and flat rod. were prepared using a seed-mediated growth method. The yield of Au nanoplates was estimated to be ca. 63% over all areas of the sensing material. The nanoplates produced two absorption bands. ie. the transverse surface plasmon resonance (t-SPR) and the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (l-SPR) at 545 nm and 710 nm. respectively. In the sensing study. these two bands were used to examine the response of gold nanoplates to the presence of boric acid in an aqueous environment. In a typical process. when the sample is immersed into an aqueous solution containing boric acid. these two bands may change their intensity and peak centers as a result of the interaction between the boric acid and the gold nanoplates. The changes in the intensities and peak positions of t-SPR and l-SPR linearly correlated with the change in the boric acid concentration in the solution.

When a staple food is shortage in market. it will trigger crisis of economics. political and social because it concerns with food security. This paper develops a buffer stock model for stabilizing price of commodity under limited time of supply and continuous consumption. The performance criterion of model will consider financial loss of producer. consumer and government side when market is interfered by price-stabilization program and price-support program simultaneously. The price fluctuation will be stabilized by market operation where buffer stocks are bought from domestic and import supply point. This paper provides a price band policy that attempts to bound domestic price variation between a set of upper and lower bounds on the level of domestic prices. We consider three sets of problems reflecting different three prices elasticity from 4 period of supply and demand.

Measurement strategy requires feasible variables that make up those goals. This strategy also ensures that all variables that are important in measuring contribute to the larger goals. A useful way to assess and explain the effectiveness of the technology transfer office (TTO) of universities is to model this within a production function/frontier framework. Such a production function is typically estimated econometrically. This study presents evidence on the relative efficiency of research commercialization in the university through the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The implication of the DEA efficiency result is to derive the efficiency level of the TTO’s strategy from the observed performance. It also helps in identifying the benchmarking of other TTOs. which would be valuable information for improving their new technology commercialization strategy. In detail. a benchmark is provided to improve the weakness of strategy and resource allocation of a poorly performing TTO. The proposed matrix of indicators is an exploit of how performance could be measured within the decision-making units that have been chosen.

Air sebagai fluida pemindah kalor (heat transfer fluid. HTF) dan paraffin wax digunakan bersamasama untuk menyimpan kalor di dalam tangki. Paraffin wax dimasukkan ke dalam sekumpulan kapsul berbentuk silinder dan disusun secara horisontal serta segaris. Kolektor sebagai pengumpul energi matahari dihubungkan dengan tangki PATS. Sistem PATS dihadapkan dengan matahari sehingga terjadi proses pemanasan (charging) dimana HTF dan PCM akan bertambah temperaturnya akibat transfer kalor dari air kolektor. Temperatur HTF dan PCM direkam selama proses charging. Data temperatur digunakan untuk menyelidiki penyimpanan energi termal di dalam tangki. Hasil pengujian menunjukkan bahwa kapasitas penyimpanan energi termal total PATS terbesar adalah 4.8 MJ dan kontribusi dari penggunaan PCM adalah 44.28% selama waktu charging 340 menit. Selain itu. energi tersimpan kumulatif terbesar yang diperoleh selama proses charging adalah 3.97 MJ. Perbedaan antara kapasitas penyimpanan energi dan energi tersimpan kumulatif merupakan energi yang terbuang ke lingkungan.

Several techniques can be used in the process. including conventional and microwave drying. Drying of oil palm solid waste aims to improve its physical properties. The study used a 10 g sample for each drying test. The drying process was performed on six variations of the drying temperature. ie. 40. 45. 50. 55. 60. and 65℃. The temperatures used for heating started from ambient temperature to the predetermined drying temperatures. then it was held for 90 minutes. The measurement of the mass was performed every 20 seconds. Based on the result. it can be concluded that drying using a microwave oven gives higher effectiveness compared to drying using a conventional oven. The high drying temperature affects not only the drying rate constant throughout a constant time but also the drying rate constant during the falling rate period. For both methods. the drying rate has been found to be linearly proportional to the drying temperature. The increasing drying temperature will decrease energy intensity.

It has been found that the production of Ti+ is enhanced by a high gas pressure. The peak of the Ti+ density is located at a distance of 4–5 cm from the target surface. indicating the gas-phase production of Ti+ in the downstream plasma. Since the plasma density and the electron temperature measured using a Langmuir probe are low in the downstream plasma. this result suggests that the dominant production process of Ti+ is not electron impact ionization of Ti (Ti+ e→ Ti+ e+ e).

Bandung Institute of Techonolgy. Indonesia,The study is objected to investigate the response of a magnetorheological brake (MRB) system under thefree move inertial mass. The disk-type MRB comprises of a rotating disk immersed in magnetorheological fluids (MRFs) and surrounded by an electromagnet coil. The magnetized coil causes a solidification of the MR fluid so that the shear stress between the moving part and static part increases resulting in the decrement speed of the moving parts. The shear stress can be varied by applying different electric current to the coil. The study began with the part design using the3D modeling software. followingbythe magnetostatic analysis. The flux density across the magnetorheological fluid could be predicted through this finite element magnetic simulation. The quantity of magnetic flux was then used to predict the shear stress between static and moving parts. The fabricated MRB was integrated onto a test rig which employs load cell and speed sensor as well as completely instrumented with data acquisition. Since the MRB test rig performed a simple free rotation system. a linear second order differential equation was derived to model the stopping time and braking torque behaviors. The equation of motion was built in a Simulink model. and the simulation results were compared to the real measurement.

However. in the current competitive environment. the drawbacks become salient; hence security assessment based on the concept of risk is required. Risk assessment is an approach that quantitatively captures the factors that determine security level. namely likelihood and the severity of events. Risk index is used to quantify the degree of risk of the given operating condition. This paper presents risk based static security assessment on a practical interconnected power system at various loading condition using a risk index.

Dynamic voltage collapse prediction is first determined based on the PTSI calculated from information in dynamic simulation output. Simulations were carried out on a practical 87 bus test system by considering load increase as the contingency. The data collected from the time domain simulation is then used as input to the SVM in which support vector regression is used as a predictor to determine the dynamic voltage collapse indices of the power system. To reduce training time and improve accuracy of the SVM. the Kernel function type and Kernel parameter are considered. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SVM method. its performance is compared with the multi layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN).

There are three main area considerations in load shedding schemes as the amount of load to be shed. the timing of load shedding event. and the location where load shed is to be shed. The proposed method. named as adaptive UVLS based PTSI seem to be most appropriate among the uncoordinated schemes. From the simulation result can be shown the Adaptive UVLS based PTSI give faster response. accurate and very sensitive control for the UVLS control technique. This technique is effectively when calculating the amount to be shed. Therefore. it is possible to bring the voltage to the threshold value in one step.

1185656,An Experimental Investigation of Basin Type Single Slope Solar Still having Multiple Floating Wicks in the Basin,2017,Madhup Kumar Guide Mittal,,,,,,The demand of water has increased considerably due to growth in population and industries. In coastal regions and arid areas. abundant amount of sea water or slightly saline water is available but there is scarcity of potable water. The most economical method to overcome this scarcity of water is use of solar still. which converts brackish water into potable one without using any conventional source of energy. The main drawback associated with solar stills is their low productivity. In the present work. a single slope basin type solar still has been modified by placing multiple float wicks in the basin of the still. The float wick was made by wrapping black cotton cloth on thermocol sheet having protective layer of polyurethane foam to avoid any burn out due to high temperature. The basin area of the still was 1.15 m2 and transparent glass cover of 5 mm thickness was inclined at an angle nearly equal to latitude of Patiala. The performance of modified still has been compared with the conventional basin type still of identical specifications under same ambient conditions. The effects of covering basin area of the still with float wick in different proportions and varying basin water depths on the productivity of still have been investigated. The use of float wicks reduced thermal inertia of the basin leading to early response and higher operating temperatures which resulted in enhanced distillate outputs of the modified still as compared to the conventional still. The modified still performed better. when basin area of the still was partially covered with float wick because of availability of path for heat transfer between warm basin water and top surface of wick during …,True,INHbbdwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/handle/10266/4700,,,,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/bitstream/10266/4700/4/4700.PDF,0,0,0

For the production of snow. a wooden prototype of snow making machine was built having three main units named as water basin. nucleation chamber and moisture trap. After fabrication. the machine was kept inside the cold laboratory. where a low temperature surrounding environment was provided. This machine is based on the common supersaturation principle of blowing cold unsaturated air over a heated water basin that increases the temperature and moisture content of air. The moist air stream is directed into the nucleation chamber. where it gets cooled and the process of nucleation of ice crystals is started on the stretched nylon wire. During the experiments. the temperature of the cold laboratory was varied from -20℃ to -35℃. whereas the temperature of the water basin was maintained at 25℃. The snow crystals formed inside the nucleation chamber were mainly dendritic in nature. The temperature variation and the production rate of snow was measured at all laboratory temperatures ranges from (-20℃ to -35℃) with 5℃ temperature decrement. The average values of snow production rate inside the nucleation chamber at all the give values of laboratory temperatures were found to be 72 g/h. 108.76 g/h. 142.64 g/h and 178.53 g/h.

1185659,Design of binary and ternary nitrate salt mixtures for energy storage and heat transfer in solar thermal systems,2016,Abhishek Upadhyay and Madhup Kumar Guide Mittal,,,,,,The objective of the present study is to obtain molten salt having higher thermal stability. reduced cost and relatively lower melting point as compared to previously available molten salts. A very large range of molten blends of alkali nitrates are inspected by experimental approach. Since the determination of eutectic concentration. melting point and phase diagram from experimental methods are usually costly and time consuming; therefore it is of interest to predict the same by using some numerical method. In this work. the numerical method based on regular solution theory is used to predict eutectic concentration and melting point of the binary and ternary systems consisting of NaNO3. KNO3 and LiNO3 salts. The melting points of binary and ternary systems are also determined experimentally using Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) and then they are compared with those predicted by the numerical method. Thermo-Gravimetric analysis (TGA) is also used to determine thermal stability of three binary and a ternary mixtures at various temperature. The experimental values obtained from instruments are found to be in good agreement with the predicted values obtained from numerical method.  The experimental results show that the ternary salt studied in this work has a melting point of 121°C. This salt mixture is thermally stable up to temperature of 534°C and can be used up to a temperature of 608°C for a short period of time. This ternary salt mixture is also cost effective due to lower concentration of lithium nitrate in the salt mixture.,True,INHbbdwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/handle/10266/3967,,,,http://117.203.246.91:8080/jspui/bitstream/10266/3967/4/3967.pdf,0,0,0

However. radiative and convective losses occur across the entire receiver circumference. This paper attempts to introduce the idea employing transparent heat mirror to effectively reduce the heat loss area and thus improve the thermal efficiency of the solar collector. Transparent heat mirror essentially has high transmissivity in the solar irradiance wavelength band and high reflectivity in the mid-infrared region thus it allows the solar irradiance to pass through but reflects the infrared radiation back to the solar selective metal tube.

Moreover. the increase in demand for comfort and over occupation of public places put undue pressure on air conditioning system and hence pressure on energy sources. Therefore. the need of the hour is to develop such system which should be more energy efficient.  The major load on the conventional air condition systems is the latent heat load i.e. the removal of the moisture from the outdoor air to improve the standard of the supply air. This load can be separated from the air-conditioning system by using Desiccant Technology in combination with conventional air-conditioning system. This leads to the development of Desiccant-Vapour Compression Hybrid Air Conditioning System. In the present study a methodology has been presented for the study of the parameters which affect the working of the heart and soul of desiccant system i.e. the dehumidifier. An analytical mathematical model has been developed for the dehumidifier by using various property and conservation equations. In this study Lithium Chloride solution has been used as the desiccant and the model shows good agreement with the experimental results obtained by the previous researchers.

The performance of the photovoltaic panels is affected by factors such as partial shading. elevated temperature. mismatch between the cell parameters. etc.. which contribute to the loss in an inter-correlated manner. In the current study. we isolate the contribution from each factor through experiments. The partial shading is configured through distributed paper chips in different patterns keeping the overall shaded area constant. The isolation of shading loss from the total loss allows us to find out the total contribution from the mismatch and temperature factors. In a further set of experiments. we isolate these two factors as well. We find that the major contribution comes from the shading loss. We also observe that not only the fraction of the partial shading but also the shading …,True,9D1MWBMAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-5955-6_66,5298846977305005379,/scholar?cites=5298846977305005379,,https://www.academia.edu/download/62214261/ICAER2019_17620200227-77562-18eh4a2.pdf,0,0,0

For the time scale of a day for few days. sensible heat storage with low thermal inertia is a reasonable choice which has the advantage of fast kinetics and lower cost compared to the latent heat or thermochemical routes. In an earlier study. it has been demonstrated experimentally that the sensible heat storage can be made more efficient by modularization. However. the real potential of modular heat storage is experienced with high temperature heat with significant temperature variations. Here. we simulate such heat storage processes for realistic solar thermal heat profile and compare the performance of multi-tank modular system with that of conventional single tank system.

Results of performance studies on packed bed solar collector are available in literature in which different operating conditions have been considered which make it difficult to compare their performance accurately. Considering this comparative study of performance of solar collector with different packing elements has been made in the present work. Experimental investigations on solar collector packed with iron chips. wire mesh. gravels and glass balls for the same set of operating parameter have been done on a single setup to study the effect of packing material and its geometry on the thermal efficiency of packed bed collector. It is observed that iron chips packed collector is identified as the best packing materials out of the materials selected for study leading to thermal efficiency of 76.21% for the mass flow rate of 0.035 kg/s and porosity of 0.945. which is 69.58% higher as compared to smooth collector.

One such form of energy is solar energy. which has got great potential especially for countries like India because of abundant insolation available due to their geographical location. The utilization of this form of energy can easily be achieved for low temperature applications using flat plate solar collectors. which have a wide range of applications viz. domestic and industrial water heating. drying of agricultural products such as fruits and grains. green house chambers. space heating. solar refrigeration and air conditioning etc. Conventional solar air collectors have inherent disadvantages viz low thermal efficiency due to low value of specific heat of air. In order to increase the thermal efficiency of conventional collectors different techniques have been proposed for thermal performance improvement [1-6]. These techniques include enhancement of heat transfer coefficient between absorber plate to working fluid and reduction of top losses etc.The enhancement of heat transfer coefficient can be achieved in several ways. such as the use of artificial roughness which disturbs the viscous boundary layer of the flowing fluid and thus augmenting the heat transfer rates. Use of finned plate absorber surface causes an increase in the turbulence of air flowing through the duct. increasing the thermal performance with limited increase in pressure drop.

A detailed coupled heat and mass transfer (CHMT) model and a lumped parameter (LP) model are implemented to estimate the Specific Cooling Power (SCP) of an adsorption cooling system using silica gel/water as the working pair. It is found that the optimal cycle time can be predicted by using the LP model. Results show that the SCP obtained from the CHMT model is always higher than that measured from the experiment because the dynamic effect of the evaporator is not considered. The LP model. with its input parameters estimated by the CHMT. actually produces reliable estimates of the SCP because the evaporator dynamic effect is considered.

Therefore. there is a requirement to analyze the transient behavior of such MED systems. In this work. a dynamic model is developed and used to examine the effect of abrupt and ramp changes in the main operational parameters on the plant behavior and performance. The results show that the disturbance intensity variation has a major role in the desalination plant behavior. For the current MED-TVC configuration. it is recommended to limit the reduction in the seawater cooling flow rate to under 12% of the designed steady-state value to avoid dry out in the evaporators. A reduction in the motive steam flow rate and cooling seawater temperature of more than 20% and 35% of the nominal operating values. respectively. may lead to flooding in the evaporators and a complete plant shutdown.

The present results indicate that the heat diffusion and vapor penetration depths can be used to specify the desired working pair properties and the adsorbent layer thickness for producing the maximum cooling power.

The bed is modular in nature and thus can be scaled for a given cooling load. An experimental setup is built to measure the adsorption kinetics of the proposed bed under typical operating conditions. In addition. a transient three-dimensional local thermal equilibrium (LTE) model is developed to study heat and mass transfer inside the bed. The Darcy equation and linear driving force (LDF) model are solved simultaneously to account for inter-particle and intra-particle mass diffusion. respectively. Silica gel RD-2060/water is chosen as the working pair. The influence of the bed porosity. bed thickness. bed height and convective heat transfer coefficient on the specific cooling power (SCP) is investigated. Good agreement between the experimental measurements and the numerical results is obtained. The results show that a reduction in the bed porosity increases the adsorbent density and leads to a lower SCP. Additionally. a decrease in the bed thickness results in a pronounced increase in the SCP. However. a small bed thickness means a small module size. which leads to a high parasitic penalty in the metal-to-adsorbent mass ratio. The SCP is found to be insensitive to the convective heat transfer coefficient when it is over 400 W/m 2· K. because the dominant thermal resistance is due to the low thermal conductivity of the adsorbent.

However. conventional ways of pH control are not reversible. which can cause continuous changes in cellular and biological behaviours and are harmful to the host. Utilizing a photoacid that can reversibly alter pH over two units. we demonstrated a strong bacterial inhibition assisted by visible light. The pH value of the solution reverts back to the original level immediately after the irradiation is stopped. If a photoacid is combined with colistin. the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin on multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be improved ∼32 times (from 8 to 0.25 μg mL−1). which significantly decreases the toxicity of colistin in clinics.

The conventional MED system uses hot water as the heat source by recuperating the waste heat from the sCO2 cycle. The MED-MVC system uses a vapor compressor to eliminate the need to condense the water vapor in the last effect of the MED system. The advantage of the MED-MVC is the ability to recuperate part of the waste heat of the sCO2 cycle through preheating the seawater feed directed to the first effect. Forward feed configuration is selected since high feed temperature can be accommodated for the MED-MVC.

By using higher porosity aluminum foam. the steady-state temperature was reached faster as compared to the foams with lower porosity. Similarly for the bigger pore size foams the steady state was attained faster as compared to the smaller pore size foams.

Different design parameters have been investigated such as foam properties (porosity. pore size. and thermal conductivity). heat sink shape. orientation. and use of internal fins inside the foam-PCM composite.

Enhancement techniques can be divided into two categories: passive and active. Active methods require external power. such as electric or acoustic field. mechanical devices. or surface vibration. whereas passive methods do not require external power but make use of a special surface geometry or fluid additive which cause heat transfer enhancement. The majority of commercially interesting enhancement techniques are passive ones.

New scaling parameters that characterize the performance of the adsorption cooling bed are derived and their importance are discussed. In addition. a numerical study is performed to illustrate the roles played by the newly derived scaling parameters. It is found that the presence of heat of adsorption makes the apparent heat capacity of an adsorption bed much larger than the heat capacity of the adsorbent material itself. The present results indicate that the heat diffusion and vapor penetration depths can be used to specify the desired working pair properties and the adsorbent layer thickness for producing the maximum cooling power. From the results of scaling analysis. it can be concluded that the inter-particle permeation resistance has a considerable effect on the performance of an adsorption silica gel …,True,hvwZFwYAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S129007291732224X,6849600188839162642,/scholar?cites=6849600188839162642,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S129007291732224X,0,0,0

During combustion. part of the Nitrogen fuel will be released as a component of the volatile matter compounds and as volatile nitrogen. while part will remain in the char. Thus. the fate of volatile-N and char-N becomes crucial for the formation of NOx and. consequently. for determining the concentrations of NO in solid fuels combustion systems. In pulverized fuel combustion. major routes for conversion of the volatile-N are either NO or N2. while char-N reacts through a set of heterogeneous reactions as the char is oxidized.

In order for carbon dioxide emitted from electricity generation and other industrial processes to be stored. it needs to have high purity. as impurities in the outlet stream can lead to difficulties in compression. transportation and sequestration (or utilisation) phases. The most common method is post‐-combustion capture. which burns the biomass fuel in a more or less conventional manner and then uses a separation process to remove the biogenic CO2 from the other components in the flue gases. Air firing of biomass coupled with post‐combustion capture requires minimal modifications to the base power plant. with the capture plant retrofittable; thus. existing plants may already be capture ready. CO2 separation from the flue gas can be achieved with various methods. as explored in Section 3.2. Oxy‐fuel combustion. the focus of Section 3.3. can also be retrofitted to some existing boilers as well as be applied to newly built power stations units. Due to the possibility of retrofits. both of these technologies have the potential to address future CO2 emissions that are already locked into existing fossil fuel plants (Florin and Fennell. 2010). The primary focus of carbon capture research has largely been on decarbonising energy generation based on fossil fuels (mainly coal). and consequently. thus far. only limited work has been conducted on the assessment of coupling or integrating biomass firing with carbon capture and storage (CCS).

The objective of the study was to determine the effect of Scenedesmus microalgae biomass on the comprehensive combustion characteristics (CCC) of the ultra-fines. The composites were designed with Design Expert and. unlike blending with the dry microalgae biomass. fresh slurry was blended with the ultra-fine coal and charcoal. Non-isothermal combustion was carried out at heating rate of 15 C/min at 40-900 C and flow rate of 20 ml/min. oxygen/carbon dioxide (O2/CO2) air. Combustion properties of composites were determined from thermogravimetric-differential thermogravimetric analysis and analysed using multiple regression.

While the phasing out of coal as a fuel is an important aspect of the `decarbonising' the electricity sector. the respective power plant technology could still play an important role into the future by use of abundant sources of solid biomass fuels. If such resources are to be effectively utilised. it is then necessary to accommodate the wide variation in the characteristics and behaviour of biomass fuels.

Two distinct methods are used to estimate the composition of the biomass fuels based on their ultimate and proximate analysis.

One of the major concerns about biomass utilization is the remarkable variety of its composition in terms of both organic and inorganic matrices. affecting the pyrolysis characteristic temperatures and products yield. The effect of different alkali and earth alkali metals (AAEMs) on biomass and cellulose pyrolysis has been extensively studied. whereas only few works exist concerning the effect of AAEMs on the pyrolysis of the other two main biomass components. namely hemicellulose and lignin.

The coal modelling framework previously developed for the simulation of combustion in large-scale facilities is extended for biomass capabilities. An iterative procedure is used to obtain devolatilization kinetics of coal and biomass for the test-case specific fuels and heating conditions. This is achieved by calibrating the model constants of two empirical models: the single first-order model and the distributed activation energy model. The reference data for calibration are devolatilization yields obtained with predictive coal and biomass multistep kinetic mechanisms. The variation of both particle density and diameter during char combustion is governed by the conversion mode. which is modelled using two approaches: the power law using a constant parameter that assumes a constant mode during char combustion and a constant-free model that considers a variable mode during combustion. Three numerical cases are considered: single first-order reaction with constant char combustion mode. distributed activation energy with constant char combustion mode. and single first-order reaction with variable char combustion mode. The numerical predictions from the large eddy simulations are compared with experimental results of a high co-firing rate large-scale laboratory flame of coal and biomass.

The DNS is designed such that it resolves the flame and all turbulent scales. but reverts to a point-particle description to avoid the resolution of individual particle boundary layers. The biomass particles are seeded in an air stream and mix with hot products from a second stream. The particles are heated up as they mix with the hot gases in the developing turbulent mixing layer. This is followed by devolatilization and volatile combustion. The volatile gas composition is modeled based on the composition and properties of the biomass particles. The gas phase is described by a reduced mechanism with 59 species and 462 reactions derived from the CRECK primary reference fuel and biomass mechanisms. The simulations are performed with the in-house LES/DNS code PsiPhi. coupled to Cantera to evaluate gas phase kinetics. The data is analyzed in terms of instantaneous contour plots of relevant quantities as well as spatially averaged statistics. The results are compared to a case of coal burning in the identical mixing layer setup such that differences and similarities between the ignition and burning behavior of biomass and coal can be analyzed. Both cases feature only small amounts of char conversion. hence the focus lies on volatile combustion.

Small particles (75–90 μm) of a high-volatile bituminous coal (PSOC-1451) and a lignite coal (DECS-11) are analyzed with particular attention to the particle burnout times and the particle surface temperatures. These experimental measurements are compared with the predictions of a comprehensive model of coal combustion. Combustion of coal particles is a multi-scale process where both chemical and physical phenomena are involved. thus it requires a coupled and accurate description of the kinetics as well as of the heat and mass transport phenomena.

In this work a relatively simple but flexible kinetic model is used to predict the thermal degradation of different coals in a wide range of operating conditions. The main feature of the model lies in its predictive capability: the elemental composition of the starting coal and the operating conditions are the only information required. Three reference coals are used to characterize the devolatilization process. The pyrolysis of each reference coal is described with a multi-step kinetic mechanism effective both at high and low heating rates. The devolatilization of the actual coal is simply obtained as a linear combination of the thermal degradation of the reference coals.

1185948,Kinetic model of coal combustion,2013,TIZIANO MAFFEI,,,,,Italy,in italiano Il carbone è un’importante risorsa energetica mondiale. grazie alla sua ampia distribuzione. alla sua disponibilità. ed ai bassi costi. Sfortunatamente. il carbone è una sorgente a forte impatto ambientale. non solo a causa delle emissioni di CO2 ma anche a causa dell’importanti emissione di ossidi di azoto e di zolfo. Per queste ragioni. si stanno sviluppando e affinando nuove tecnologie in grado di ridurre il suo impatto ambientale. Tra queste. la più promettente è l’ossi-combustione: l’aria è sostituita da una miscela di O2 and CO2 e di conseguenza numerose proprietà gassose cambiano. come la densità. la diffusività. l’emissività. influenzando la reattività del carbone. La combustione del carbone è un processo multi-fase. multi-scale e multi-componente che coinvolge molti composti (gas. liquidi. solidi). diversi aspetti cinetici (devolatilizzazione. reazioni eterogenee. reazioni secondarie in fase gas) cosi come fenomeni di trasporto sia alla scala della particella sia alla scala del reattore. Diverse caratteristiche della combustione del carbone sono stati analizzati in questo lavoro. con particolare attenzione agli aspetti cinetici di pirolisi e di ossidazione. Durante la combustione del carbone i più importanti termini sorgenti di SOx e NOx sono i cosiddetti “fuel mechanism”.

1185952,A Computational Framework for the Simulation of Gas-Solid Catalytic Reactors Based on a Multiregion Approach,2015,Tiziano Maffei and Giancarlo Gentile and Stefano Rebughini and Alberto Cuoci and Matteo Maestri,,,,,,Catalysts are functional materials or molecules able to provide ‘active sites’ which allow for a stabilization of the Gibbs free energy of the transition states of the elementary reactions. thus resulting in an enhanced reaction rate. In gas-solid heterogeneous catalytic reactions. such active sites are. by nature. present in a separate solid phase. which is embedded in a gas phase of reacting species. Therefore. the reactants present in the gas-phase have to reach the active sites and this involves several physical transport processes. All these steps occur at a finite rate and thus concentration (and temperature) gradients may arise between the bulk fluid phase conditions and the ones in proximity of the active site. As a consequence. the physical steps may have a strong impact on the rate of the overall process and thus the observable reaction rate may differ substantially from the intrinsic reaction rate of the chemical transformation under bulk fluid phase conditions. Such interplay between chemistry and transport processes determines the macroscopic observed functionality of the catalyst. which is an intrinsic multiscale property of the system. Indeed. it involves phenomena. which are characterized by very different time and length scales. A detailed description of the interactions between the catalytic chemistry and the transport processes is a requirement in order to obtain a rigorous understanding of the observed functionality of the catalyst material1.

This general mathematical model deals with the complex multiphase gas¬solid problem of biomass gasification both at the reactor and the particle scale. Mass and energy balances plus proper closure equations describe the behavior of both the phases. Key elements of the model are the detailed kinetic schemes describing the biomass volatilization. including the formation of TAR species and char. and the secondary gas phase as well as the heterogeneous reactions. The model has been already tested and validated on semi¬quantitative basis in comparisons with a 12 MW biomass combustor operating in Belgium.

The comparison with experimental data highlights the role of devolatilization. mass transfer phenomena. and mainly the kinetics of char gasification in controlling system's reactivity and syngas composition. An alternative configuration for biomass gasification is also presented and discussed. It is based on three different steps. including biomass pyrolysis through the convective heating of a syngas recycle stream. followed by the oxidation of volatile products (gas and tar compounds) with an air/steam mixture and a final char gasification.

This is due to the fibrous and tenacious nature of biomass. Torrefaction of biomass makes it brittle. as it diminishes its fibrous nature and. hence. it enhances its grindability.

This year’s manuscript will investigate whether there are possibilities of taking advantage of such very different combustion behaviors to curtail emissions of pollutants from burning blended fuels.

On the other hand. given that the nitrogen contents of coals vary narrowly. this work also explored whether co-firing of coals can influence the fuel-bound nitrogen evolution mechanism to disfavor formation of nitrogen oxides. This study included high-sulfur bituminous coals (such as Illinois# 6) and low-sulfur lignite coals (such as Beulah). Both of these coals have comparable nitrogen contents.

NOx. and CO2 gases from the combustion of pulverized coals. raw and torrefied biomasses. and 50-50 wt% blends thereof. The fuel samples chosen for this work are a high-sulfur bituminous coal (Illinois# 6). a low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal (Powder River Basin). a herbaceous biomass (corn straw) and a crop-related biomass (rice husk). All fuel samples were burned in a laboratory-scale electrically-heated drop-tube furnace (DTF). operated at 1400 K. and combustion emissions were measured in the furnace effluent. Coal and biomass particles were in the ranges of 75-90 µm and 90-150 µm. respectively.

The grids are compared in their 2006 configuration with the addition of coal-based CO 2 capture retrofits and emissions penalties from 0 to 100 US dollars per metric ton of CO 2 (USD/tCO 2). CO 2 capture flexibility is investigated by comparing inflexible CO 2 capture systems to flexible ones that can choose between full-and zero-load CO 2 capture depending on which operating mode has lower costs or higher profits. Comparing these two grids is interesting because they have similar installed capacity and peak demand. and both are isolated electricity systems with competitive wholesale electricity markets.

In this context. the potential to retrofit carbon dioxide (CO2) capture to existing power plants so that they can continue to operate in plausible future scenarios where significant cuts in CO2 emissions are required from the electricity sector has become an increasingly ‘hot topic’. One potentially important characteristic of retrofitted plants that is typically over-looked in assessments of CO2 capture retrofit is that they are likely to have ‘built-in flexibility’. For example. for plants that retrofit post-combustion capture without any significant changes to the power cycle (i.e. that do not undertake a boiler/turbine retrofit at the time as adding capture). it should be technically feasible for the plant to avoid the …,True,vp6W9u0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,31,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211003559,4107701768605474129,/scholar?cites=4107701768605474129,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610211003559/pdf?md5=d854578805a74e8c8fa1480163a57067&pid=1-s2.0-S1876610211003559-main.pdf,0,0,0

This has obvious implications for the operation of CCS power plants in decarbonised electricity systems with inflexible nuclear and variable renewable supply. The low variable costs of nuclear and some intermittent renewable technology allow them to run as base-load generators and shift fossil fuel plants from base-load to mid- merit plants. CCS power plants can be expected to increasingly operate in ways to balance variations. sometimes simultaneously. in the production of some intermittent renewable technologies and variations in electricity demand. resulting in more frequent ramping and start/stop cycles.

In parallel. it has also been suggested that flexible operation of power plants with CO2 capture could be important in at least some jurisdictions. It is likely that retrofitted power plants could have significant ‘built-in’ flexibility. but this potential is often not considered in studies of the economic performance of power plants with CO2 capture. This paper makes a contribution to filling this gap by developing methods for first order screening analysis of flexible operation of power plants with CO2 capture and applying them to the case study example of an appropriately integrated retrofit of post-combustion capture at a coal-fired power plant. The quantitative analysis suggests that rich solvent storage could be an attractive option on a short-run basis for some fuel.

1186008,Potential for synergy between renewables and carbon capture and storage,2006,Hannah Chalmers and Jon Gibbins,,29th IAEE International Conference,,,,In recent years. increasing concerns have been raised about global emissions of carbon dioxide which could lead to dangerous climate change. A significant proportion of these emissions have been generated by the burning of fossil fuels for electrical power generation and various methods have been proposed to reduce them. In many countries increased use of renewable energy. often including intermittent sources such as wind. has been strongly encouraged by policy makers. However. it is clear that they still require development and support. In addition. carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have now been identified as potentially feasible options to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions at fossil-fired power stations. This paper explores the potential for synergy between these families of technologies. In particular. it discusses the roles of different plant in the generation mix and suggests that the use of flexible plant. such as fossil-fired plants. could be key in allowing successful use of significant penetrations of intermittent technologies. It suggests various modes of flexible operation that could be possible for fossil-fired plant with carbon capture and presents an initial model to quantify the performance of capture plants. Suitable methods for further analysis are discussed. It is also important to realise that some renewable technologies are not intermittent and a portfolio of technologies must be developed. Thus. potential synergies and conflicts with these technologies should also be identified and the particular example of biomass co-firing at pulverised coal-fired plant is given.,True,vp6W9u0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,20,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.834&rep=rep1&type=pdf,8580012291996007950,/scholar?cites=8580012291996007950,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.834&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Several options for future CO2 capture from NGCC units can be envisaged including post-combustion capture technology using flue gas scrubbing with aqueous solvents. When an NGCC plant is designed to be ready for a retrofit with post-combustion capture. one of the most important technical considerations is the steam extraction pressure and flow to provide the energy necessary for solvent regeneration. This is determined by the choice of solvent used. but new solvents are being developed and the exact future requirements. in perhaps 10–20 years time. cannot be predicted.

In the near wall region or in regions where the grid resolution is not sufficiently fine to resolve smaller structures. the two-equation RANS shear-stress transport (SST) model is used. In the other regions with higher grid resolution an LES model is applied. First. the numerical requirements associated with the hybrid URANS/LES and the employed solver are studied in detail.

It provides the probability of autoignition and distinct criteria to determine the mean knock onset as well as the relative number of knocking cycles. For modeling purposes an ignition progress variable is proposed to determine the reactive state of the unburnt fuel–air mixture and the occurrence of autoignition.

The method uses a lifetime analysis of the chemical species which can be set to steady state according to a ranking procedure. Steady-state species concentrations are computed by algebraic rather than differential equations. thus yielding a significant reduction in the computational effort. In contrast to previous reduction schemes in which chemical species were selected only when they were in steady state throughout the whole process. the present method allows for species to be selected at each operating point separately generating an adaptive chemical kinetics scheme.

Household food wastes were utilized as raw material for the production of ethanol at high dry material consistencies. A distinct liquefaction/saccharification step has been included to the process. which rapidly reduced the viscosity of the high solid content substrate. resulting in better mixing of the fermenting microorganism. This step had a positive effect in both ethanol production and productivity. leading to a significant increase in both values. which was up to 40.81% and 4.46 fold. respectively. Remaining solids (residue) after fermentation at 45% w/v dry material (which contained also the unhydrolyzed fraction of cellulose). were subjected to a hydrothermal pretreatment in order to be utilized as raw material for a subsequent ethanol fermentation.

1186040,A novel hybrid organosolv: steam explosion method for the efficient fractionation and pretreatment of birch biomass,2018,Leonidas Matsakas and Christos Nitsos and Vijayendran Raghavendran and Olga Yakimenko and Gustav Persson and Eva Olsson and Ulrika Rova and Lisbeth Olsson and Paul Christakopoulos,11,Biotechnology for biofuels,1,1-14,BioMed Central,The main role of pretreatment is to reduce the natural biomass recalcitrance and thus enhance saccharification yield. A further prerequisite for efficient utilization of all biomass components is their efficient fractionation into well-defined process streams. Currently available pretreatment methods only partially fulfill these criteria. Steam explosion. for example. excels as a pretreatment method but has limited potential for fractionation. whereas organosolv is excellent for delignification but offers poor biomass deconstruction. In this article. a hybrid method combining the cooking and fractionation of conventional organosolv pretreatment with the implementation of an explosive discharge of the cooking mixture at the end of pretreatment was developed. The effects of various pretreatment parameters (ethanol content. duration. and addition of sulfuric acid) were evaluated. Pretreatment of birch at 200 °C with 60% v/v ethanol and 1% w/wbiomass H2SO4 was proven to be the most efficient pretreatment condition yielding pretreated solids with 77.9% w/w cellulose. 8.9% w/w hemicellulose. and 7.0 w/w lignin content. Under these conditions. high delignification of 86.2% was demonstrated. The recovered lignin was of high purity. with cellulose and hemicellulose contents not exceeding 0.31 and 3.25% w/w. respectively. and ash to be < 0.17% w/w in all cases. making it suitable for various applications. The pretreated solids presented high saccharification yields. reaching 68% at low enzyme load (6 FPU/g) and complete saccharification at high enzyme load (22.5 FPU/g).

At the same time. the increasing production of food waste is an important environmental issue. For this reason. production of ethanol from food waste is an interesting approach. Volumes of food waste are reduced and ethanol production does not compete with food production. In this work. we evaluated the possibility of using source-separated household food waste for the production of ethanol. To minimize the cost of ethanol production. the hydrolytic enzymes that are necessary for cellulose hydrolysis were produced in-house using the thermophillic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila. At the initial stage of the study. production of these thermophilic enzymes was studied and optimized. resulting in an activity of 0.28 FPU/mL in the extracellular broth. These enzymes were used to saccharify household food waste at a high dry material consistency of 30% w/w. followed by fermentation. Ethanol production reached 19.27 g/L with a volumetric productivity of 0.92 g/L· h. whereas only 5.98 g/L of ethanol was produced with a volumetric productivity of 0.28 g/L· h when no enzymatic saccharification was used.

Biodiesel is a potential substitute for petroleum. but its feasibility is hindered by the utilization of edible vegetable oil as raw material. which is responsible for a large fraction of the production cost and fosters the food versus fuel competition. Microbial oils are an interesting alternative as they do not compete with food production. and low cost renewable materials could serve as raw materials during cultivation of microorganisms. Sweet sorghum is an excellent candidate as substrate for microbial oil production. as it possesses high photosynthetic activity yielding high amounts of soluble and insoluble carbohydrates. and does not require high fertilization and irrigation rates. Initially the ability of sweet sorghum to fully support yeast growth. both as a carbon and nitrogen source was evaluated. It was found that addition of an external nitrogen source had a negative impact on single cell oil (SCO) production yields. which has a positive effect on the process economics. Subsequently the effect of the presence of a distinct saccharification step on SCO was examined. The presence of an enzymatic saccharification step prior to SCO production improved the production of SCO. especially in high solid concentrations. Removal of solids was also investigated and its positive effect on SCO production was also demonstrated. When juice from 20% w/w enzymatically liquefied sweet sorghum was used as the raw material.

Rhodosporidium sp. and Lipomyces sp. are good candidates for SCO production. Lipid extractability differs according to yeast species and literature on the most suitable method for each oleaginous yeast species is scarce. This work aimed to investigate the efficiency of the most cited strategies for extracting lipids from intact and pretreated cells of Rhodosporidium toruloides and Lipomyces starkeyi. Lipid extractions were conducted using hexane or combinations of chloroform and methanol. The Folch method resulted in the highest lipid yields for both yeasts (42% for R. toruloides and 48% for L. starkeyi). Also. this method eliminates the cell pretreatment step. The Bligh and Dyer method underestimated the lipid content in the tested strains (25% for R. toruloides and 34% for L. starkeyi). Lipid extractability increased after acid pretreatment for the Pedersen. hexane. and Bligh and Dyer methods. For R. toruloides unexpected fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) composition were found for some lipid extraction strategies tested. Therefore. this work provides useful information for analytical and process development aiming at biodiesel production from the SCO of these two yeast species.

In petroleum biorefineries. the microbial biomass has become a sustainable source of renewable biofuels. Biodiesel is mainly produced from oils obtained from oleaginous microorganisms involving various upstream and downstream processes. such as cultivation. harvesting. lipid extraction. and transesterification. Among them. lipid extraction is a crucial step for the process and it represents an important bottleneck for the commercial scale production of biodiesel. Lipids are synthesized in the cellular compartment of oleaginous microorganisms in the form of lipid droplets. so it is necessary to disrupt the cells prior to lipid extraction in order to improve the extraction yields. Various mechanical. chemical and physicochemical pretreatment methods are employed to disintegrate the cellular membrane of oleaginous microorganisms. The objective of the present review article is to evaluate the various pretreatment methods for efficient lipid extraction from the oleaginous cellular biomass available to date. as well as to discuss their advantages and disadvantages. including their effect on the lipid yield.

Conversion of lignin to nanoparticles is an attractive solution. Here. we investigated the effect of different lignin isolation processes and a post-treatment homogenization step on particle formation. Lignin was isolated from birch chips by using two organosolv processes. traditional organosolv (OS) and hybrid organosolv-steam explosion (HOS-SE) at various ethanol contents. For post-treatment. lignin was homogenized at 500 bar using different ethanol: water ratios. Isolation of lignin with OS resulted in unshaped lignin particles. whereas after HOS-SE. lignin micro-particles were formed directly. Addition of an acidic catalyst during HOS-SE had a negative impact on the particle formation. and the optimal ethanol content was 50–60% v/v. Homogenization had a positive effect as it transformed initially unshaped lignin into spherical nanoparticles and reduced the size of the micro-particles isolated by HOS-SE. Ethanol content during homogenization affected the size of the particles. with the optimal results obtained at 75% v/v.

1186055,Biological production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid: an update on the current status,2018,Leonidas Matsakas and Kateřina Hrůzová and Ulrika Rova and Paul Christakopoulos,4,,1,13,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The production of high added-value chemicals from renewable resources is a necessity in our attempts to switch to a more sustainable society. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a promising molecule that can be used for the production of an important array of high added-value chemicals. such as 1. 3-propanediol. acrylic acid. acrylamide. and bioplastics. Biological production of 3HP has been studied extensively. mainly from glycerol and glucose. which are both renewable resources. To enable conversion of these carbon sources to 3HP. extensive work has been performed to identify appropriate biochemical pathways and the enzymes that are involved in them. Novel enzymes have also been identified and expressed in host microorganisms to improve the production yields of 3HP. Various process configurations have also been proposed. resulting in improved conversion yields. The intense research efforts have resulted in the production of as much as 83.8 g/L 3HP from renewable carbon resources. and a system whereby 3-hydroxypropionitrile was converted to 3HP through whole-cell catalysis which resulted in 184.7 g/L 3HP. Although there are still challenges and difficulties that need to be addressed. the research results from the past four years have been an important step towards biological production of 3HP at the industrial level.

Feedstock pretreatment in a simple. cost effective. agnostic manner is a major challenge. Methods: In this work. beechwood sawdust was delignified via an organosolv process. assisted by homogeneous inorganic acid catalysis. Mixtures of water and several organic solvents were evaluated for their performance. Specifically. ethanol (EtOH). acetone (AC). and methyl-isobutyl-ketone (MIBK) were tested with or without the use of homogeneous acid catalysis employing sulfuric. phosphoric. and oxalic acids under relatively mild temperature of 175 C for one hour. Results: Delignification degrees (DD) higher than 90% were achieved. where both AC and EtOH proved to be suitable solvents for this process. Both oxalic and especially phosphoric acid proved to be good alternative catalysts for replacing sulfuric acid. High gravity simultaneous saccharification and fermentation with an enzyme loading of 8.4 mg/g solids at 20 wt.% initial solids content reached an ethanol yield of 8.0 w/v%. Conclusions: Efficient delignification combining common volatile solvents and mild acid catalysis allowed for the production of ethanol at high concentration in an efficient manner.

Under this view. various types of biomass might require a minimal set of enzymes that has to be tailor-made. Partially defined complex mixtures that are currently commercially used are not adapted to efficiently degrade different materials. so novel enzyme mixtures have to be customized. Development of these cocktails requires better knowledge about the specific activities involved. in order to optimize hydrolysis. The role of filamentous fungus Myceliophthora thermophila and its complete enzymatic repertoire for the bioconversion of complex carbohydrates has been widely proven. In this study. four core cellulases (MtCBH7. MtCBH6. MtEG5 and MtEG7). in the presence of other four “accessory” enzymes (mannanase. lytic polyssacharide monooxygenase MtGH61. xylanase.

Synergistic interactions among different enzymes were determined using a suitable design of experiments methodology.

The effects of different lignin types on the rheological. thermal. and tribological properties of the lignin/EG lubricants were comprehensively investigated by various characterization techniques. Dissolving organosolv lignin in EG results in outstanding lubricating properties. Specifically. the wear volume of the disc by EG-44BL is only 8.9% of that lubricated by pure EG. The enhanced anti-wear property of the EG/lignin system could be attributed to the formation of a robust lubrication film and the strong adhesion of the lubricant on the contacting metal surface due to the presence of a dense hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) network. The lubricating performance of EG-BL outperforms EG-SL. which could be attributed to the denser H-bonding sites in BL and its broader molecular weight distribution. The disc wear loss of EG-44BL is only 45.7% of that lubricated by EG-44SL. Overall. H-bonding is the major contributor to the different tribological properties of BL and SL in EG-based lubricants.

Model predictions and experimental measurements are discussed and compared across a wide range of operating conditions. This study moves from the detailed analysis of species profiles in syngas oxidation in flow reactor and laminar premixed flames to global combustion properties (ignition delay times and laminar flame speeds) by referring to a large set of literature data.

1186113,The nature of stable char radicals: An ESR and DFT study of structural and hydrogen bonding requirements,2018,Anna Trubetskaya and Morgens Larsen Andersen and Søren Talbro Barsberg,,,,,Wiley and Sons Ltd,Pyrolysis is a promising way to convert biomass into fuels and chemicals. This reaction is complex and inevitably involves a cascade of radical reactions that lead to char formation. in which some radicals become trapped and stabilized. Their nature is difficult to characterize. and in this respect computational chemistry can be a strong supplementary tool to electron spin resonance spectroscopy and other experimental methods. Here biomass char radicals and oxidation reactivity are studied experimentally. and density functional theory is used to predict the thermodynamic stability and g‐values of carbon‐ and oxygen‐centered radicals of polyaromatic char models including defect structures.

[2]. However. it needs to be very careful when applying the control strategy if inequality state constraints are active because handling the state constraints is one of the difficult issues in optimal control problems. In contrast to HEVs. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) possibly consume all of the available electric energy. and so the activation of the state constraint on minimum State of Charge (SOC) is. unfortunately. a very common control problem for PHEVs.

See also URL http://www. transportation. anl. gov/pdfs/HV/461. pdf,,1-18,,In this study. electric-drive vehicles with series powertrains were configured to utilize a lithiumion battery with very high power and achieve sport-sedan performance and excellent fuel economy. The battery electrode materials are LiMn2O4 and Li4Ti5O12. which provide a cell areaspecific impedance of about 40% of that of the commonly available lithium-ion batteries. Data provided by EnerDel Corp. for this system demonstrate this low impedance and also a long cycle life at 55oC. All the batteries for these vehicles were designed to deliver 100 kW of power at 90% open-circuit voltage to provide high battery efficiency (97–98%) during vehicle operation. This heats the battery by only 1.8oC per hour of travel on the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) cycle. which essentially eliminates the need for battery cooling. Three vehicles were designed. each with series powertrains and simulation test weights between 1.575 and 1.633 kg: a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with a 45-kg battery. a plug-in HEV (PHEV) 10 with a 60-kg battery. and a PHEV20 with a 100-kg battery. Vehicle simulation tests on Argonne National Laboratory’s simulation software. the Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT). which was developed with MATLAB/Simulink. showed that these vehicles could accelerate to 60 miles per hour in 6.2 to 6.3 seconds and achieve fuel economies of 50 to 54 miles per gallon on the UDDS and highway fuel economy test (HWFET) cycles.

IL (United States),The current international energy situation has brought about serious concerns in most of the developed countries about their use of fossil fuels and their need for developing renewable energy sources. This energy crisis takes place in the context of oil-stock reduction and a dramatic demand increase from developing countries. A study by M. Wang (2006) shows that Chinese on-road vehicles could consume up to 20.6 million bbl of oil per day by 2050. Moreover. China could face a tremendous increase in highway vehicles (including cars. trucks. and buses) in the next 40 years. Indeed. depending upon the case scenario developed in the study. there could be between 486 and 662 million highway vehicles in China in 2050. compared to roughly 27 million in 2004. Such a dramatic evolution could have severe impacts on climate change and on the oil market. The dilemma cannot be solved without creating new energy and/or transportation systems that either consume less oil or are not dependent on oil.With a consumption of almost 20 million bbl/day. the United States is by far the world’s highest-oil-consuming country (Central Intelligence Agency. 2008).

In order to develop the operating strategy of the dual-mode EVT. dynamic equations of the HEV powertrain including the EVT are obtained and the motor torque control algorithm is designed using inversion-based control. To evaluate the performance of the operating strategy. an HEV …,True,l1uOHa0AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,40,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1243/09544070JAUTO730,9119896620653996572,/scholar?cites=9119896620653996572,,,0,0,0

The Volt uses a series-split powertrain architecture. which provides benefits over the series architecture that typically has been considered for use in electric-range extended vehicles (EREVs). A specialized EREV powertrain. called the Voltec. drives the Volt through its entire range of speed and acceleration with battery power alone and within the limit of battery energy. thereby displacing more fuel with electricity than a PHEV. which characteristically blends electric and engine power together during driving.

FCETs use a battery combined with onboard hydrogen storage for energy storage. The additional battery provides regenerative braking and better fuel economy. but it will also increase the initial cost of the vehicle. Heavier reliance on stored hydrogen might be cheaper initially. but operational costs will be higher because hydrogen is more expensive than electricity. Achieving the right tradeoff between these power and energy choices is necessary to reduce the ownership cost of the vehicle. This paper develops an optimum component sizing algorithm for FCETs. The truck vehicle model was developed in Autonomie. a platform for modelling vehicle energy consumption and performance. The algorithm optimizes component sizes to minimize overall ownership cost. while ensuring that the FCET matches or exceeds the performance and cargo capacity of a conventional vehicle.

The dual mode power split system consists of an electric variator. MG1 and MG2. and three planetary gear sets. In order to develop the control algorithm for the best fuel economy. the dual mode PST is analyzed by network analysis.

In order to guarantee sufficient computational efficiency to meet future online requirements. the algorithm is based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. The whole driving/operation strategy is composed of a series of solutions to the optimal control sub-problem for each separate route segment. The control sequence computed offline is then evaluated in Autonomie. The simulation result shows6% fuel savings compared to a baseline rule-based controller with no speed optimization.,True,l1uOHa0AAAAJ:IsPWOBWtZBwC,7,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daliang-Shen/publication/320434258_Energy-Efficient_Cruise_Control_Using_Optimal_Control_for_a_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicle/links/59e525beaca272390ed6447e/Energy-Efficient-Cruise-Control-Using-Optimal-Control-for-a-Hybrid-Electric-Vehicle.pdf,10432729800895356320,/scholar?cites=10432729800895356320,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daliang-Shen/publication/320434258_Energy-Efficient_Cruise_Control_Using_Optimal_Control_for_a_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicle/links/59e525beaca272390ed6447e/Energy-Efficient-Cruise-Control-Using-Optimal-Control-for-a-Hybrid-Electric-Vehicle.pdf,0,0,0

1186197,Modeling the Transportation Energy Impact of Future Population Scenarios for the Detroit Region Using POLARIS and Autonomie,2018,Joshua Auld and Ehsan Islam and Thomas Stephens and Shon Driscoll and Mahmoud Javanmardi,,,18-05743,,,A transportation system model was developed for the Detroit area using the POLARIS-Autonomie agent-based transportation-energy simulator. Working with local stakeholders. the authors identified two future population growth and land-use change scenarios. They then applied the model to analyze mobility and energy implications of different growth patterns. The model was applied to simulate the Detroit areafor a baseline case and two future scenarios:--SEMCOG2040: a future based on business as usual projections--DFC2040: a future with significant land use changes and urban revitalization. For both scenarios. two cases with current and advanced (more efficient) vehicles were simulated. representing vehicle with fuel economies projected for the year 2040. Under the SEMCOG2040 scenario. slight increases in trips and VMT were seen over the baseline case. For the DFC2040 scenario. trips were reduced by 8% with a 9% decrease in VMT from the baseline case. due in part to increased transit use and walking. When vehicles were assumed to be advanced-technology (more efficient) vehicles. energy use was reduced by an additional 30%.

Particularly. we present a data-driven approach to vehicle price modeling and its component price estimation by leveraging a combination of concepts from machine learning and game theory. We show an alternative to common teardown methodologies and surveying approaches for component and vehicle price estimation at the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) level that has the advantage of bypassing the uncertainties involved in 1) the gathering of teardown data. 2) the need to perform expensive and biased surveying. and 3) the need to perform retail price equivalent (RPE) or indirect cost multiplier (ICM) adjustments to mark up direct manufacturing costs to MSRP. This novel exercise not only provides accurate pricing of the technologies at the customer level. but also shows the. a priori known. large gaps in pricing strategies between manufacturers. vehicle sizes. classes. market segments. and other factors. There is also clear synergism or interaction between the price of certain technologies and other specifications present in the same vehicle. Those (unsurprising) results are indication that old methods of manufacturer-level component costing. aggregation. and the application of a flat and rigid RPE or ICM adjustment factor should be carefully examined.

Argonne. IL (United States),In 1975. Congress passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). requiring standards for corporate average fuel economy (CAFE). and charging the US Department of Transportation (DOT) with the establishment and enforcement of these standards. The Secretary of Transportation has delegated these responsibilities to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).NHTSA has contracted the DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) to provide analytical support for NHTSA’s regulatory and analytical activities related to fuel economy standards. Unlike long-standing safety and criteria pollutant emissions standards. fuel economy standards apply to manufacturers’ overall fleets rather than to individual vehicle models. In developing the standards. NHTSA made use of the CAFE Compliance and Effects Modeling System (the “CAFE model”). which was developed by DOT’s Volpe Center for the 2005–2007 CAFE rulemaking and has been continually updated since. The model is the primary tool used by the agency to evaluate potential CAFE stringency levels by applying technologies incrementally to each manufacturer’s fleet until the requirements under consideration are met. The CAFE model relies on numerous technology-related and economic inputs such as market forecasts and technology cost and effectiveness estimates; these inputs are categorized by vehicle classification. technology synergies. phase-in rates. cost learning curve adjustments. and technology “decision trees.” The Volpe Center assists NHTSA in the development of the engineering and economic inputs to the CAFE model by …,True,upMdGrYAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1608044,,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1608044,0,0,0

Quick rise of battery temperature is not only important to mitigate lithium plating and thus preserve battery life. but also to increase the battery power limits so as to fully achieve fuel economy savings expected from a PHEV. Likewise. it is also important to raise the engine temperature so as to improve engine efficiency (therefore vehicle fuel economy) and to reduce emissions. One method of increasing the temperature of either component is to maximize their usage at cold temperatures thus increasing cumulative heat generating losses.

FCETs use a battery combined with onboard hydrogen storage for energy storage. The additional battery provides regenerative braking and better fuel economy. but it will also increase the initial cost of the vehicle. Heavier reliance on stored hydrogen might be cheaper initially. but operational costs will be higher because hydrogen is more expensive than electricity. Achieving the right tradeoff between these power and energy choices is necessary to reduce the ownership cost of the vehicle. This paper develops an optimum component sizing algorithm for FCETs. The truck vehicle model was developed in Autonomie. a platform for modelling vehicle energy consumption and performance. The algorithm optimizes component sizes to minimize overall ownership cost. while ensuring that the FCET matches or exceeds the performance and cargo capacity of a conventional vehicle.

In particular. we focus on two specific aspects of these problems: speed and structure. Even with the continuing decrease in cost of disk space and memory. it seems that there will always exist data sets that are just beyond the reach of modern computational techniques. In general. for these techniques to be applied to a large data set. we often desire some form of compression (compaction) of the original data. This compression reduces both the amount of physical drive space required to store data and the memory required in performing the computations that allow for exploration of the data. In performing this compression. we wish to maximize the speed of the actual compression as well as the speed of subsequent computations. Current techniques follow the strategies of rank reduction used in linear algebra and are founded on widespread research ([1].[10].[18].[22]. and [26]).However. in doing compression. these rank reduction techniques usually destroy any special structure of the original data array. In particular. current techniques fail to preserve the non-negativity of the data found in practice. Both the resulting basis and its accompanying coefficients (weights) lie outside of the original non-negative space of the data.

For this problem. recently an estimation-based local search algorithm using delta evaluation has been proposed. In this paper. we adopt two well-known variance reduction procedures in the estimation-based local search algorithm: the first is an adaptive sampling procedure that selects the appropriate size of the sample to be used in Monte Carlo evaluation; the second is a procedure that adopts importance sampling to reduce the variance involved in the cost estimation. We investigate several possible strategies for applying these procedures to the given problem and we identify the most effective one. Experimental results show that a particular heuristic customization of the two procedures increases significantly the effectiveness of the estimation-based local search.,True,ZycQHdgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221708009776,811806237682084903,/scholar?cites=811806237682084903,,https://iridia.ulb.ac.be/IridiaTrSeries/rev/IridiaTr2007-015r002.pdf,0,0,0

A process was developed to synthesize speed profiles through a combination of Markov chains and information from a geographical information system (GIS) about the future route. In a potential real-world scenario. the future trip (speed. grade. stops. etc.) can be estimated. but not deterministically known. The stochastic trip prediction process models such uncertainty.

1186318,Energy Consumption Prediction of a Vehicle along a User-Specified Real-World Trip,2012,Dominik Karbowski and Sylvain Pagerit and Andrew Calkins,,,,,,Standard cycles provide an easy way to evaluate the energy consumption of vehicles. but it is the energy consumption that occurs on real-world trips that really matters to the driver and. to a larger extent. society. This study shows how digital maps and vehicle simulation tools can be used to estimate energy consumption on a real-world trip. The user (1) selects a trip in the mapping service ADAS-RP (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems Research Platform).(2) defines a vehicle model in the vehicle powertrain simulation tool Autonomie. and (3) runs and analyzes the simulation in that same tool. For each section of the trip. ADAS-RP provides various information that can include speed limits. historic data on traffic pattern speeds. the slopes of the routes. and the positions of stop signs and traffic lights. The first stage of processing this information is to schedule the stops and to create an intermediate speed target that takes those stops into account. The final driver demand speed includes transitions–accelerations and decelerations–between sections with different intermediate speed targets. or around stops. The ADAS-RP/Autonomie process is then used to compute the energy consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle and a conventional vehicle on 10 trips defined across the United States and Germany. The hybrid vehicle is more fuel efficient. especially on congested routes and routes with downhill slopes. the effect of which is analyzed in further detail.,True,x9vC8JUAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,31,https://www.mdpi.com/2032-6653/5/4/1109,18426104186469341601,/scholar?cites=18426104186469341601,,https://www.mdpi.com/2032-6653/5/4/1109/pdf,0,0,0

This paper details our investigation into the method of using traffic information to predict the future driving cycle. as well as an examination of the optimal control strategy based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. in order to minimize fuel consumption on a given trip distance and to develop a real-time implementable control strategy. To predict future driving patterns. the Dynamic Programming theory is proposed for the calculation of vehicle speed with respect to driving distance. under the assumption that data about traffic conditions are obtained from external traffic information. such as Intelligent Transportation Systems. Prediction of future driving speed is achieved by minimizing the proposed cost function on each segment. The results of the generated speed profile can properly estimate the driving pattern of the driver. Also. a co-state generation algorithm is applied to determine the parameters with respect to the required power deduced from the predicted driving cycle. The proposed co-state generation model can find the estimated initial co-state that is similar to the optimal co-state.

1186325,Fuel efficient speed optimization for real-world highway cruising,2018,Daliang Shen and Dominik Karbowski and A Rosseau,1,Fuel,,0589,,This paper introduces an eco-driving highway cruising algorithm based on optimal control theory that is applied to a conventionallypowered connected and automated vehicle. Thanks to connectivity to the cloud and/or to infrastructure. speed limit and slope along the future route can be known with accuracy. This can in turn be used to compute the control variable trajectory that will minimize energy consumption without significantly impacting travel time. Automated driving is necessary to the implementation of this concept. because the chosen control variables (eg. torque and gear) impact vehicle speed. An optimal control problem is built up where quadratic models are used for the powertrain. The optimization is solved by applying Pontryagin’s minimum principle. which reduces the problem to the minimization of a cost function with parameters called co-states. The proposed algorithm assumes piecewise constant slopes and speed limits. and it solves the transition vehicle speeds for each junction of such segments. In addition. a method to extract route information from digital maps is presented. which complies with the proposed optimization algorithm. The algorithms are evaluated in simulation. using Autonomie. a simulation tool for vehicle energy consumption modeling. The optimal control trajectory (eg. torque. gear) is first computed offline. It is then applied in an open-loop fashion in online simulation. using a forward-looking model of the vehicle in Autonomie.

Gear shifting and coupling between the engine and the driveline are explicitly included in the optimal control problem. and this leads to a hybrid system.

The travel survey data is used to estimate both a standard multinomial destination choice model and a model where the choice set is constrained by what has already been planned in the schedule. The performance of each model is evaluated and the impact of using the planning-constrained model in place of the standard model on the accuracy of the results is evaluated. The use of a model where the destination choices are conditioned on what has been previously planned improves the accuracy of the model. This is true in terms of correctly predicted location choices and especially in terms of overall trip length distributions where more realistic distributions are observed when decisions are constrained.,True,4FpPXMIAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC,14,https://www.its.ucdavis.edu/files/general/pdf/2013-02-14_Auld-Mohammadian.pdf,7765610845922077745,/scholar?cites=7765610845922077745,,https://www.its.ucdavis.edu/files/general/pdf/2013-02-14_Auld-Mohammadian.pdf,0,0,0

The rule-based conflict resolution model was previously estimated by using the CHASE scheduling process data to represent the process that individuals undergo when a scheduling conflict occurs within their activity pattern. The updated scheduling rules can handle more conflict cases and allow for more realistic resolution types than the TASHA scheduler. The updated scheduler was compared with the scheduling rules in TASHA for validation by scheduling the planned CHASE activities through use of both schedulers. and the results were compared with the actual executed activity patterns.

Naturally. the various attributes of an activity—such as start time. duration. location. party involvement. and mode of travel—can be planned in different time horizons. An attribute that is planned affects the choice of other activity attributes.

Functionalized gold nanoparticles are aggregated in solution in the presence of divalent metal ions by an ion-templated chelation process; this causes an easily measurable change in the absorption spectrum of the particles. The aggregation also enhances the hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) response from the nanoparticle solutions. providing an inherently more sensitive method of detection. The chelation/aggregation process is reversible via addition of a strong metal ion chelator such as EDTA.

Commission of the European Communities,There is a general consensus that monetary stability in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) requires sustainable public finances of the member states. The idea that persistent fiscal laxity would undermine the European Central Bank’s ability to fulfil its mandate of price stability runs through all important documents and decisions marking the progress towards EMU. from the Delors Report in1989 to the fiscal convergence criteria for entry into EMU defined by the Maastricht Treaty. to the Stability and Growth Pact adopted in Amsterdam. Indeed. the EMU member states undertook strenuous efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation in the run-up to EMU. which allowed them to meet the deficit limit of 3% of GDP. and. in most countries. to reduce the level of public debt.The commitment to sustainable public finances and budgetary discipline continues in Stage III of EMU. as the member states must meet the obligations of the …,True,HSrgjU4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,368,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6617128.pdf,8007554476314804618,/scholar?cites=8007554476314804618,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6617128.pdf,0,0,0

Empirical evidence on creative accounting with fiscal rules in the EU,2006,Jürgen Von Hagen and Guntram B Wolff,30,Journal of Banking & Finance,12,3259-3279,North-Holland,Fiscal rules. such as the excessive deficit procedure and the stability and growth pact (SGP). aim at constraining government behavior. [Milesi-Ferretti. G.. 2003. Good. bad or ugly? On the effects of fiscal rules with creative accounting. Journal of Public Economics. 88. 377–394] develops a model in which governments circumvent such rules by reverting to creative accounting. The amount of this depends on the reputation cost for the government and the economic cost of sticking to the rule. We provide empirical evidence of creative accounting in the European Union. We find that the SGP rules have induced governments to use stock-flow adjustments. a form of creative accounting. to hide deficits. The tendency to substitute stock-flow adjustments for budget deficits is especially strong for the cyclical component of the deficit. as in times of recession the cost of reducing the deficit is particularly large.,True,HSrgjU4AAAAJ:jgBuDB5drN8C,333,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037842660600118X,14254198752553749561,/scholar?cites=14254198752553749561,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/93748/1/sfb-tr15-dp148.pdf,0,0,0
1186886,Fiscal rules. fiscal institutions. and fiscal performance,2002,Jurgen Von Hagen,,"Vol. XX, No. XX, Issue, Year",,,Economic & Social Research Institute,Public spending is a story of some people spending other people’s money. In modern democracies. voters elect politicians to make decisions about public spending for them. and they provide the funds by paying taxes. Two aspects of this story are worrying and have received considerable academic interest in recent years. The first is that public spending involves delegation. and. hence. principal-agent relationships. Elected politicians can extract rents from being in office. ie. use some of the funds entrusted to them to pursue their own interests. be it outright in corruption. for perks. or simply waste. Voters might wish to eliminate the opportunity to extract rents by subjecting politicians to rules stipulating what they can and must do under given conditions. But the need to react to unforeseen developments and the complexity of the situation makes the writing of such contracts impossible. For the same reasons. politicians cannot realistically commit fully to promises made during election campaigns. Hence. like principal-agent relations in many other settings. the voter-politician relationship resembles an “incomplete contract”(Seabright. 1996; Persson et al.. 1997a. b; Tabellini. 2000).,True,HSrgjU4AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,284,https://www.esr.ie/ESR_papers/vol33_3/Vol33_3vonHagen.pdf,14535748899126464542,/scholar?cites=14535748899126464542,,https://www.esr.ie/ESR_papers/vol33_3/Vol33_3vonHagen.pdf,0,0,0

The study finds. first. that bond yield spreads during the crisis can largely be explained on the basis of the same variables as before the crisis. Second. markets penalise fiscal imbalances much more strongly after the Lehman default in September 2008 than before. There is also a significant increase in the spread on non-benchmark bonds due to higher general risk aversion. and German bonds obtained a safe-haven investment status similar to that of the US which they did not have before the crisis.

We define banking crises as periods in which there is excessive demand for liquidity in the money market. We begin with the theoretical foundation of this new method. With the newly defined crisis episodes. we examine the determinants of banking crises using data complied from 47 countries.

We study the performance of such a system using historical data. A reasonable insurance scheme can be implemented on the basis of a fairly complex econometric formula. Simplifying the computation of the transfers severely worsens the performance of the system. Forcing the system to balance financially is not a critical constraint.

1186894,Stability and growth in Europe: towards a better pact,2003,Antonio Fatás and Jürgen Von Hagen and Jurgen von Hagen and Andrew Hughes Hallett and Anne Sibert and Rolf Strauch,13,,,,Centre for Economic Policy Research,The fiscal policy framework of the EMU is in a states of crisis. Since the start of EMU. fiscal conditions in some member states have slipped considerably beyond the limits set by the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. It is clear that the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact has failed to preclude excessive deficits. There is no shortage of proposals to reform the current fiscal framework in this crisis situation. They range from calls for softening their implementation. and to proposals for closer coordination of national fiscal policies. None of these proposals offers a convincing solution to the problem at the heart of the current crisis: how to balance the need for effective long-run fiscal stability in EMU with the need for short-run flexibility of fiscal policy in the member states. After a detailed analysis of the virtues and defects of the current fiscal framework. this report presents a proposal for reform that addresses this issue. The authors argue that EMU should move away from rigid fiscal rules for annual deficits towards a more judgmental process of monitoring the sustainability of fiscal policies. This approach is guided by three principles: independence. transparency. and legitimacy. Together wit the ability to assess the fiscal situation and outlook of each euro-area member state. they are the keys to designing a framework that provides enough flexibility and. at the same time. can build the required credibility and political support. The authors propose the creation of a Sustainability Council for the EMU. and independent body with the sole statutory task of safeguarding the sustainability of public finances in the euro area.

1186895,Current account imbalances and financial integration in the euro area,2011,Birgit Schmitz and Jürgen Von Hagen,30,Journal of International Money and Finance,8,1676-1695,Pergamon,While the current account of the euro area as a whole has remained almost balanced in the past two decades. several member countries have sizeable deficits or surpluses. In this paper. we interpret these imbalances as indicators of net capital flows among the euro-area countries. We distinguish between balances against the euro zone and the rest of the world and examine these for the EU-15 countries. We find that for euro members the net flows follow differences in per-capita incomes. even before the introduction of the euro. Our results show further that with the introduction of the common currency the elasticity with respect to per-capita incomes of net capital flows within the euro area has increased for the members of the euro zone. This increase can neither be observed for the flows between the euro members and the rest of the world nor for the flows between the countries that stayed outside the monetary …,True,HSrgjU4AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,200,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560611001276,15325929210877352396,/scholar?cites=15325929210877352396,,https://repec.cepr.org/repec/cpr/ceprdp/DP7262.pdf,0,0,0

In contrast to previous work in this area. we do not arbitrarily predefine a measure of persistence to evaluate consolidation “success.” By employing duration analysis techniques. the length of a consolidation spell is rather determined endogenously. Our results based on a sample of industrialised OECD countries show that “consolidation fatigue” and the quality of fiscal consolidations are indeed important determinants of their longevity. Moreover. high debt–GDP ratio and fiscal tightening in other OECD countries raise the likelihood of consolidations to persist. Applying our results to European countries in the 1990s provides only weak evidence suggesting that the Maastricht process contributed much to the fiscal consolidations observed in Europe during the 1990s …,True,HSrgjU4AAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,199,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889158302905162,15226271513362482605,/scholar?cites=15226271513362482605,,,0,0,0
1186897,A European mechanism for sovereign debt crisis resolution: a proposal,2010,Francois Gianviti and Anne O Krueger and Jean Pisani-Ferry and André Sapir and Jürgen Von Hagen,9,,,,Bruegel,The sovereign debt crisis in the euro area during the spring of 2010 has revealed that the monetary and fiscal policy framework of the European Monetary Union (EMU) is still incomplete. Obviously. the rules-based framework for fiscal policy created by the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact was insufficient to prevent a debt crisis despite its emphasis on keeping public sector deficits low and strengthening forward-looking budgetary planning. Moreover. once the crisis occurred and financial markets were agitated by it. it became obvious that EMU did not have policy tools to manage and resolve the crisis. In the end. the European Union responded to the crisis first by agreeing on stabilisation for Greece and then by creating the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) that succeeded in calming the markets. However. these responses were developed in an ad-hoc manner and on a temporary basis only and do not provide a sufficient basis for dealing with any possible future debt crises in the euro area.Several proposals have been put forward for how to improve the euro area’s capacity to deal with problems of excessive public debts. In order to prevent sovereign crises. the European Commission (2010) has proposed a number of measures to strengthen the Excessive Deficit Procedure and the Stability and Growth Pact. These proposals focus mainly on making the rules of the current framework more effective and on strengthening their enforcement by introducing stiffer and more automatic penalties for violating these rules.

The coal use is the major source of the greenhouse gas CO2 and particles causing serious health damage. This paper looks into the question if coal washing might work as low cost strategy for both CO2 and particle emission reductions. Coal washing removes dirt and rock from raw coal. resulting in a coal product with higher thermal energy and less air pollutants. Coal cleaning capacity has so far not been developed in line with the market potential. In this paper an emerging market for cleaned coal is studied within a CGE model for China. The macro approach catches the repercussions of coal cleaning through increased energy efficiency. lower coal transportation costs and crowding out effect of investments in coal washing plants.

Previous studies have extensively focused on only part of the global economy to study rebound effects. e.g. energy consumption by households. one industry. or one country. However. since the global economy is highly connected among countries. these studies may lead to misleading conclusions if the rebound effects in the rest of the economy are significant.

GRACE_adapt has been developed for the ADAM project to address economic impacts of climate change and resulting adaptation. interpreted as the economic responses to climate impacts. The development of the integrated computable general equilibrium model GRACE_adapt represents an attempt to bring consistency between adaptation to climate change and economic behaviour. The model is based on the idea that adaptation to climate change can be interpreted within the context of economic behaviour: Climate change may lead to changes in the availability of economic resources. or shifts in the demand for commodities or services. either from production sectors (shift in technologies) or from final demand (shift in preferences). The resulting shift from one general equilibrium prior to climate change to a new general equilibrium posterior to climate change can be interpreted as adaptation.GRACE_adapt is a general equilibrium model for an optional number of regions and economic sectors. The model divides Europe into eight main regions. The selection of regions was made subject to three criteria.

1186938,A meta model based Bayesian approach for building energy models calibration,2017,Jun Yuan and Victor Nian and Bin Su,143,Energy Procedia,,161-166,Elsevier,Buildings contribute a large proportion of energy-related emissions. In order to characterize the buildings’ energy performance. building energy models have been widely used due to their flexibility and convenience. When building energy models are developed to represent the existing buildings. there always exist some unknown or unmeasurable parameters which need to be specified in the simulation models. It is important to calibrate these parameters before applying the building energy models for intended use. In addition. there are various uncertainties in the using of the building energy models. To provide more reliable and confident results for decision making. it is necessary to account for these uncertainties in the calibration procedure. In this paper. a metamodel based Bayesian approach is proposed to calibrate the building energy models.

1186939,Nuclear Power Developments: Could Small Modular Reactor Power Plants be a “Game Changer”? – The ASEAN Perspective,2014,Victor Nian and John Bauly,61,Energy Procedia,ICAE2014,17-20,,Presently. around 13% of the world's electricity is generated by nuclear. Pro-nuclear opinion is that nuclear power is safe. clean. cost-effective. and should be expanded fast. world-wide. to combat the rise in carbon emissions. The contra opinion is that nuclear power is flawed - primarily because it is seen as not safe enough. especially after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Other objections come from concerns about security. large capital investments. and negative public perceptions. The opinions towards nuclear are thus sharply polarized. Several countries have already begun phasing out nuclear power after being committed to it for many years. However. it is arguably unsustainable to completely rule out nuclear from the energy mix. especially in the case of fast developing economies in the Association of the Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).

After that rehearsal. 53 members of the SVC among 61 in attendance were confirmed or strongly suspected to have contracted COVID‐19 and two died. Transmission by the aerosol route is likely; it appears unlikely that either fomite or ballistic droplet transmission could explain a substantial fraction of the cases. It is vital to identify features of cases such as this to better understand the factors that promote superspreading events. Based on a conditional assumption that transmission during this outbreak was dominated by inhalation of respiratory aerosol generated by one index case. we use the available evidence to infer the emission rate of aerosol infectious quanta.

In most buildings the base floor between the first floor apartments and crawl space is not air tight. As the apartments have lower pressure than the crawl space due to ventilation. contaminated air may flow from the crawl space to the apartments. The object of this study was to find out whether a potential air flow from crawl space has an influence on the indoor air quality. The results show that in most cases the concentration of fungal spores was clearly higher in the crawl space than inside the building. The size distribution of fungal spores depended on the fungal species. Correlation between the fungal spores in the crawl space and indoors varied with microbial species. Some species have sources inside the building. which confounds the possible relation between crawl pace and indoor concentrations. Some species. such as Acremonium. do not normally have a source indoors. but its concentration in the crawl space was elevated; our measurements showed also elevated concentrations of Acremonium in the air of the apartments. This consistent finding shows a clear linkage between fungal spores in the indoor air and crawl space.

1186967,Fungal spore transport through a building structure,2004,M Airaksinen and J Kurnitski and P Pasanen and O Seppanen,14,Indoor air,2,92-104,,The study carried out laboratory measurements with a full-scale timber frame structure to determine penetration of inert particles with size distribution from 0.6 to 4 µm and spores of Penicillium and Cladosporium through the structure. Pressure difference over and air leakage through the structure were varied. Measurements at moderate pressure differences resulted in the penetration factors within the range of 0.05 to 0.2 for inert particles. and indicated also the penetration of fungal spores through the structure. The measurements showed that the penetration was highly dependent on pressure difference over the structure but not on holes in surface boards of the structure. The results show that surface contacts between the frames and mineral wool may have a significant effect on penetration. The penetration was approximately constant within particle size rage of 0.6-2.5 µm. but particles with diameter of 4.0 µm did not penetrate through the structure at all even at a higher-pressure difference of 20 Pa. except in the case of direct flow-path through the structure. Results have important consequences for practical design showing that penetration of fungal spores through the building envelope is difficult to prevent by sealing. The only effective way to prevent penetration seems to be balancing or pressurizing the building. In cold climates. moisture condensation risk should be taken into account if pressure is higher indoors than outdoors. Determined penetration factors were highly dependent on the pressure difference.

In multi-story buildings. especially in a cold climate. the performance of units is affected by the stack effect and wind-induced pressure differences between the indoor and the outdoor air. Renovation of the building envelope improves air tightness and the impact of the pressure conditions is amplified. The aim of this study was to predict the air pressure conditions in typical renovated multi-story apartment buildings and to analyze the performance of room-based ventilation units. The field measurements of air pressure differences in a renovated 5-story apartment building during the winter season were conducted and the results were used to simulate whole-year pressure conditions with IDA-ICE software. Performance of two types of single room ventilation units were measured in the laboratory and their suitability as ventilation renovation solutions was assessed with simulations. The results show that one unit stopped its operation as a heat recovery ventilator. In order to ensure satisfactory indoor climate and heat recovery using wall mounted units the pressure difference values were determined and proposed for correct design.

Balanced ventilation is suitable for small (2 - 3-storey) apartment buildings with a suitable room solution for apartments. In larger apartment buildings. the system with the exhaust air heat pump could be used. This is particularly suitable for apartment buildings with mechanical exhaust ventilation. In small apartments. it is most suitable to use room-based air handling units (AHUs) with the recuperative heat exchanger. plus exhaust ventilators in the WC. bathroom and kitchen. The economic indicators of this system are best for two-room apartments.

Proper use of daylighting in retail buildings can reduce energy consumption effectively and additionally improve the quality of light and increase sales and worker’s productivity. The present study analyses daylight potentials and energy performance using different configurations of skylights. deflectors. clerestories and lighting zones for a large space hall-type retail building located in the northern latitude and cold climate of Finland. The scope of the study was to determine the artificial lighting energy reductions for different combinations and the general impact of daylighting features on the energy performance of the building type. The results show electric lighting energy savings potential from a mere 4% in the case of single zone control with only clerestories. up to almost 60% in the case of multi-zone control with skylights. clerestories and without deflectors. The total delivered energy shows increase between 1% and 20% for the different configurations using single zone lighting control and from 6% increase to 4% decrease in cases with multi-zone control. The primary energy results showed up to 1% lower values for single zone and up to 17% lower values for multi-zone control variants.

Airflow fields were created by measuring a grid of 550x550mm with 50mm steps on five vertical planes with a distance of 50mm between the steps. The mean velocity components were measured using two-component laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). Although the airflow patterns indicate short-circuiting of the airflows near the supply and exhaust vents. it can be considered marginal and should be accounted only at low flow rates. It is noted that the supply air jet. due to the Coanda effect. is attracted to the external wall. thus extending the throw distance of the jet.

1187023,Joule: A real-time framework for decentralized sensor networks,2018,John Donnal,5,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,5,3615-3623,IEEE,Traditional Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes transmit raw data to centralized servers for analysis and storage. At higher data rates this architecture is no longer feasible. Instead data must be processed at the lowest level possible to include the sensor node itself. The Joule framework enables decentralized data processing by distributing computation into modules which are dynamically linked at run time by a process supervisor. Modules may be collocated on a single machine or distributed across a network. Data is stored where it is processed creating a fully decentralized architecture. Processed data can be queried by centralized servers or delivered directly to the end user. This allows high bandwidth sensors to be incorporated seamlessly into existing IoT deployments without depleting network bandwidth or server resources.

To address these deficiencies. we have measured and present core loss data for a variety of commercially available magnetic materials in the HF range. In addition. we extend the theory of performance factor for appropriate use in the HF design. Since magnetic materials suitable for HF applications tend to have low permeability. we also consider the impact of low permeability on design. We conclude that. with appropriate material selection and design. increased frequencies can continue to yield improved power density well into the HF regime.,True,ikn9AfcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,113,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7370781/,16646596519625465229,/scholar?cites=16646596519625465229,,https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/99111/Hanson%20ECCE.PDF?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

This study uses measured performance data at the module level for 542 PV systems to estimate lost system performance due to partial shade. Because each of the monitored systems is equipped with module-level dc power optimizers. an estimate is made of the overall system shading loss and the performance improvement that the system has received from this use of DMPPT. The estimate of shade extent and performance improvement predicted by this approach is verified experimentally against a system that has site survey images. and measured production with and without module-level electronics.

1187160,A low-loss inductor structure and design guidelines for high-frequency applications,2019,Rachel S Yang and Alex J Hanson and Bradley A Reese and Charles R Sullivan and David J Perreault,34,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,10,9993-10005,IEEE,Operation in the high-frequency (HF) regime (3-30 MHz) has potential for miniaturizing power electronics. but designing small efficient inductors at HF can be challenging. At these frequencies. losses due to skin and proximity effects are difficult to reduce. and gaps needed to keep B fields low in the core add fringing field loss. We propose a low-loss inductor structure with step-by-step design guidelines for HF applications.

However. when switched at high frequencies. GaN transistors experience high dynamic on resistance which is both detrimental and difficult to measure.

Soft switching techniques could permit higher frequency operation. but most soft-switched converters do not maintain high performance across the wide voltage and power ranges required for PFC applications.

Nevertheless. recent research has made significant advances in miniaturized power electronics operating in the high (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) ranges (3-300 MHz). well above typical modern designs operating from hundreds of kilohertz to a few megahertz.While such advances have been substantial. the design of power magnetics is still not fully understood or optimized. especially in the HF range (3-30 MHz) where use of low-permeability RF magnetic materials can play a valuable role. In part. this lack of understanding owes to a lack of data regarding HF magnetic materials. Magnetic materials are typically characterized for power loss; however. such data are simply not available for most magnetic materials above a few megahertz. hindering the design of magnetics at these frequencies.

Approximate formulae are presented for optimum phase change temperature and the thickness of a PCM wall. Numerical simulations based on the Test Meteorological Years of Helsinki. Finland (60°N) and Madison. Wisconsin (43°N) indicate that a phase change temperature of 1–3°C above the average room temperature would yield optimal diurnal heat storage results. A desired phase change point can be accurately obtained by using fatty acids and their mixtures. To ease the installation.

Ltd.,Irregularities in power output are characteristic of intermittent energy. sources such as wind energy. affecting both the power quality and planning of the energy system. In this work the effects of energy storage to reduce wind power fluctuations are investigated. Integration of the energy storage with wind power is modelled using a filter approach in which a time constant corresponds to the energy storage capacity. The analyses show that already a relatively small energy storage capacity of 3 kWh (storage) per MW wind would reduce the short‐term power fluctuations of an individual wind turbine by 10%. Smoothing out the power fluctuation of the wind turbine on a yearly level would necessitate large storage. e.g. a 10% reduction requires 2–3 MWh per MW wind. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons.

An effective option to increase local renewable energy production is to convert surplus electricity into e.g. thermal energy. Here a methodology to study such multi-carrier urban energy systems is presented which enables to analyze spatial energy demand and supply. and spatial energy flows. The results indicate that in a northern midsized city wind power coupled both to an electric grid and a district heating network could raise the allowable wind capacity over the non-heat case by 40–200%.

Ltd.,This review presents an overview of the current state of research on nanostructured titanium dioxide dye solar cells (DSCs) on alternative substrates to glass. Replacing the traditionally used heavy. rigid. and expensive glass substrate with materials such as plastic foils or metal sheets is crucial to enable large volume cost‐efficient roll‐to‐roll type industrial scale manufacturing of the cells and to make this solar cell technology properly competitive with silicon and thin film photovoltaic devices. One of the biggest problems with plastic substrates is their low‐temperature tolerance. which makes sintering of the photoelectrode films impossible. whereas with metals. their corrosion resistance against the iodine‐containing electrolyte typically used in DSCs limits the amount of metal materials suitable for substrates.

The penetration rates were determined by fitting observed market data to an epidemical diffusion model. The analyses show that the exponential penetration rates of new energy technologies may vary from 4 up to over 40%/yr. The corresponding take-over times from a 1% to 50% share of the estimated market potential may vary from less than 10 to 70 years. The lower rate is often associated with larger energy impacts. Short take-over times less than 25 years seem to be mainly associated with end-use technologies. Public policies and subsides have an important effect on the penetration.

In contrast to the conventional silicon systems. where the semiconductor assumes both the task of light absorption and charge carrier transport the two functions are separated here. Light is absorbed by a sensitizer. which is anchored to the surface of a wide band gap oxide semiconductor.

Carriers are transported in the conduction band of the semiconductor to the charge collector.

The blocking layers increased the open-circuit voltage at low light intensities. At high light intensities. a decrease in the fill factor (FF) due to the additional resistance of the current transport through the layer was more significant than the positive effect by the reduced recombination. The decrease in the FF was reduced by a thermal treatment that made the blocking layer more conductive due to a structural change from an amorphous to a crystalline form.

When the nanoporous dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode film is pressed against the wetted aerogel. it becomes filled with the electrolyte. The electrolyte flows inside the TiO2 film only about ten micrometers (i.e. the TiO2 film thickness) whereas in the conventional filling method. where the electrolyte is pumped through the cell. it flows about 1000-times longer distance. which is known to cause uneven distribution of the electrolyte components due to a molecular filtering effect.

We propose a new procedure for aging tests based on careful planning and scientific reporting. This includes estimating the required sample size for an aging test and avoiding so-called nuisance factors. i.e. unintended variations always present in real world testing.

1187278,Lifetime analysis of dye and perovskite solar cells,2018,Armi Tiihonen,,,,,Aalto University,Dye solar cells (DSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising future photovoltaics technologies. They demonstrate promise in terms of lower costs and mass-production and could thus help transform photovoltaics into a mainstream energy option. Many applications of photovoltaics. such as building integration. require a lifetime of decades to be economically sensible. This work focuses on understanding the aging mechanisms and extending the lifetime of DSCs and PSCs. In DSCs. the insufficient stability of the electrolyte component is a major weakness. Commonly applied liquid electrolytes are difficult to seal reliably into the cell. Thus. a method for sealing large-area cells utilizing nanocellulose aerogel membranes was developed in this work. The main stability challenge is the diminution of charge carriers in electrolyte (i.e.. electrolyte bleaching) when the cells are exposed to environmental stress factors. In this work. purification of electrolyte solvent was observed to halve the progress of bleaching when the cells were exposed to ultraviolet light (UV). Also the application of a UV filter and the change of the redox couple from iodine to cobalt complex effectively suppressed the bleaching. Cobalt complex electrolytes have been regarded as unstable but here it was detected for the first time that the cobalt complex bleaches at a slower rate in comparison to the traditional iodine electrolyte. A perovskite precursor ink was developed in this work for printing carbon based PSCs. In this respect. all the material layers of the cell were manufactured accurately using upscalable methods.

1187281,Extreme sensitivity of dye solar cells to UV‐induced degradation,2021,Aapo Poskela and Kati Miettunen and Armi Tiihonen and Peter D Lund,9,Energy Science & Engineering,1,19-26,,Present practice to avoid harmful effects of UV light on dye solar cells (DSC) is to use a UV filter. However. we show here that a standard 400 nm UV cutoff filter offers inadequate protection from UV‐induced degradation. DSCs that were exposed to only visible light by LED lamps maintained 100% of their initial efficiency after 3000 hours of exposure. whereas the efficiency of DSCs subjected to full light spectrum (Xenon arc lamp) with an efficient UV filter dropped down to 10% of their initial performance already after 1500 hours. Optical analysis of the UV filter confirmed that the amount of light transmitted below 400 nm was negligible. These observations indicate that (a) DSCs can be very sensitive to even minor amount of UV and (b) eliminating the effects of UV light on DSC stability cannot easily be avoided by a UV filter on top of the cell. A detailed analysis of the degradation mechanisms revealed that the culprit …,True,0pLOTKcAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ese3.810,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ese3.810,0,0,0

While such measurements deserve the utmost attention to avoid crude and systematic errors. because of the complex phenomena associated with PSCs (current-voltage hysteresis and efficiency recovery). more profound considerations on the quality of aging testing would likewise be welcome.Most of the aging tests on PSCs fail to document the testing conditions satisfactorily (2)–a recent study (3) showed that less than one third of light soaking tests reported the UV and visible light intensities that were applied.

Compositional search within multinary perovskites employing brute force synthesis followed by environmental tests are prohibitively expensive in large chemical spaces. To identify the most stable multi-cation lead iodide perovskites containing Cs. formamidinium (FA) and methylammonium (MA). we fuse results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ thin-film degradation test within an end-toend machine learning (ML) algorithm to inform the compositional optimization of CsxMAyFA1-xyPbI3. We integrate phase thermodynamics modelling as a probabilistic constraint in a Bayesian optimization (BO) loop. which effectively guides the experimental search while considering both structural and environmental stability. After three optimization rounds and only sampling 1.8% of the compositional space. we identify thin-film compositions centred at Cs0. 17MA0. 03FA0. 80PbI3 that achieve a 3x delay in macroscopic degradation onset under elevated temperature. humidity. and light compared with the more complex state-of-the-art Cs0. 05 (MA0. 17FA0. 83) 0.95Pb (I0. 83Br0. 17) 3.

1187293,Shear and torsion correction factors  of Timo s henko beam model  f or generic cross sections,2015,Jouni Freund and Alp Karakoç,,Research on Engineering Structures and Materials,,,,The standard Timoshenko beam model assumes that cross sections of beam move as rigid bodies in deformation which is a well-known source for modelling error. In refined beam models. a warping displacement part of the kinematic assumption aims to reduce the modelling error due to that source. Improved kinematics have an effect on the constitutive equation and may also affect the beam equations. Effective properties and corrections factors for the standard constitutive equation are the most popular ways to represent the effect on the constitutive equation. Warping in pure torsion is a classical topic and St. Venant’s theory of uniform torsion is considered as the correct way to calculate the effective polar moment of a cross section [1]. Discussion on the warping displacement and correction factor eg in pure shear seems not to have settled yet and. even in the simplest case of rectangular cross section of isotropic material. a general agreement on methodology and value of the factor is lacking [2-12].A generic computational method for finding the warping displacement and the effective constitutive equation of an elastic Timoshenko beam is suggested. The method exploits the ideas presented already in [4] but combines these in a novel manner to extend St. Venant’s theory of uniform torsion to generic loading of beam. The starting point consists of virtual work expression of full elasticity problem and a set of kinematic assumptions. To end up with a coherent theory. principle of virtual work is used to find the equations associated with the standard beam displacement and warping displacement parts.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM). one of the most widely used additive manufacturing methods. owes its popularity to cost effectiveness in material and equipment investment. Current efforts are aimed toward high load-bearing capacity at low material costs. However. the mechanical reliability of end-products derived from these compositions and their dependence on microstructural effects. have remained as major limitations. This is mainly owing to the unknown mechanics of the materials. including the reinforcing or filler components and their interphase/interface compatibility. For this reason. here we investigate the most relevant commercial polymeric materials used in composite filaments. associated phases and the characterization protocols that can guide component selection. screening and troubleshooting. We first present thermal analyses (thermogravimetric. TGA and differential scanning calorimetry.

The influence of various fillers is unveiled in terms of the crystallization behavior of derived 3D-printed parts. To understand the microstructural effects on the material strength. we carry out a series of tensile experiments on 3-D printed dog-bone shaped specimens following ISO standards.

1187307,Optimal automated path planning for infinitesimal and real-sized particle assemblies,2017,Alp Karakoc and Ertugrul Taciroglu,4,AIMS Materials Science,4,847-855,AIMS Press,The present article introduces an algorithm for path planning and assembly of infinitesimal and real-sized particles by using a distance and path based permutation algorithm. The main objective is to define non-overlapping particle paths subject to minimal total path length during particles positioning and assembly. Thus. a local minimum is sought with a low computational cost. For this reason. an assignment problem. to be specific Euclidean bipartite matching problem. is presented. where the particles in the initial (random selection) and final (particle assembly) configurations are in one-to-one correspondence. The cost function for particle paths is defined through Euclidean distance of each particle between the initial and final configurations. Principally. a cost flow problem is formed and solved by determining an optimal permutation subject to the total Euclidean distance of the particles and their non-overlapping paths. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for non-overlapping paths; thus. non-colliding particles. and then total path distances of the obtained sets are minimized. resulting in an optimal solution which may not be necessarily the global optimum. Case studies on basic and complex shaped infinitesimal and real-sized particle assemblies are shown with their total costs. ie. path lengths.

Their deformation and failure characteristics are dependent on the geometrical and spatial properties of constituents [7-9].Due to direct correlation and accuracy. there have been extensive microstructural modelling investigations on fiber networks in two and three dimensional space [10-15]. The earliest two dimensional network models were based on random line generation and consolidation in transverse plane. Two dimensional models have been successfully used to determine the in-plane properties where the specimen thickness is of order of one tenth or less of average fiber length and negligible [5]. However. determination of three dimensional properties necessitates an additional dimension. for which the fibers can be deposited and bend on top of each other [16].

For the efficient use of these materials. a profound understanding of the relationship between their mechanical and geometrical properties in the transverse plane is necessary. Hence. in order to contribute to the fields of the cellular material modeling and testing. the present study comprising physical and simulation experiments was conducted.       The physical experiments were conducted to determine the effective stiffness properties of the cellular materials in the transverse plane. In these experiments. two different cellular materials. Nomex honeycombs and Norway spruce (Picea abies). were investigated. The experimental data were obtained through the proposed experimental method which involves testing of specimens of different material orientations relative to the loading direction. A benefit of the method is its ability to combine the anisotropic linear elasticity with the physical experiments. Hence. in addition to the effective in-plane elastic moduli and Poisson's ratios. the shear modulus and coefficients of mutual influence characterizing the coupling between the shearing and normal stresses were also determined.

A review,2007,Martin A Hubbe and Richard A Venditti and Orlando J Rojas,2,,4,739-788,,Both reversible and irreversible changes take place as cellulosic fibers are manufactured into paper products one or more times. This review considers both physical and chemical changes. It is proposed that by understanding these changes one can make better use of cellulosic fibers at various stages of their life cycles. achieving a broad range of paper performance characteristics. Some of the changes that occur as a result of recycling are inherent to the fibers themselves. Other changes may result from the presence of various contaminants associated with the fibers as a result of manufacturing processes and uses. The former category includes an expected loss of swelling ability and decreased wet-flexibility. especially when kraft fibers are dried.

Transportation fuel represents a large proportion of energy consumption. not only in the US. but also world-wide. As fossil fuel is being depleted. new substitutes are needed to provide energy. Ethanol. which has been produced mainly from the fermentation of corn starch in the US. has been regarded as one of the main liquid transportation fuels that can take the place of fossil fuel. However. limitations in the supply of starch are creating a need for different substrates. Forest biomass is believed to be one of the most abundant sources of sugars. although much research has been reported on herbaceous grass. agricultural residue. and municipal waste. The use of biomass sugars entails pretreatment to disrupt the lignin-carbohydrate complex and expose carbohydrates to enzymes. This paper reviews pretreatment technologies from the perspective of their potential use with wood. bark. and forest residues. Acetic acid catalysis is suggested for the first time to be used in steam explosion pretreatment. Its pretreatment economics. as well as that for ammonia fiber explosion pretreatment. is estimated.

Solar power is recommended due to its natural abundance. is renewable and non-polluting. Its almost uniform thermal energy distribution in Saudi Arabia makes this particular energy source inexpensive and extremely suitable for the locality. The aim of this paper is to design an innovative water desalination system using solar energy integrated with a subsurface condensation that functions as a geothermal cooling system. The operational dynamics and efficacy of the system are investigated via experimental tests. The results show that the fresh potable water productivity increases by about 80% for the modified solar distiller compared to the ordinary distiller without reflectors.

1187393,Energy and Exergy Analyses of Stirling Engine using CFD Approach,2021,Sherihan El-Ghafour and Nady Mikhael and Mohamed El-Ghandour,77,Journal of Advanced Research in Fluid Mechanics and Thermal Sciences,1,100-123,,A comprehensive characterization of the GPU-3 Stirling engine losses with the aid of the CFD approach is presented. Firstly. a detailed description of the losses-related phenomena along with the method of calculating each type of loss are addressed. Secondly. an energy analysis of the engine is carried out in order to specify the impact of each type of losses on the performance. Finally. the design effectivity of each component of the engine is investigated using an exergy analysis. The results reveal that the hysteresis loss occurs mainly within the working spaces due to the flow jetting during the first part of the expansion strokes. Additionally. the pressure difference between the working spaces is the main driver for the flow leakage through the appendix gap. The exposure of the displacer top wall to the jet of hot gas flowing into the expansion space during expansion stroke essentially increases the shuttle heat loss. A new definition for the regenerator effectiveness is presented to assess the quality of the heat storage and recovery processes. The energy analysis shows that regenerator thermal loss and pumping power represent the largest part of the engine losses by about 9.2% and 7.5% of the heat input. respectively. The exergy losses within regenerator and cold space are the highest values among the components. consequently. they need to be redesigned.,True,nm2DGLAAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,http://www.akademiabaru.com/submit/index.php/arfmts/article/view/776,,,,http://www.akademiabaru.com/submit/index.php/arfmts/article/download/776/2652,0,0,0

Faculty of Engineering,This study presents the numerical investigation of the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics for three different high viscous fluids (Engine oil. Oil (SN-500) and Ethylene glycol) flowing inside horizontal rotating tubes. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology using ANSYS FLUENT 14.0 is used to perform the numerical analysis by solving the Navier-Stokes and energy equations through the viscous model at all cases of rotation Reynolds numbers and Reynolds numbers. The investigation is conducted at rotation speed of 25. 50. 100. 500. 1000 and 2000 rpm and Reynolds number ranged between 5 and 10 for Engine oil. 54 and 109 for Oil (SN500) and 425 and 849 for Ethylene glycol. The results revealed that. enhancement of heat transfer in the tubes with Ethylene glycol (lower viscous fluid) increases slightly with the further increase in rotation speed. This is because of the viscous effects which are observed significantly larger in the tubes with Ethylene glycol than those in the tubes with Engine oil and Oil (SN-500). These effects weakened growing of the tangential velocity component in the flow. In the tubes with Engine oil and Oil (SN-500). the maximum values of thermal performance factor are found at rotation speed of 1000 rpm. whereas. in the tubes with Ethylene glycol are occurred at rotation speed of 100 rpm. The value of the maximum thermal performance is about 2.1 for tube with Engine oil at a Reynolds number of 10. 1.6 for tube with Oil (SN-500) at a Reynolds number of 109 and 1.44 for tube with Ethylene glycol at a Reynolds number of 849.,True,nm2DGLAAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://journals.ekb.eg/article_32475.html,,,,https://journals.ekb.eg/article_32475_554d74018d9ddc12b2cac767139284b2.pdf,0,0,0

Faculty of Engineering,The present work shows the results obtained from the numerical simulation of the heat transfer enhancement for the high viscous flow inside horizontal axially rotating tubes. using twisted tapes with the different twist and width ratios. The simulation is performed with the twisted tapes of three twist ratios (TR = 5. 7.5 and 10) and four width ratios (WR = 0.9. 0.7. 0.5 and 0.3). Rotation Reynolds number and Reynolds number are ranged from 0.9 to 5927 and 5 to 849. respectively. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology using ANSYS FLUENT 14.0 is used to perform the numerical analysis by solving the Navier-Stokes and energy equations through the viscous model at all cases of rotation Reynolds numbers and Reynolds numbers. The results revealed that. thermal performance factor due to the insertion of the twisted tapes in rotating tubes is strongly depended on the rotation speed. The increase in rotation speed decreases the thermal performance factor for tubes with Engine oil and Oil (SN-500). Whereas. in the tubes with Ethylene glycol. the thermal performance factor increases as the rotation speed increases. The influence of the twist ratio variation on the friction factor and heat transfer is small. as compared with the tape width ratio. The best twisted tape geometry. to achieve best thermal performance is found at WR of 0.9 for tubes with Engine oil and Oil (SN-500). and 0.5 for tubes with Ethylene glycol.,True,nm2DGLAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://journals.ekb.eg/article_32476.html,,,,https://journals.ekb.eg/article_32476_78b909998514ed62036d84f24c911f91.pdf,0,0,0

Faculty of Engineering,Low grade waste heat utilization and new combustion technology are challenging tasks for researchers to achieve these objectives. This paper is concerned with the integration of coal gasification system with a combined gas turbine. steam turbine power plant cycles and with ammonia-water cycle. which is known as Kalina cycle. Al-maghara coal in North Sinai is used as the solid fuel in gasification process.Three cycles configurationsare compared as follows: Scheme (A) with dual pressure Heat recovery boiler with the condenser of steam cycle as the evaporator for Kalina cycle.scheme (B) with heat recovery boiler for both of steam and Kalina cycleand scheme (C). similar to scheme (A). but with a superheating in Kalina cycleto identify the most promising one for implementation. Key parameters of Kalina cycle were the main elements of comparison. Results revealed that scheme (A) has the best performance with regard to the output power. thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumption. Substantially. the integration of Kalina cycle with coal gasification combined cycle counterbalances the reduction of the overall efficiency due to the gasification thermal efficiency. Therefore. integration of Kalina cycle in the ICGCC is justified.Furthermore. part load calculations were made for scheme (A) and identified that the integration of Kalina cycle to ICGCC imposed restrictions to Kalina cycle constrains. so that it is more economical to keep such configuration of combined plants at nearly full load conditions.,True,nm2DGLAAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://journals.ekb.eg/article_46707.html,,,,https://journals.ekb.eg/article_46707_a386665661e9507908b6ff69bccb091f.pdf,0,0,0

Egypt. This is an alternative cooling system in the sense that an earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) is employed to firstly pre-cool the ambient air which is then implemented to cool the back surface of the PV panel to simultaneously improve the PV panel performance. It was possible to decrease the PV module temperature from an average 55 °C (without cooling) to 42 °C with the help of geothermal pre-cooled air flow over the back surface of a PV module at an optimum rate of 0.0288 m3/s.

The consumptive use of water includes evaporation loss. seepage loss and water exchanges requirements. The water requirement has been estimated to be10.3 m3/Kg of fish production under present study for semi-intensive culture and with supplemental feeding. Out of which7.6 m3/Kg of fish production is system associated requirement. On an average the evaporation loss from the pond is1498.3 mm/year and seepage loss per year is about1182.60 mm/year. Seepage and water exchange losses recharge the ground water aquifers and if they are treated and recycled. the water use in aquaculture can be reduced significantly.

The hourly parameters such as moisture evaporation. prawn temperature and relative humidity inside greenhouse have been recorded during the process of complete drying of prawn. These parameters were used for determination of the convective heat transfer coefficient. Convective heat transfer coefficients are mainly dependent on the rate of moisture transfer under the drying process. Among different curve fitting. a quadratic curve exhibited best relation between convective heat transfer coefficient and drying time as it gave the maximum coefficient of determination (R 2= 99.04%).,True,8XK4uyUAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,16,http://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/download/682/676,9067834479710572052,/scholar?cites=9067834479710572052,,http://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/download/682/676,0,0,0

The common carp (Cyprinus carpio) fry 26.15+ 0.44 g (total mean weight+ SD) grew to 116.40+ 0.92 g. 112.80+ 0.62 g. 90.20+ 2.45 g and 81.30+ 2.60 g in 105 days in tank 1. 2. 3 and 4. respectively. In all the tanks. the fish appeared healthy and no mortality was observed. Inside greenhouse fish production showed significantly (p< 0.05) higher in comparison with open system. Days 0-15 specific growth rate increased and decreasing trend was observed between 15-90 days. The observed body weight was highly correlated (r= 0.99) with predicted body weight. Feed conversion efficiencies (FCE) differed among all tanks. the highest FCE being found inside greenhouse and lowest in open condition. Water quality parameters were acceptable range for fish culture in both the condition. Results show that in even span greenhouse. water temperature can be increased (3.58–6.79 oC) compared with outside tanks in the composite climate of New Delhi.,True,8XK4uyUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,9,http://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/download/649/643,2236981763149067889,/scholar?cites=2236981763149067889,,http://cigrjournal.org/index.php/Ejounral/article/download/649/643,0,0,0

Traditional crop establishment. ie puddling and transplanting. requires large amount of water. energy and labour. which are becoming scarce and expensive (Mishra and Singh 2012). Weeds are considered to be one of the major biotic constraints in achieving the higher crop productivity as they cause a reduction of 10-90% grain yield in rice field (Kumar et al. 2016). System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a modern and alternative method of rice cultivation for reduced use of seed. water and labour and to increase the crop productivity. But this system is much infested with weeds because growing under the limited water management. Echinochloa spp.. Cynodon dactylon. Portulaca quadrifida and Cyperus spp. are the major weeds associated with SRI. Herbicides were proved effective but the continuous and indiscriminate use of herbicides for a longer period may result in buildup of problematic weeds and development of herbicide resistance. Adoption of rotary or cono-weeder use in SRI plays a significant role in improving the growth. yield and economics of rice. Weed management with improved tools not only uproot the weeds between crop rows but also ensuring the better soil aeration. Different type of weeders are available for weeding but all these designs are location specific and designed to meet the requirement of soil type. crop grown. cropping pattern and availability of the local resources (Goel et al. 2008).

Salinity was an important parameter in controlling the sediment–water interactions and the fate or transport of PFOS in the aquatic environment. As the salinity (S‰) increased from 0.18 to 3.31. the distribution coefficient (Kd) between sediment and water linearly increased from 0.76 to 4.70 L g−1.

CTAB remarkably enhanced the sorption of PFOS on the sediment. In contrast. the influence of SDBS to the sorption of PFOS was concentration dependent. Two contrasting factors were responsible for the phenomenon. One was the sorption of the surfactant itself to the sediment. which enhanced the sorption of PFOS. The other was the increase in solubility of PFOS caused by the adding of surfactants. which decreased the sorption of PFOS. SDBS had a much lower sorption capacity. but rather strong ability to increase the solubility of PFOS. High levels of SDBS remarkably reduced the sorption of PFOS on the sediment.

Theoretical,1998,Gang Pan and Peter S Liss,201,Journal of colloid and interface science,1,71-76,Academic Press,It is proposed that a fundamental deficiency in the existing theoretical foundation of surface adsorption is that adsorption density (Γ) is incorrectly used as a state variable. A metastable-equilibrium inequality is obtained when Γ is not treated as a state variable. The inequality indicates that experimentally measured “equilibrium” adsorption constants for a given adsorption system decrease as the actual metastable-equilibrium adsorption states deviate from the ideal equilibrium state. Isotherms. when expressed in terms of Γ. can therefore be fundamentally influenced by the kinetics of the adsorption process. This implies that previously measured equilibrium adsorption data may show a lack of consistency. thereby making the use and comparison of the data problematic.

1187889,Increase in biodegradation of dimethyl phthalate by Closterium lunula using inorganic carbon,2004,Hai Yan and Gang Pan,55,Chemosphere,9,1281-1285,Pergamon,The effect and mechanism of inorganic carbon (IC) on the biodegradation of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) by a green microalga Closterium lunula was investigated. The growth of this microalga and the biodegradation of DMP were significantly enhanced when the initial IC was increased. An intermediate product of DMP biodegradation was identified as phthalic acid (PA) that was accumulated and caused a sharp decrease in pH of microalgal culture medium. which inhibited both the growth of microalga and the biodegradation of DMP.

A meta-analysis of 51 selected studies is performed to evaluate ARGs abundance trends over the last 7 years. WaferGen TM SmartChip is found to be the most widely used HT-qPCR platform among others for evaluating ARGs. Up till now around 1000 environmental samples (excluding biological replicates) from different parts of the world have been analyzed on HT-qPCR. Calculated detection frequency and normalized ARGs abundance (ARGs/16S rRNA gene) reported in gut microbiome studies have shown a trend of low ARGs as compared to other environmental matrices. Disparities in the HT-qPCR data analysis which are causing difficulties to researchers in precise interpretation of results have been highlighted and a possible way forward for resolving them is also suggested. The potential of other amplification technologies and point of care or field deployable devices for analyzing ARGs have also been discussed in the review.

To evaluate the role of small scale poultry slaughterhouses in resistance dissemination in Pakistan. a comparative genomic analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the gut microbiome of broiler and household chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) was performed. An array of 52 qPCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. ARGs and MGEs was used in the experiment to analyse the abundance of selected genes in collected samples. A total of 22 ARGs and 7 MGEs were detected in all samples. The detection frequency of specific gene classes and diversity of genes was found to be higher in broiler as compared to household chicken. Sul1 was the most abundant ARG with the highest percent relative abundance (2.4%). Total percent relative abundance of ARGs in broiler chicken was found to be significantly (p< 0.05) greater than household chicken fecal samples. A significant linear correlation (R2= 0.89) was found between relative abundances of int1 and total ARGs. The clustering and correlation of selective ARGs with MGEs has implied that small scale poultry slaughterhouses can be a potential source for the dissemination of ARGs to other non-resistant environmental and/or clinical bacteria.,True,IV0jweAAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hassan_Waseem/publication/331313181_Potential_Dissemination_of_Antimicrobial_Resistance_From_Small_Scale_Poultry_Slaughterhouses_in_Pakistan/links/5c72bb2992851c69503dfca7/Potential-Dissemination-of-Antimicrobial-Resistance-From-Small-Scale-Poultry-Slaughterhouses-in-Pakistan.pdf,14120949971692941137,/scholar?cites=14120949971692941137,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hassan_Waseem/publication/331313181_Potential_Dissemination_of_Antimicrobial_Resistance_From_Small_Scale_Poultry_Slaughterhouses_in_Pakistan/links/5c72bb2992851c69503dfca7/Potential-Dissemination-of-Antimicrobial-Resistance-From-Small-Scale-Poultry-Slaughterhouses-in-Pakistan.pdf,0,0,0

The results show that the effectiveness of this system was significantly higher compared to direct photolysis. The influence of parameters such as photocatalyst loading and initial concentration of the substrate was studied. The study of the influence of pH shows that the reduction rates are grater for acid solutions. Furthermore the experimental results show that the presence of H2O2 at small concentration (10-6M) accelerates the reduction. However at higher concentration (10-4M) H2O2 inhibits the reduction.

TiO2–Montmorillonite-based composites have attracted a great deal of attention as efficient photocatalysts for the degradation/reduction of organic contaminants and heavy metals in waters and wastewaters . It can be claimed that the most popular benefits of using TiO2–Montmorillonite photocatalysts are an enhancement in the photocatalytic removal of contaminants due to their high adsorption capacity. high photocatalytic activity of nanoscaled TiO2 deposited on Montmorillonite surface and low costs. Otherwise. the use of naked nanoscaled TiO2 is not recommended because of its low adsorption ability. fast agglomeration in water and due to the issue of recovery of such small particles from water.

B-TiO2 samples were prepared by impregnation with TiCl4 with different weight ratios (g/g)(namely. 5. 10. 20 and 30%). Materials were characterized using different techniques. among which: SEM. FT-IR. XRD. HRTEM. EDX and Zeta potential measurements. Results show that. only the anatase TiO2 polymorph was formed in the bentonite and the porosity of materials decreases with the increase of TiO2 content. Furthermore. zeta potential measurements indicate that. when TiO2 content increases. the negative charge of materials decreases. On the other hand. experimental results show that these materials combine both adsorption and photocatalytic reactions to remove CV molecules from water. As the TiO2 content increases. the adsorption capacity decreases. while the photocatalytic activity is more important. In the case of Cr (VI) species. all samples show a few adsorption because of the repulsion effect between these species and the negative charge of the bentonite.

A meta-analysis of 51 selected studies is performed to evaluate ARGs abundance trends over the last 7 years. WaferGen TM SmartChip is found to be the most widely used HT-qPCR platform among others for evaluating ARGs. Up till now around 1000 environmental samples (excluding biological replicates) from different parts of the world have been analyzed on HT-qPCR. Calculated detection frequency and normalized ARGs abundance (ARGs/16S rRNA gene) reported in gut microbiome studies have shown a trend of low ARGs as compared to other environmental matrices. Disparities in the HT-qPCR data analysis which are causing difficulties to researchers in precise interpretation of results have been highlighted and a possible way forward for resolving them is also suggested. The potential of other amplification technologies and point of care or field deployable devices for analyzing ARGs have also been discussed in the review.

To evaluate the role of small scale poultry slaughterhouses in resistance dissemination in Pakistan. a comparative genomic analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in the gut microbiome of broiler and household chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) was performed. An array of 52 qPCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene. ARGs and MGEs was used in the experiment to analyse the abundance of selected genes in collected samples. A total of 22 ARGs and 7 MGEs were detected in all samples. The detection frequency of specific gene classes and diversity of genes was found to be higher in broiler as compared to household chicken. Sul1 was the most abundant ARG with the highest percent relative abundance (2.4%). Total percent relative abundance of ARGs in broiler chicken was found to be significantly (p< 0.05) greater than household chicken fecal samples. A significant linear correlation (R2= 0.89) was found between relative abundances of int1 and total ARGs.
