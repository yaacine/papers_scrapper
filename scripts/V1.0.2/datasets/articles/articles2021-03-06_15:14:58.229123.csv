The import of hydrogen generated by means of CO2 free wind electricity from overseas can be a promising option for Japan's prospective energy supply. Besides different other factors like specific costs of electrolyzers and hydrogen shipment over long distances. the economically reasonable export of hydrogen based on renewable energy requires low levelized costs of electricity.

Since the volatile character of wind and solar radiation leads to a fluctuating power production. these renewables are incapable of providing reliable base load power. To enable the transition to a renewable energy system. large-scale energy storage is required to compensate for short-term and seasonal imbalances and to save temporary excess power. Due to the order of magnitude involved. this can best be achieved by converting electricity into hydrogen via electrolysis. a process that is also called “power to gas”.

For this reason. interest is increasing in the feasibility of deploying captured CO2 in this manner.

Of all the sources of CO2 emissions. power plants burning fossil fuels. especially coals. account for a very large portion. For CO2 capture from existing coal-fired power plants. post-combustion technology is thus far considered the most viable method due to its “end-of-pipe” characteristic. Chemical absorption or scrubbing process is currently the technology most likely to be implemented in the near future but rather energy-intensive.

A widely used method to measure the methanol permeation in a DMFC is the analysis of the carbon dioxide content of the cathode exhaust. During the operation of a DMFC large amounts of carbon dioxide are produced in the anodic catalyst layer which can diffuse partially to the cathode. As a consequence the carbon dioxide in the cathodic exhaust gas stream is expected to consist of two fractions: the carbon dioxide resulting from the oxidation of the permeating methanol and the carbon dioxide diffusing from the anode to the cathode.

Moreover. the temperature dependence of the hydrogen and oxygen permeabilities through Nafion in the fully hydrated state (where the water content is independent of the temperature) were measured in order to determine the activation energies of the permeation mechanisms.

Due to the fluctuating nature of RESs. it is necessary to install more wind and photovoltaics (PVs) generation in terms of nominal power than would otherwise be required in order to ensure that the power demand can always be met. In a near fully RES-based energy system. there will be times when there is an inadequate conventional load to meet the overcapacity of RESs. which will lead to demand regularly being exceeded and thereby a surplus. One approach to making productive use of this surplus. which would lead to a holistic transformation of all sectors. is “sector coupling”(SC). This paper describes the general principles behind this concept and develops a working definition intended to be of utility to the international scientific community. Furthermore. a literature review provides an overview of relevant scientific papers on the topic. Due to the challenge of distinguishing between papers with or without SC. the approach adopted here takes the German context as a case study that can be applied to future reviews with an international focus. Finally. to evaluate the potential of SC. an analysis of the linking of the power and transport sectors on a worldwide. EU and German level has been conducted and is outlined here.

This approach is particularly useful in developing the bio renewable-based energy solutions and chemicals manufacturing. where multiple criteria must be evaluated and where the optimisation-based decision making process is particularly attractive.

However. modern membrane process development experiences a disconnect in this domain: the synthesis of the membrane and the design of the process are decoupled. We propose an optimization strategy to simultaneously design the performance of layer-by-layer nanofiltration membrane modules along with the separation process. This approach achieves overall optimal performance by extending the search space and thus exploiting synergies. Better separation performances at a lower cost as compared to conventional optimization strategies can be achieved.

Often. Gaussian processes are trained on datasets and are subsequently embedded as surrogate models in optimization problems. These optimization problems are nonconvex and global optimization is desired.

We propose a reduced-space formulation for deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes embedded. For optimization. the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the degrees of freedom and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian process models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and computationally cheaper subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further accelerate convergence. we derive envelopes of common covariance functions for GPs and tight relaxations of acquisition functions used in Bayesian optimization including expected improvement. probability of improvement. and lower confidence bound.

One of the most serious challenges is how information on the small displays is presented optimally. This paper addresses the special problem of the increasing number of aged users. On the one hand. information displayed should be easily readable. This requires a low information density and a sufficiently large font size. On the other hand menu orientation is facilitated when the amount of information per screen is maximized and a large preview is allowed. This requires presenting as many functions as possible on the screen at a time. Thus. the tradeoff between readability and orientation demands is crucial. In the present study. this tradeoff was experimentally investigated. Two factors. font size (8 pt. 12 pt) and the size of the preview (one or five functions per screen at a time) were varied and effects on navigation performance were …,True,yc1wXwUAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,98,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687010000463,15263199470156623592,/scholar?cites=15263199470156623592,,https://www.academia.edu/download/50561682/j.apergo.2010.03.00120161126-6550-1la3ehp.pdf,0,0,0

We argue that this is due to the specifics of benchmarking criteria in medical scenarios and the multitude of drastically differing end-user groups and the enormous context-complexity of the medical domain. Here both risk perceptions towards data security and privacy as well as trust in safe technical systems play a central and specific role. particularly in the clinical context. These aspects dominate acceptance of such systems. By using a Doctor-in-the-Loop approach some of these difficulties could be mitigated by combining both human expertise with computer efficiency.

1158014,Lean blowoff of bluff body stabilized flames: Scaling and dynamics,2009,Santosh J Shanbhogue and Sajjad Husain and Tim Lieuwen,35,,1,98-120,Pergamon,This paper overviews the dynamics of bluff body stabilized flames and describes the phenomenology of the blowoff process. The first section of the paper provides an overview of the fluid mechanics of the non-reacting and reacting bluff body wake flow. It highlights the key features of the flow (the boundary layer. separated shear layer. and wake). the flow instabilities that influence each of these features. and the influences of the flame on these instabilities. A key point from these studies is the large differences between the non-reacting wake (dominated by an absolutely unstable. sinuous instability associated with vortex shedding from the bluff body) and the reacting wake of high dilatation ratio flames. The latter are dominated by the lower intensity. convective instability of the shear layer. Very low dilatation ratio flames begin to approach the behavior of the non-reacting wake. as might be expected.Next. the paper …,True,oY31AqwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,494,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360128508000427,14184521663543417545,/scholar?cites=14184521663543417545,,,0,0,0

In order to elucidate these flow-flame interactions during an instability. an experimental and computational investigation of the flame-sheet dynamics of a harmonically excited flame was performed. It is shown that the flame dynamics are controlled by three key processes: excitation of shear layer instabilities by the axially oscillating flow. anchoring of the flame at the bluff body. and the kinematic response of the flame to this forcing. The near-field flame features are controlled by flame anchoring and the far-field by kinematic restoration. In the near-field. the flame response grows with downstream distance due to flame anchoring. which prevents significant flame movement near the attachment point.

In many cases. the flame is stabilized in the separating shear layer near the centerbody or abrupt expansion. where the high-speed nozzle flow transitions into the larger combustor. Several prior studies have shown that the flame position becomes increasingly unsteady as it approaches blowoff. due to local extinction and reattachment of the flame at one or both of these locations. This is apparently due to the local strain rate irregularly oscillating about the extinction strain rate values near the attachment point. In order to characterize these flame strain characteristics. particle image velocimetry measurements were obtained of several hydrogen/methane mixtures in this attachment region.

This work is motivated by observations that flames near blowoff exhibit a variety of transient characteristics. We believe that this unsteadiness is not simply a result of the flame’s proximity to blowoff. but also an important contributor to the processes ultimately leading to blowoff. As such. if this hypothesis is correct. then understanding and predicting blowoff requires a treatment of these dynamical processes. Moreover. it implies that classic blowoff explanations relying on purely steady state characteristics of the flow. such as a characteristic residence time and chemical time. are necessarily incomplete.

Calculations are performed for a wide range of mixtures of CH4/H2/air (0.35 ≤ ϕ ≤ 0.75. 0 ≤ %H2 ≤ 40. 300 ≤ Tin [K] ≤ 500) in order to systematically vary the burning velocity (2.0–35.6 cm/s). dilatation ratio (2.7–6.4). and extinction strain rate (106–2924 1/s). The model is based on a fully resolved unsteady two-dimensional flow with detailed chemistry and species transport. and with no artificial flame anchoring boundary conditions.

By lowering flame temperatures. lean-premixed combustion has the potential to nearly eliminate emissions of thermally generated nitric oxides. but the chamber acoustics and heat release rate are highly susceptible to coupling in ways that lead to sustained. high-amplitude pressure oscillations. known as combustion instability. At different operating conditions. different modes of instability are observed. corresponding to particular flame shapes and resonant acoustic modes. Here we show that in a swirl-stabilized combustor. these instability modes also correspond to particular interactions between the flame and the inner recirculation zone. Two stable and two unstable modes are examined. At lean equivalence ratios. a stable conical flame anchors on the upstream edge of the inner recirculation zone and extends …,True,oY31AqwAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,23,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748910001586,8994518907247389942,/scholar?cites=8994518907247389942,,,0,0,0

To verify the feasibility of the concept. a multi-scale analysis was conducted to understand the design requirements. underlying chemistry. intra-particle effects. and overall reactor-scale heat transfer. We demonstrate that the heat transfer within the reactor and the appropriate reactor height is largely determined by gas-phase advection. Finally. by implementing a laboratory-scale reactor and operating it under diverse conditions. we show that such a design can indeed satisfy the requirements for torrefaction. This lays the basis for the second part of this two-part paper. where we develop a detailed mathematical model for this concept.

In order to numerically capture the inherent unsteadiness exhibited in the flow. the large eddy simulation (LES) technique based on the artificial flame thickening combustion model is employed. The experimental data are obtained using particle image velocimetry. It is observed that changes in heat loading. in the presence of wall confinement. significantly influence the flow field in the wake region. the stabilization location of the flame. and the flame intensity.

1158036,Dynamics of perturbed exothermic bluff-body flow-fields,2008,Santosh Janardhan Shanbhogue,,,,,,This thesis describes research on acoustically excited bluff body flow-fields. motivated by the problem of combustion instabilities in devices utilizing these types of flame-holders. Vortices/convective-structures play a dominant role in perturbing the flame during these combustion instabilities. This thesis addresses a number of issues related to the origin. evolution and the interaction of these structures with the flame.  The first part of this thesis reviews the fluid mechanics of non-reacting and reacting bluff body flows.  The second part describes the spatio/temporal characteristics of bluff-body flames responding to excitation. The key processes controlling the flame response have been identified as 1) the anchoring of the flame at the bluff body. 2) the excitation of flame-front wrinkles by the oscillating velocity field and 3) flame propagation normal to itself at the local flame speed. The first two processes control the growth of the flame response and the last process controls the decay.  The third part of this thesis describes the effect of acoustic excitation on the velocity field of reacting bluff body flows. Acoustic disturbances excite the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability of the reacting shear layer. This leads to a spatially decaying vorticity field downstream of the bluff body in the shear layers. The length over which the decay occurs was shown to scale with the length of the recirculation zone of the bluff body. i.e. the length over which the velocity profile transitions from shear layer to wake.  The flame influences this decay process in two ways.  Gas expansion across the flame reduces the extent of shear by reducing the magnitude of negative velocities within the …,True,oY31AqwAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,17,https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/24823,15277829942048205292,/scholar?cites=15277829942048205292,,https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/24823/shanbhogue_santosh_j_200808_phd.pdf?origin%3Dpublication_detail%26sequence%3D1,0,0,0

The objective of this paper is to follow up on these observations and systematically characterize the blowoff phenomenology as a function of the H2 levels in the fuel.

A binary search is then performed until the global optimum is obtained with the desired accuracy.

1158053,A trust region method for the solution of the surrogate dual in integer programming,2015,Natashia Boland and Andrew C Eberhard and Angelos Tsoukalas,167,Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications,2,558-584,Springer US,We propose an algorithm for solving the surrogate dual of a mixed integer program. The algorithm uses a trust region method based on a piecewise affine model of the dual surrogate value function. A new and much more flexible way of updating bounds on the surrogate dual’s value is proposed. in which numerical experiments prove to be advantageous. A proof of convergence is given and numerical tests show that the method performance is better than a state of the art subgradient solver. Incorporation of the surrogate dual value as a cut added to the integer program is shown to greatly reduce solution times of a standard commercial solver on a specific class of problems.,True,xNufxZgAAAAJ:IRz6iEL74y4C,3,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-014-0681-9,5703537792985726594,/scholar?cites=5703537792985726594,,http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2014/02/4249.pdf,0,0,0

The operational tasks of such firms consists of first bidding for the project and. if successful in the bid. assigning employee resources to the project. In this paper we model this as a revenue management problem and develop a stochastic dynamic programming framework to aid the firm in their bidding and assignment process. We study this primarily under a quality-revelation model where the employees that would be assigned to the project are committed ex ante. as part of the bid. The win probability depends on the quoted price as well as the quality of the employees who would work on the project. We also consider a quality-reputation model where the bid’s win probability depends on past performance. say an average of the quality of past jobs. The problem is computationally challenging and we provide a series of bounds and solution methods to approximate the stochastic dynamic program. Based on our computational techniques we are able to address a number of interesting questions on utilization and the value of each employee type for a PSF. Our methodology provides management a toolkit for bidding on projects as well as to perform workforce analytics to determine optimal utilization levels and staffing decisions.,True,xNufxZgAAAAJ:cWzG1nlazyYC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3629128,,,,,0,0,0

Also. many of the investment decisions are poorly thought through or examined. Investments decision taken during the procurement phase often merely based on intuition and rough estimations of the future costs and risks. Also. many of the traditionally used appraisal approaches have been shown inadequate in anticipating the consequences of such an investment. As a result. the investment is too often assumed to be negative since the benefits are not proper evaluated. included and weighted against the costs and risks the investment is expected to generate. Poor decision-basis does not only affect the actual decision-making in a particular project but also. in the long run. the motivation to innovate and to introduce new ICT tools and working methods into the construction industry.

All over the world several thousand structures have been retrofitted using FRP. Buildings and civil structures usually have a very long life and it is not uncommon that the demands on the structure change with time. The structures may have to carry larger loads at a later date or fulfil new standards. In extreme cases. a structure may need repair due to an accident. or due to errors made during the design or construction phase. To guarantee the function of the strengthening properties. anchorage of the FRP is essential. Without sufficient anchorage lengths. full utilization of the strengthening material cannot be achieved. leading to possible premature failure. In this paper. experimental work and numerical analyses of three different Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) strengthening techniques have been carried out. The techniques are externally bonded plates. sheets and the use of Near Surface Mounted Reinforcement (NSMR). The aim is to find a critical anchorage length. where a longer anchorage length does not contribute to the load bearing capacity. Three different anchorage lengths have been investigated; 100. 200 and 500 mm. The finite element program ABAQUS has been used for the numerical study. The results show that a critical anchorage length exists for plates and sheets as well as for NSMR. However. the present study also shows that an exact critical anchorage length may be difficult to estimate. at least with the present test set-up.

Of the several approaches taken to assess emissions. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based methods do not just take into account the construction phase. but consider all phases of the life cycle of the construction. However. many current LCA approaches make general assumptions regarding location and effects. which do not do justice to the inherent dynamics of normal construction projects.

Predicting the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of excavators is therefore critical in order to mitigate the environmental impact of earthwork operations. However. there is a lack of method for estimating such energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. especially during the early planning stages of these activities. This research proposes a model using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict an excavator’s hourly energy consumption and CO 2 emissions under different site conditions. The proposed ANN model includes five input parameters: digging depth. cycle time. bucket payload. engine horsepower. and load factor. The Caterpillar handbook’s data. that included operational characteristics of twenty-five models of excavators. were used to develop the training and testing sets for the ANN model. The proposed ANN models were also designed to identify which factors from all the input parameters have the greatest impact on energy and emissions. based on partitioning weight analysis. The results showed that the proposed ANN models can provide an accurate estimating tool for the early planning stage to predict the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of excavators. Analyses have revealed that. within all the input parameters. cycle time has the greatest impact on energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The findings from the research enable the control of crucial factors which significantly impact on energy consumption and CO 2 emissions.

1158096,An indicator for superfluous iteration in offsite building design processes,2015,Martin Haller and Weizhuo Lu and Lars Stehn and Gustav Jansson,11,Architectural Engineering and Design Management,5,360-375,Taylor & Francis,Enhancement of iteration management in the design phase is important for successful offsite building projects. Design iteration has two aspects. Although iteration is necessary to deal with design requirements when solving complex problems (i.e. increasing quality through iteration). it has also been identified in numerous studies to be one of the main causes of design errors and time and cost overruns (i.e. superfluous iteration). as it increases scheduling and design complexity. Current building project management tools do not provide a means to control the reduction of superfluous iteration.

From 1990 to 2002. approximately 74% single-family detached houses in Sweden are prefabricated by industrialized housing builders. To fulfill the benefits of industrialization. the design specifications have to be worked out from a list of predefined standardized components and elements. On the other hand. the requirements of client (diversity. cost and delivery time) make design specification process seems to be complex and paradoxical situation. which may lead to the ad-hoc design customization and slow response to potential client’s enquiry. This research therefore presents a BIM-based configuration design. in which lean-agile supply chain is used to balance and manage the trade-off between builders and clients. standardization and customization. Furthermore. integrating discrete event simulation (DES) with building information model (BIM) enables an enriched information model including cost and delivery time. The research argues that the industrialized housing is the systematic trade-off and balancing the values of all stakeholders and BIM-based lean-agile industrialized configuration design provides an effective trade-off platform.,True,ldWB4vQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,10,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1000420,14220589482196236477,/scholar?cites=14220589482196236477,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1000420/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0
1158100,A practical method for assessing the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of mass haulers,2016,Hassanean SH Jassim and Weizhuo Lu and Thomas Olofsson,9,Energies,10,802,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Mass hauling operations play central roles in construction projects. They typically use many haulers that consume large amounts of energy and emit significant quantities of CO2. However. practical methods for estimating the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of such operations during the project planning stage are scarce. while most of the previous methods focus on construction stage or after the construction stages which limited the practical adoption of reduction strategy in the early planning phase. This paper presents a detailed model for estimating the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of mass haulers that integrates the mass hauling plan with a set of predictive equations. The mass hauling plan is generated using a planning program such as DynaRoad in conjunction with data on the productivity of selected haulers and the amount of material to be hauled during cutting. filling. borrowing. and disposal operations. This plan is then used as input for estimating the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the selected hauling fleet. The proposed model will help planners to assess the energy and environmental performance of mass hauling plans. and to select hauler and fleet configurations that will minimize these quantities. The model was applied in a case study. demonstrating that it can reliably predict energy consumption. CO2 emissions. and hauler productivity as functions of the hauling distance for individual haulers and entire hauling fleets.,True,ldWB4vQAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,9,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/10/802,2403209677003151188,/scholar?cites=2403209677003151188,,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/10/802/pdf,0,0,0

A predictive environmental assessment method enables a comparison of alternatives in construction operations to mitigate these environmental impacts. Process-based life cycle assessment (pLCA). which is the most widely applied environmental assessment method. requires lots of detailed process information to evaluate. However. a construction project usually operates in uncertain and dynamic project environments. and capturing such process information represents a critical challenge for pLCA. Discrete event simulation (DES) provides an opportunity to include uncertainty and capture the dynamic environments of construction operations. This study proposes a predictive assessment method that integrates DES and pLCA (DES-pLCA) to evaluate the environmental impact of on-site construction operations and supply chains. The DES feeds pLCA with process information that considers the uncertain and dynamic environments of construction. while pLCA guides the comprehensive procedure of environmental assessment. A DES-pLCA prototype was developed and implemented in a case study of an 18-storey building in Northeast China. The results showed that the biggest impact variations on the global warming potential (GWP). acidification potential (AP). eutrophication (EP). photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). abiotic depletion potential (ADP). and human toxicity potential (HTP) were 5.1%. 4.1%. 4.1%. 4.7%. 0.3%. and 5.9%. respectively. due to uncertain and dynamic factors.

To mitigate these impacts. contractors need to develop environmentally friendly plans that have optimal equipment. materials and labour configurations. However. construction plans with optimal environment may negatively affect the project cost and duration. resulting in dilemma for contractors on adopting low impacts plans. Moreover. the enumeration method that is usually used needs to assess and compare the performances of a great deal of scenarios. which seems to be time consuming for complicated projects with numerous scenarios. This study therefore developed an integrated method to efficiently provide contractors with plans having optimal environment–cost–time performances. Discrete-event simulation (DES) and particle swarm optimisation algorithms (PSO) are integrated through an iterative loop. which remarkably reduces the efforts on optimal scenarios searching. In the integrated method. the simulation module can model the construction equipment and materials consumption; the assessment module can evaluate multi-objective performances; and the optimisation module fast converges on optimal solutions. A prototype is developed and implemented in a hotel building construction. Results show that the proposed method greatly reduced the times of simulation compared with enumeration method. It provides the contractor with a trade-off solution that can average reduce 26.9% of environmental impact. 19.7% of construction cost. and 10.2% of project duration.

Construction practitioners and researchers have proposed approaches to maintain continuous flows. However. many of these approaches only consider deterministic activity durations or have some other methodological limitations. Accordingly. a continuous flow simulation model is presented in this paper in order to overcome aforementioned limitations. The proposed model integrates simulation and buffering to consider the probability of activities durations and for proper sizing of buffers. Instead of having the same activity duration distribution on different units as is common. the proposed model allows for different activity duration distribution between units. The proposed model is tested and validated on a case study and the results show that the model can provide practical contributions in scheduling that effectively maintain continuous flow for probability repetitive project.

Energy aspects are often not considered before the detailed design phase and a systematic way of analysing the energy performance of solutions throughout the design phase is lacking.

The case study provided qualitative insights into how the proposed framework can contribute to a more structured requirements management of a construction project with a focus on the energy-efficient design of buildings. It can be seen that the proposed framework for requirements management of energy performance provides a structure for designers to consider and apply energy performance criteria in the early design stages and visualize the consequences of alternative design solutions for clients. engineers. contractors and suppliers.

1158119,Design automation in construction: An overview,2016,Marcus Sandberg and Robert Gerth and Weizhuo Lu and Gustav Jansson and Jani Mukkavaara and Thomas Olofsson,,,,,,As the construction industry continues its digital journey the applications within design automation is growing. making development processes less time-demanding and more organized. Design automation applications can show design impact on eg cost. equipment availability. staff capabilities and buildability. It can also facilitate reuse of successful solutions instead of reinventing the wheel for every project. Thanks to automation it becomes easier to generate several solutions and trying different what-if-conditions. The field has many different approaches but an overview for construction where the connections between the different approaches are indicated is needed. The purpose of this paper is to describe our view of how the design automation fields of building information modelling. master models. knowledge-based engineering. configuration. modularization. platforms and simulation are connected and to provide input to the design automation discussion in construction. Each of these areas are introduced and then they are analyzed in relation to each other and presented as an overview.

1158120,An indicator for superfluous iteration in offsite building design processes,2015,Martin Haller and Weizhuo Lu and Lars Stehn and Gustav Jansson,11,Architectural Engineering and Design Management,5,360-375,Taylor & Francis,Enhancement of iteration management in the design phase is important for successful offsite building projects. Design iteration has two aspects. Although iteration is necessary to deal with design requirements when solving complex problems (i.e. increasing quality through iteration). it has also been identified in numerous studies to be one of the main causes of design errors and time and cost overruns (i.e. superfluous iteration). as it increases scheduling and design complexity. Current building project management tools do not provide a means to control the reduction of superfluous iteration. One problem is that existing research has difficulty precisely relating the effects of specific management actions to superfluous iteration. The idea of this study is to develop an indicator. the sequence deviation quotient (SDQ). which reflects the amount of superfluous design iteration in a project. It can be thought of as a tool …,True,WWk3f70AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,12,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17452007.2014.937793,4493647913410151370,/scholar?cites=4493647913410151370,,,0,0,0
1158121,Design process organisation at industrial house builders: a case study of two timber housing companies in Sweden,2008,Gustav Jansson and Erik Söderholm and Helena Johnsson,1,,,135-144,Association of Researchers in Construction Management,In industrial construction companies the design process tends to be the bottleneck for further streamlining of the entire manufacturing process. The demands posed on this particular design process are diverse; should feed the production process with data. should satisfy the client with documentation and should document the project for experience feedback. Further complications arise from the internal notion of being a manufacturing company opposed to the external view of the company being a traditional building firm. In this work. the design process at two industrial builders was studied in-depth. The two companies have chosen opposing strategies for their design departments; one have specialised functions where all projects pass and the other have more general designers who work in parallel with similar tasks. With the support from lean production theory. the consequences of these two strategies on succeeding with design of industrial built houses are analysed. The results show that increased specialisation is beneficial in daily work. but can pose a sensitive design process if key competences suddenly vanish.,True,WWk3f70AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,9,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1000708,3623873609750704347,/scholar?cites=3623873609750704347,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1000708/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0
1158122,Modularization in a housing platform for mass customization,2013,Gustav Jansson and Helena Johnsson and Patrik Jensen,,,,,,The problem of combining production efficiency with flexible product offers in housing design is well known. The platform concept is applied in housing to support design and production with predefined solutions. Modularization can be useful to meet both client demands on flexibility and production requirements on standardisation. To identify the module drivers in housing. ten projects at one off-site housing company were analysed. Furthermore. the cycle time for the modules was recorded. Client. design. purchasing. production and suppliers have different module drivers. When module drivers concur. modules are identified by; identifying clear and few interfaces. the availability of a supplier. and the cycle time for the design and production of the module in relation to the production pace. The results from the case study further show that fixed geometry on modules is a less successful concept than parameterised modules in housing. The ability to outsource technical solutions increased. when the module drivers were combined with a long term relationship with the supplier. Variant modules were successfully applied in the studied company to respond to client demands. Further research is needed on how to configure generic modules.,True,WWk3f70AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1012960,6003631549565195721,/scholar?cites=6003631549565195721,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1012960/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

The aim of this research is to explore how the architectural design process contributes to the industrialised house-building industry from the perspective of creative design work. It also aims to describe how constraints affect architectural design work in the engineer-to-order context. when using platform-based production systems. Architects with experience in using platform-based building systems with different degrees of constraints were interviewed regarding creative aspects of the design work. The interviews. together with documents relating to platform constraints. were then analysed from the perspective of artistic and engineering design theories. The results show the benefits and issues of using platform constraints. both with prefabrication of volumetric modules. as well as prefabricated slab and wall elements. The study highlights a major research gap by describing how architectural work. from both the creative artistic and engineering design perspectives. is affected by constraints in the building platform:(1) the architectural design work goes through a series of divergent and convergent processes where the divergent processes are explorative and the convergent processes are solution-oriented; and (2). there is a trade-off between creativity and efficiency in the design work. Open parameters for layout design are key to architectural creativity. while predefinition supports efficiency.

1158125,Structuring information from BIM: A glance at bills of materials,2018,Jani Mukkavaara and Gustav Jansson and Thomas Olofsson,35,,,362-368,IAARC Publications,Industrialized house-builders are moving towards an enhanced production where management of information along the value chain is critical in order to deliver housing projects on time and with the desired quality. Today digital tools and systems are used in both design and production to produce. deliver and instruct actors throughout the phases of a project. However. the information usually exists in different islands and manual transfers are required to keep the flow of information between IT-systems and individuals continuous. A key to improving the ability for the members in different stages of a project to work with the same information is to facilitate different views. One of the building blocks for creating bridges between the islands of information is to introduce bills of materials which can be used to organize information for different purposes. Uniting the use of building information modeling (BIM) with bills of materials (BOM) is therefore our focus in this paper. This is done in the context of industrialized house-building and the facets which it brings to the subject. The aim of this paper is to present an early endeavor into a BOM based approach for structuring information from BIM models. A demonstration tool was developed. and together with application in a case project from an industrialized house-builder. the generation of BOMs from BIM data is illustrated and discussed. The findings illustrates that we can apply different structures to the information located in our BIM models and that we can produce a BOM perspective on our products.

Construction industry suffers from low efficiency in design. and the information flow creating bottlenecks for the production process. Tracing and managing information through design process needs standards both for requirements and Building Information Models in a life cycle perspective. Structuring functional requirements is of great interest for the construction industry and especially for companies developing industrialised housing system that often have control over the whole manufacturing process. The delivery of a new low-carbon economy in Europe puts pressure on the construction industry to reduce the energy consumption for buildings. Therefore is one national standard for energy requirements tested on a building system and evaluated in an Information and Communication Technology–environment (ICT) that supports the design process for industrialised construction. The result of the research shows that the transformation of requirements to technical solutions needs functionality that supports the design process by using standards for requirements.

A longitudinal comparison between implemented energy conservation key policy instruments in Sweden and Germany and a survey regarding the management of energy requirements in the building process shows that:–No evidence is found that energy consumption is of great importance for producing competitive offers. either for Swedish or German clients.–The Swedish market-driven policy has not been as successful as the German regulation policy in decreasing the energy consumption of new buildings.–Building standards and regulations regarding energy performance affects how professionals …No evidence is found that energy consumption is of great importance for producing competitive offers. either for Swedish or German clients.The Swedish market-driven policy has not been as successful as the German regulation policy in decreasing the energy consumption of new buildings.Building standards and regulations regarding energy performance affects how professionals …,True,mQSbPkAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,27,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513000992,9151417282447712749,/scholar?cites=9151417282447712749,,,0,0,0
1158139,Evaluation of forecasting techniques and forecast errors: with focus on intermittent demand,2009,Peter Wallström,,,,,,To decide in advance the amount of resources that is required next week or next month can be both a complicated and hazardous task depending on the situation. despite the known time frame when the resources are needed. Intermittent demand. or slow-moving demand. that is when there are time periods without demand and then suddenly a time period with demand. becomes even more difficult to forecast. If the demand is underestimated it will lead to lost sales and therefore lost revenues. If the demand is overestimated. in the best case the stock is increased or in worst case. the items lie unsold until they become obsolete. The items with intermittent demand can have a value of up to 60% of the total stock value for all items.This thesis addresses the topic of forecasting intermittent demand and how to measure the accuracy of the chosen forecast method or methods. Four forecasting methods are tested on almost 18 months of empirical demand data from a manufacturing company. The tested forecasting methods are single exponential smoothing. Croston and two modification of the Croston method. one by Syntetos and Boylan the other by Segerstedt (modified Croston). Four start values and eight smoothing constants are tested.,True,mQSbPkAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,12,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:990519,5053242722785945931,/scholar?cites=5053242722785945931,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:990519/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

In addition. it is illustrated how four case companies work with waste and value within a lean context. The literature review revealed that there have been significantly more frequent and exhaustive discussions of waste than of value. Waste is often related to the seven wastes. but value is rarely clearly defined. The cases show an exclusive focus on waste reduction. which we argue can result in a loss of value.,True,mQSbPkAAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,6,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1047614,6045898223717125029,/scholar?cites=6045898223717125029,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1047614/FULLTEXT02,0,0,0

Denna ineffektivitet leder till att bygginvesteringar resulterar i onödigt mycket resurser i anspråk. vilket resulterar i högre kostnader för kunderna. Slöseri är ytterligare ett problem. Bristfällig planering av materialstyrning och produktion gör att byggprojekt blir mycket dyrare än nödvändigt.Genom att kunna mäta ett byggprojekt kvantitativt med högre upplösning (aktivitetsnivå) än vad som görs idag kan stora summor sparas i form av inlärningseffekter och styrning då det är möjligt att identifiera operativa förbättringar. Operativa detaljer påverkar strategier och kan ge betydande konkurrensfördelar.

1158147,The Interaction of Contractor’s Cost Flow with Operational Practice: A Simulation Study,2013,Peter Wallström and Weizhuo Lu and Thomas Olofsson,,,,,,The construction companies are struggling for cost control in construction projects. This is often based on cost estimation of scheduled activities. A project may fail due to lack of cash even if it is profitable. The cash flow presents dynamic characteristic which is changing with time progress and it is influenced by the uncertainty project environment. such as supply chain variation. equipment failure and the deviation of working efficiency. At the same time. the increasing market competition forces these companies to transfer from the traditional practice to more advanced and efficient practices. such as lean or flexible production. However. to use lean or flexible production might not prove successful unless the practices are introduced in the right environment. The resources are used in a very efficient way concerning lean. but the practice demand a high degree of predictability. The opposite is true for a flexible production. The resources are not used as efficient but can then on the other hand handle variation better than lean. The research is based on the question: How does managerial operational practices and variation in production influence the cash flow? A model is proposed to simulate and forecast the cash flow considering the uncertainty project environment and selected operational practice. A case study including six scenarios (high and low variation. three operation practices) is used to illustrate the proposed model. A conclusion is that it is important to consider both managerial aspects as well as operational aspects in order to avoid sub-optimization in production.

The current sales and design process at a timber volume element prefabricator is presented and evaluated regarding information management and standardisation. It was found that information management during early design is often ad hoc and person dependent; therefore searching for information that could lead to reuse of past solutions is rather time demanding. There is a need for standardisation due to a mentality of designing one-of-a-kind buildings. Knowledge-based engineering is seen as an enabler to enhance the current situation and an IT support procedure is suggested. A demonstrator stair tool was tested. which lets the seller discuss needs with the customer and then use the tool to assess cost and manufacturability. It is argued that the IT support procedure can enable; automation of activities and availability of down stream knowledge in virtual format and a connection between instances of the same geometry. If design flaws can be found early on. downstream waste activities can be reduced. Standardisation could be realised through modularisation. which the implementation of the IT support tool procedure could gain from.,True,yL7WpksAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,42,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:889468,2855863822402790070,/scholar?cites=2855863822402790070,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:889468/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Optimization methods are at hand. but the question is how to connect and coordinate the updating of the domain models of each discipline and centralize the product definition into one source instead of having several unconnected product definitions. Building information modelling (BIM) features the idea of centralizing the product definition to a BIM-model and creating interoperability between models from different domains and previous research reports on different applications in a number of fields within construction. Recent research features BIM-based optimization. but there is still a question of knowing how to design a BIM-based process using neutral file formats to enable multidisciplinary optimization of life-cycle energy and cost. This paper proposes a framework for neutral BIM-based multidisciplinary optimization. The framework consists of (1) a centralized master model. from which different discipline-specific domain models are generated and evaluated; and (2) an optimization algorithm controlling the optimization loop.

Although the engine systems development process of the next generation aero engines takes place at the original equipment manufacturer level. component manufacturers need to optimize their components using an integrated engine system design approach. Therefore. they need the capability to model and simulate whole engine behavior. While modeling and simulation are traditional strengths of the aerospace industry. model integration of the whole engine system and its components. as well as between separate disciplines. is still a relatively weak link. This paper presents a master-model approach that facilitates integrated analysis used in design optimization. The master-model approach promotes the existence of a single governing version of the product definition. including associated versions of loads. materials. interfaces. constraints etc. A simple yet illustrative industry application is presented where dynamics and displacement analysis are performed using the master model and a parameter study is performed to find an optimal design. The presented scenario investigates the impact of changing the bearing position of the turbine rear frame of a turbo-fan engine considering the load case of a “fan blade off” event. 2.

Today design and computational engineers often are far from integrated. The design tool in this paper couples the simulation of distortion effects due to machining with CAD. where knowledge of how to perform a machining simulation is captured within the tool. The tool system is governed by a UNIX shell script and uses Python scripts for pre-and post-processing purposes coupled to the finite element software MSC. Marc™. The tool allows an engineer to estimate the distortion effects due to machining and is believed to help bridge the gap between design and computational engineers in the manufacturing planning stages of engineering design. By using tools like the one presented here. both component quality and accuracy of machining operation cost estimation can be expected to increase. since distortion problems can be solved or prevented already in the manufacturing planning stages of engineering design.

The rationale for developing and implementing methods for experience feedback is well documented. and regardless of the choice of production strategy common denominators are needs to recognise defects and to apply a continuous quality improvement program that incorporates learning from mistakes. The purpose of this paper is to present ongoing work regarding experience feedback. with the ultimate aim to close the feedback loops in off-site housing sales. design and production. An indoor production process at a Swedish housing company is probed. The investigated company utilises off-site module manufacturing. a production form with a 15% market share among professional clients in Sweden (recurrent clients purchasing commercial and multi-storey buildings). This production form appears to be well-suited for implementing experience feedback. since control is already required in the production process. Based on a literature review and case examples a model for experience feedback is proposed. The feedback model is executed in a logical control structure with four levels:(1) plan and learn.(2) capture and assign to targets.(3) analyse and prioritise. solve and assess.(4) implement and use feedback.

1158169,A modelling methodology for assessing use of datacenter waste heat in greenhouses,2017,Marcus Sandberg and Mikael Risberg and Anna-Lena Ljung and Damiano Varagnolo and Damiano Xiong and Michael Nilsson,,,,,,In Sweden. the number of datacenters establishments are steadily increasing thanks to green. stable and affordable electricity. free air cooling. advantageous energy taxes and well-developed Internet fiber infrastructures. Even though datacenters use a lot of energy. the waste heat that they create is seldom reused. A possible cause is that this waste heat is often low grade and airborne: it is therefore hard to directly inject it into a district heating system without upgrades. which require additional energy and equipment that generate extra costs. One option for reusing this heat without needs for upgrades is to employ it for heating up greenhouses. But assessing the feasibility of this approach by building physical prototypes can be costly. therefore using computer models to simulate real world conditions is an opportunity. However. there is a lack of computer modelling methodologies that can assess the possibility of using waste heat from datacenters in greenhouses in cold climates.The objective of this paper is therefore to propose such a methodology and discuss its benefits and drawbacks in comparison with other research studies. This methodology combines computational fluid dynamics. process modelling and control engineering principles into a computer model that constitutes a decision support system to study different waste heat and greenhouse or mushroom house scenarios.,True,yL7WpksAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,4,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1155483,7350341199863037462,/scholar?cites=7350341199863037462,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1155483/FULLTEXT02,0,0,0

The significant benefit of CHP is its overall efficiency. which can be as much as 85–90%. One of the most promising targets in the application of CHP lies in energy production for buildings. The most important competing technologies in this regard are reciprocating engines. micro-turbines. Stirling engines. and fuel cells. The benefit of these technologies is their ability to utilize sustainable fuels. like regenerative biomass. which makes them attractive. In spite of many technical and economic obstacles limiting the availability and feasibility of these technologies at the moment. the literature is optimistic about their future. The breakthrough of new technology is often regarded simply as a matter of decision-making.This article is a general review of …,True,dPgrVjAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,245,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032104000036,8157174773830647810,/scholar?cites=8157174773830647810,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.211.6726&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Conventional windows tend to have poor glazing properties. which causes significant heat loss during the winter season and undesirable heat gain during the summer season. Advanced window technologies are therefore required to mitigate the energy consumption of buildings. The key hypothesis in this study is that advanced windows become economically viable for end-users if the difference in life-cycle cost between advanced window types and the state-of-the-art (reference) window is equal to zero. To verify this hypothesis. we calculate the allowable additional investment costs (dIC) for three types of advanced windows over a given life span. Different advanced windows; electrochromic.

The challenge is to identify such a combination of design options that result in minimum life cycle cost (LCC) and maximum exergy efficiency (EE) at each phase of the transition path. In this paper. a time-effective multi-objective optimization method based on genetic algorithm (GA). is proposed for the transition path problem. The proposed model makes use of a fitness function approach to reduce the model into one objective function and to reduce the computational time. In a case study. the model is applied to a potential net-zero exergy district (NZEXD) in Hangzhou. China.

The goal of this project was to calculate the environmental releases for a whole office building and investigate the contribution in terms of environmental impact for different parts of the building. as well as the impact from different stages of the life cycle. The construction process was followed up during production and the contractors provided real-time data on the input required in terms of building products. transport. machinery. energy use. etc. The results are presented for five environmental impact categories and. as expected. materials that constitute the main mass of the building and the energy used during operation contribute the largest share of environmental impact. It is usually difficult to evaluate the environmental impact of the materials in technical installations due to the lack of data. However. in this study. the data were provided by the contractors directly involved in the construction and can. therefore. be considered highly reliable.

A significant share of the climate impacts can be attributed to the construction sector and specifically to cement production. Thus. one of several mitigation strategies is to identify commonly used materials with high climate impacts (during their extraction. service life and disposal) and replace them with biobased materials in construction. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to demonstrate the climate benefits of such a shift. but forest complexities create uncertainty as LCA practitioners traditionally omit certain key aspects.This thesis is based upon studies designed to enhance understanding of the effects of increasing use of biobased materials in climate change mitigation of construction works with a life cycle perspective. Research questions were formulated focusing on identifying nontraditional LCA methodology aspects and assessing the climate impact effects of increasing the use of biobased materials while accounting for these aspects.

An increased proportion of biobased building materials in construction is a potential measure to reduce these emissions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has often been applied to compare the climate impact from biobased materials with that from eg mineral based materials. mostly favouring biobased materials.

1158222,Future scenarios for climate change mitigation of new building construction in Sweden: Effects of different technological pathways,2017,Diego Peñaloza,,,,,,Climate mitigation strategies are required with urgency. The Swedish construction sector contributes to a significant share of the country’s yearly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A variety of alternative climate mitigation strategies is available aimed to different processes and activities related to production and operation of buildings. Several studies evaluating the effectiveness of these strategies have been performed at the building stock level. These studies however do not consider the technological change in manufacturing of building materials. The objective of this study is to evaluate the climate change mitigation effects of increasing the use of biobased materials in the construction of new residential buildings in Sweden under different scenarios related to technological change in material manufacturing. For this. the climate impact from Swedish new buildings has been assessed for the coming one hundred years using a model that combines scenario analysis based on official statistics and life cycle assessment of seven different building typologies. Eight different scenarios for increased use of low-impact building typologies such as timber buildings and low-impact concrete are explored under different pathways for growth of their market share and changes in energy production.

1158225,Environmental considerations for biobased materials in modern methods of construction,2014,Dennis Jones and Diego Peñaloza,,Performance and maintenance of bio-‐based building materials influencing the life cycle and LCA,,11,,The construction sector is constantly looking to improve building performance through efficient design. better construction practices(either through onsite or offsite construction) and the use of innovative materials. Often the innovation is a result of the‘marriage’of different materials that were previously used in stand-‐alone applications. A good example of high performance materials. but not necessarily of biobased materials. is the manufacture of structural insulated panels (SIPS). These combine materials with high insulative properties (such as polyurethane foams) with composite materials and aluminium foils. Whilst much of the drive for development is as a direct response to governmental legislature. the desire by construction companies to stay ‘one step ahead’of rivals and the increasing understanding of the general public of environmental and sustainability concerns. In order to make informed judgements and to provide impartial guidance. it has been necessary to compile a range of assessment tools to critically evaluate materials and building design. Over the first years of many of these assessment tools. emphasis was placed on using a range of synthetic materials. as they were perceived as providing better results. However. the past few years has seen a considerable increase in interest towards biobased materials. so combining performance with environmental considerations and life cycle aspects.In terms of sustainability. one of the key factors that has grasped public imagination has been the reduction in the carbon footprint of new buildings. as well as gradual improvement of refurbished stock.

Combustion of torrefied biomass can alleviate such issues. as it contains less chlorine than its raw biomass precursor. This work assessed the effect of the furnace temperature on the chlorine content of generated torrefied biomass and the released gaseous species during the torrefaction process (a mild pyrolysis). The selected biomass was corn straw. which was torrefied at furnace temperatures in the range of 250–400 °C under atmospheric pressure in an inert nitrogen flow.

This year’s manuscript will investigate whether there are possibilities of taking advantage of such very different combustion behaviors to curtail emissions of pollutants from burning blended fuels. Given that sulfur contents of coals vary broadly. this work explored whether co-firing of high-sulfur coals with lowsulfur coals of different ranks has any distinct advantages on lowering the sulfur dioxide emissions of the former coals. beyond those predicted based on the mixing proportions. On the other hand. given that the nitrogen contents of coals vary narrowly. this work also explored whether co-firing of coals can influence the fuel-bound nitrogen evolution mechanism to disfavor formation of nitrogen oxides. This study included high-sulfur bituminous coals (such as Illinois# 6) and low-sulfur lignite coals (such as Beulah). Both of these coals have comparable nitrogen contents.

This research investigated the emissions of hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas from combustion of biomass in a fixed bed. as functions of the mass air flow rate through the bed and of the moisture content of the fuel. The biomass burned was corn straw. either raw or torrefied. Results showed that increasing the air flow rate through the bed increased the release of HCl gas. as a result of enhanced combustion intensity and associated enhanced heat release rates. When the airflow through the bed was increased by a factor of six. the amount of fuel-bound chlorine converted to HCl nearly tripled. Upon completion of combustion. most of the chlorine remained in the biomass ashes. with the exception of the highest air flow case where the fraction of chlorine released in HCl equaled that captured in the ashes.

Both biomass species were torrefied at 275 C for 30 minutes. Moreover. both samples were pulverized and sieved to the size range of 160-200 µm. Single particles of the two biomass samples. both raw and torrefied. were then injected into an electrically-heated droptube furnace. heated to 1400 K. Their combustion behavior in air was observed with highresolution. high-speed cinematography. The particles ignited very close to the injector tip at the top of the drop-tube furnace. immediately upon entering the radiation zone. Upon ignition. the volatile matter flames surrounding individual particles grew bigger and became increasingly luminous. For all samples. these envelope flames had spherical shapes. The volatile matter flames of torrefied biomass particles appeared to be more luminous than the flames of raw biomass samples. Particles of these biomass samples have initially needle-like shapes. However. partial softening/melting during devolatilization inside the high-temperature envelope flames shrunk and spherodized the ensuing char particles.

This year’s manuscript will investigate whether there are possibilities of taking advantage of such very different combustion behaviors to curtail emissions of pollutants from burning blended fuels. Given that sulfur contents of coals vary broadly. this work explored whether co-firing of high-sulfur coals with lowsulfur coals of different ranks has any distinct advantages on lowering the sulfur dioxide emissions of the former coals. beyond those predicted based on the mixing proportions. On the other hand. given that the nitrogen contents of coals vary narrowly. this work also explored whether co-firing of coals can influence the fuel-bound nitrogen evolution mechanism to disfavor formation of nitrogen oxides. This study included high-sulfur bituminous coals (such as Illinois# 6) and low-sulfur lignite coals (such as Beulah). Both of these coals have comparable nitrogen contents. However. they dramatically differ in combustion behaviors. as the bituminous coal burns for comparatively longer times in twostage combustion (volatile flames and char oxidation). whereas the lignite coal undergoes extensive bulk fragmentation and. thereafter. burns expediently.,True,obJXZJsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,11,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emad_Rokni/publication/309230751_Emissions_from_cofirng_coals/links/5806251b08aeb85ac85f1736/Emissions-from-cofirng-coals.pdf,7929928690848515224,/scholar?cites=7929928690848515224,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emad_Rokni/publication/309230751_Emissions_from_cofirng_coals/links/5806251b08aeb85ac85f1736/Emissions-from-cofirng-coals.pdf,0,0,0

Hence. the purpose of this work is to theoretically examine the effects of (a) the oxygen concentration in the O2/CO2 gases. and (b) the resulting combustion temperatures. on the evolution of NOx. To achieve these goals a previously published kinetic model was used. which assumes that fuel-bound nitrogen is released along with the tars during coal devolatilization and converts mostly to hydrogen cyanide.

1158322,Fundamental Study of Spray and Partially Premixed Combustion of Methane/Air Mixture,,Siamak Kazemzadeh and Ali Moghaddas and Reza Ebrahimi and Hadis Hemmati,,,,,,This study presents fundamentals of spray and partially premixed combustion characteristics of directly injected methane in a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC). The constant volume vessel is a cylinder with inside diameter of 135 mm and inside height of 135 mm. Two end of the vessel are equipped with optical windows. A high speed complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera capable of capturing pictures up to 40.000 frames per second is used to observe flow conditions inside the chamber. The injected fuel jet generates turbulence in the vessel and forms a turbulent heterogeneous fuel–air mixture in the vessel. similar to that in a compressed natural gas (CNG) directinjection (DI) engine. The fuel–air mixture is ignited by centrally located electrodes at a given spark delay timing of 1. 40. 75. and 110 ms. In addition to the four delay times. a 5min waiting period was used in order to make sure of having laminar homogeneous combustion. Spray development and characterization including spray tip penetration (STP). spray cone angle (SCA). and overall equivalence ratio were investigated under 30–90 bar fuel pressures and 1–5 bar chamber pressure. Flame propagation images and combustion characteristics were determined via pressure-derived parameters and analyzed at a fuel pressure of 90 bar and a chamber pressure of 1 bar at different stratification ratios (SR)(from 0% to 100%) at overall equivalence ratios of 0.6. 0.8. and 1.0.

A generalized mathematical formulation is presented here that allows including nonlinear constraints in non-local equilibrium systems characterized by the existence of a non-increasing Lyapunov functional under the system’s internal dynamics. The generalized formulation of RCCE enables to clarify the essentials of the method and the built-in general feature of thermodynamic consistency in the chemical kinetics context. In this paper. we work out the details of the method in a generalized mathematical-physics framework. but for definiteness we detail its well-known implementation in the traditional chemical kinetics framework. We detail proofs and spell out explicit functional dependences so as to bring out and clarify each underlying assumption of the method. In the standard context of chemical kinetics of ideal gas mixtures. we discuss the relations between the validity of the detailed balance condition off-equilibrium and the thermodynamic consistency of the method. We also discuss two examples of RCCE gas-phase combustion calculations to emphasize the constraint-dependent performance of the RCCE method.

The theoretical results have been compared with experimental measurement of light intensity profiles across the flame front using commercially available image processing software. These results are in good agreement. The theory predicts that the sudden change of light intensity from dark to bright does not coincide with the flame edge unless the flame thickness is negligible.

Gas Turbines Power,4,1075-1080,,Energy and exergy analyses have been performed on a pulse detonation engine. A pulse detonation engine is a promising new engine. which uses a detonation wave instead of a deflagration wave for the combustion process. The high-speed supersonic combustion wave reduces overall combustion duration resulting in an nearly constant volume energy release process compared to the constant pressure process of gas turbine engines.

However. as reactants themselves. H2O2 and Fe2+ can act as ·OH initiators as well as ·OH scavengers. leading to the need for a high dosage of reactants and increased costs. As a mixing-sensitive reaction. the ·OH-related reaction kinetics (·OH with Fe2+.

As an important factor impacting thermal conversion. changes in the burning rate follow variations in corn length. which then affect gas emissions. As a result of insufficient knowledge concerning the mechanisms of complex combustion. the development of a combustion system has been restricted. Modeling of this combustion system will complement experimental data; however. improving such a model is challenging as a result of the unique characteristics of corn. such as its moisture content and porosity. The results show that corn straw with a shorter length has a shorter ignition time. increased bed temperature. and reduced amounts of unburned carbon in the ash residues.

The regeneration of Fe2+ was facilitated by the consumption of NH2OH. while in hydroquinone (HQ)- and 1.4-bezoquinone (1.4-BQ)-modified Fenton systems. the quinone cycle could be built up and Fe3+ could be converted to Fe2+ continuously. However. results showed that HQ and 1.4-BQ reacted with ·OH. which caused a gradual decline in the enhancement effect.

Herein. we report a simple but effective electrochemical modification of reticulated vitreous carbon foam (RVC foam) electrode for enhanced H 2 O 2 electrogeneration. Cyclic voltammetry. chronoamperometry. and X-ray photoelectron spectrum were used to characterize the modified electrode. Oxygen-containing groups (72.5–184.0 μmol/g) were introduced to RVC foam surface. thus resulting in a 59.8–258.2% higher H 2 O 2 yield. The modified electrodes showed much higher electrocatalytic activity toward O 2 reduction and good stability.

Due to complex solid combustion mechanisms and inadequate knowledge of the process. the development of such combustion system is limited. Numerical modelling of this combustion system has some advantages over experimental analysis. although the development of a complete model for this type of combustion system remains a challenge. Due to its characteristic properties. modelling of biomass combustion has to overcome many difficulties.

Compared with a conventional “submerged” cathode. the H2O2 concentration obtained using the “floating” cathode is 4.3 and 1.5 times higher using porous graphite felt (GF) and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) foam electrodes. respectively. This surprising enhancement results from the formation of a three-phase interface inside the porous cathode. where the O2 from ambient air is also utilized for H2O2 production.

H2O2 concentration at steady-state is 99.5% higher under pulsed current of “2sON + 2sOFF” than under constant current when using reticulated vitreous carbon foam (RVC foam) cathode. This was caused by the facilitated H2O2 diffusion from the porous cathode to bulk as H2O2 electroreduction pathway was weakened. Additionally. the enhancement effect is more significant for RVC foam with low PPI. This strategy is also applicable to graphite felt (GF) cathode. in which a 56.0% higher H2O2 concentration was observed at steady-state under pulsed current of “2sON + 2sOFF”.

Croatia,Due to the outstanding properties of 2D and 3D textile composites. the use of 3D fiber reinforced in high-tech industrial domains (spatial. aeronautic. automotive. naval. etc…) has been expanded in recent years. Thus. the evaluation of their elastic properties is crucial for the use of such types of composites in advanced industries. The analytical or numerical modeling of textile composites in order to evaluate their elastic properties depend on the prediction of the elastic properties of unidirectional composite materials with long fibers composites “UD”. UD composites represent the basic element in modeling all laminates or 2D or 3D fabrics. They are considered as transversely isotropic materials composed of two phases: the reinforcement phase and the matrix phase. Isotropic fibers (eg glass fibers) or anisotropic fibers (eg carbon fibers) represent the reinforcement phase while. in general. isotropic materials (eg epoxy. ceramics. etc…) represent the matrix phase (Figure 1).The effective stiffness and compliance matrices of a transversely isotropic material are defined in the elastic regime by five independent engineering constants: longitudinal and transversal Young’s moduli E11 and E22. longitudinal and transversal shear moduli G12 and G23. and major Poisson’s ratio ν12 (Noting that direction 1 is along the fiber). The minor Poisson’s ratio ν23 is related to E22 and G12. The effective elastic properties are evaluated in terms of mechanical properties of fibers and matrix (Young’s and shear moduli. Poisson’s ratios and the fiber volume fraction Vf).

1158462,Comparative Review Study on Elastic Properties Modeling for Unidirectional Composite Materials,2012,Rafic Younes and Hallal Ali and Farouk Fardoun and Fadi Hajj Chehade,,,,,Intech Open Access Publisher,Due to the outstanding properties of 2D and 3D textile composites. the use of 3D fiber reinforced in high-tech industrial domains (spatial. aeronautic. automotive. naval. etc…) has been expanded in recent years. Thus. the evaluation of their elastic properties is crucial for the use of such types of composites in advanced industries. The analytical or numerical modeling of textile composites in order to evaluate their elastic properties depend on the prediction of the elastic properties of unidirectional composite materials with long fibers composites “UD”. UD composites represent the basic element in modeling all laminates or 2D or 3D fabrics. They are considered as transversely isotropic materials composed of two phases: the reinforcement phase and the matrix phase. Isotropic fibers (eg glass fibers) or anisotropic fibers (eg carbon fibers) represent the reinforcement phase while. in general. isotropic materials (eg epoxy. ceramics. etc…) represent the matrix phase (Figure 1).The effective stiffness and compliance matrices of a transversely isotropic material are defined in the elastic regime by five independent engineering constants: longitudinal and transversal Young’s moduli E11 and E22. longitudinal and transversal shear moduli G12 and G23. and major Poisson’s ratio ν12 (Noting that direction 1 is along the fiber). The minor Poisson’s ratio ν23 is related to E22 and G12. The effective elastic properties are evaluated in terms of mechanical properties of fibers and matrix (Young’s and shear moduli. Poisson’s ratios and the fiber volume fraction Vf).

1158471,A constraint-handling technique for genetic algorithms using a violation factor,2016,Adam Chehouri and Rafic Younes and Jean Perron and Adrian Ilinca,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.00976,,,,Over the years. several meta-heuristic algorithms were proposed and are now emerging as common methods for constrained optimization problems. Among them. genetic algorithms (GA's) shine as popular evolutionary algorithms (EA's) in engineering optimization. Most engineering design problems are difficult to resolve with conventional optimization algorithms because they are highly nonlinear and contain constraints. In order to handle these constraints. the most common technique is to apply penalty functions. The major drawback is that they require tuning of parameters. which can be very challenging. In this paper. we present a constraint-handling technique for GA's solely using the violation factor. called VCH (Violation Constraint-Handling) method. Several benchmark problems from the literature are examined. The VCH technique was able to provide a consistent performance and match results from other GA-based techniques.,True,JyiFKagAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C,49,https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00976,12009589973336287205,/scholar?cites=12009589973336287205,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00976,0,0,0

This describes a real modelling for the case of ports in contrary to the problems of unbounded domains. It involves the application of a partial reflection boundary condition for this sidewall. In fact. the partial reflection problem in practical application is of great importance in the design of a harbour or breakwater and mainly for short waves. The reflection coefficient of the harbour boundary (sidewall) plays an important role in modifying the performance of the floating breakwater. Moreover. it reduces the resonant peaks appearing inside the ports due to the energy accumulation in an enclosed domain.

1158493,Heat conduction in nanofluids,2009,Liqiu Wang and Xiaohao Wei,39,"Chaos, Solitons & Fractals",5,2211-2215,Pergamon,We show that macroscale heat conduction in nanofluids is of a dual-phase-lagging type rather than the Fourier type. This leads to models for effective thermal capacity. conductivity and diffusivity of nanofluids and reveals even more anomalous thermal behavior of nanofluids than those reported in the literature. Due to the coupled conduction of the two phases. thermal waves and possibly resonance may appear in nanofluid heat conduction. Such waves and resonance are responsible for the extraordinary conductivity enhancement.

This is associated with a specific role of the silica matrix. which facilitates the diffusion of the reacting cations. enhancing the ferric oxide formation. γ- to α- and/or ε-Fe2O3 transformations take place by increasing the Fe2O3 concentration for samples sintering at constant-heat treatment temperature. The dried monolith gel materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). as well as by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

In this context. an attempt has been made to determine the suitability of groundwater in Yarmouk Basin (YB) in Jordan for drinking purposes using the weighted arithmetic water quality index (WQI) approach with the respect to the Jordanian standards for drinking water. Groundwater quality records from 15 sampling stations spread across YB during 2008-2015 are used. Seven physical and chemical parameters are selected to calculate WQI. These parameters are pH. total dissolved solid (TDS). total hardness (TH). sulphates (SO4− 2). chlorides (Cl−). nitrates (NO3−). and sodium (Na+). The relationship between the selected groundwater quality parameters is evaluated using the correlation coefficient. A strong relationship is found between several parameters such as Cl− with Na+.

L'isolation thermique dans le bâtiment est nécessaire afin d'améliorer son efficacité énergétique. Dans certains pays dont la France. la rénovation des bâtiments occupe une place essentielle dans la stratégie de transition énergétique. La stratégie mise en place consiste donc à renforcer l'isolation thermique des enveloppes de bâtiment et ceci en perdant le moins de surface habitable possible. Ceci justifie le fait de développer et de mettre en œuvre à l'avenir des matériaux super isolants comme les aérogels. Les objectifs de cette étude sont d'examiner le comportement thermique des bâtiments et d'étudier l'amélioration possible de leur efficacité énergétique en utilisant un nouvel enduit isolant à base d'aérogels de silice et ainsi que l'énergie solaire. Tout d'abord. la performance thermique et hygrothermique des murs extérieurs est étudiée afin de trouver la meilleure structure de ces murs. Deuxièmement. nous étudions l'évolution du confort thermique et du comportement énergétique des maisons en adoptant le nouvel enduit isolant comme isolation extérieure. Cette évolution a aussi été représentée par un modèle mathématique. On a comparé les résultats obtenus à l'aide de ces modèles avec les mesures expérimentales faites sur une maison récemment construite. Enfin. le potentiel de réduction de la charge de chauffage en adoptant un système actif dans la paroi est analysé.

Convection heat fluxes were obtained using an inverse heat transfer method. Tests were performed at a nearly constant system pressure of 600 kPa and under saturated conditions. Local heat transfer coefficients were determined as a function of vapor quality along the length of the test section.

1158557,From Pinch Methodology to Pinch-Exergy Integration of Flexible Systems,2017,Assaad Zoughaib,,,,,Elsevier,Current changes to the energy market. as well as an ambition to achieve decarbonation and highly energy efficient systems. will lead to a fundamental change in the way in which energy systems are designed and managed. In particular. the growth of renewable and renewed energy will introduce a level of design and management complexity with a greater need for efficient energy storage. Beginning with the earliest methodologies (pinch). this book explores the methodology and tools necessary for the design of flexible energy efficient systems. In addition to studying the related literature. the author details original developments where exergy consumption is introduced as an objective function to minimize in mathematical programming models for both continuous and batch processes.

In order to ensure the energy systems transition towards a sustainable functioning mode while avoiding early depletion of energy resources. industrial activities need to foster process improvement. Among energy efficient process design methodologies. pinch analysis and exergy analysis are two powerful methods but each one shows drawbacks. This paper introduces a new methodology that uses the Jacobian Matrix of exergy destruction as a mathematical indicator to couple the Pinch and the exergy analysis and overcome their individual limitations. In the proposed approach. exergy analysis is used not only to assess the exergy losses but also to guide the changes needed in industrial processes structures and operating conditions.

They are identified as a very efficient way to reduce primary energy consumption in processes. especially in food & drink or pulp & paper industries. Nevertheless. the optimal integration of multiple heat pumps in a large process with numerous heat fluxes is challenging. The present paper aims at describing an algorithm that was developed for this purpose. based on the GCC (Grand Composite Curve) of Pinch Analysis and on Exergy Theory. The temperature scale of the GCC is divided in areas defined by the Main Pinch Point and Potential local Pinch Points. Then. every potential heat pump is evaluated. absorbing heat in any area for delivering in an upper one. The corresponding heat load and COP are calculated. Exergy cost of remaining cold utilities is calculated with a Carnot based-efficiency. exergy cost of hot utilities according to their nature and temperature. The global exergy cost is used as criteria. Thanks to its formulation. the algorithm may suggest heat pumps solutions in non-obvious areas.

The first method is to act on the supply side by integrating alternative means of power generation. such as renewable energy generators. having a relatively low levelized cost of energy. Whereas. the second methodology focuses on the management of the load to minimize the overall paid cost for energy. Thus. this article highlights the importance of demand side management by comparing it to the supply side management having. as criteria. the total achieved savings on the overall annual energy bill of a residential microgrid supplied by two power sources and equipped with an electric vehicle. The optimization takes into consideration the cost of kWh that is paid by the prosumer based on an economical model having as inputs the outcomes of the energy model. The adopted energy model integrates. on the demand side. an intelligent energy management system acting on secondary loads. and on the supply side. a photovoltaic (PV) system with and without battery energy storage system (BESS). The outcome of this work shows that. under the right circumstances. demand side management can be as valuable as supply side control.

The main contribution of this work is a new technique for collision avoidance by engaging the human and the robot in generating new collisionfree paths. In mobile robotics. collision avoidance is critical for the success of the robots in implementing their tasks. especially when the robots navigate in crowded and dynamic environments. which include humans. Traditional collision avoidance methods deal with the human as a dynamic obstacle. without taking into consideration that the human will also try to avoid the robot. and this causes the people and the robot to get confused. especially in crowded social places such as restaurants. hospitals. and laboratories. To avoid such scenarios. a reactive-supervised collision avoidance system for mobile robots based on human-robot interaction is implemented. In this method. both the robot and the human will collaborate in generating the collision avoidance via interaction. The person will notify the robot about the avoidance direction via interaction. and the robot will search for the optimal collision-free path on the selected direction. In case that no people interacted with the robot. it will select the navigation path autonomously and select the path that is closest to the goal location. The humans will interact with the robot using gesture recognition and Kinect sensor. To build the gesture recognition system. two models were used to classify these gestures. the first model is Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). and the second model is Support Vector Machine (SVM).

1158596,Economic and environmental impact of lead-acid batteries in grid-connected domestic PV systems,2013,Eoghan McKenna and Marcelle McManus and Sam Cooper and Murray Thomson,104,Applied energy,,239-249,Elsevier,Occupants of dwellings with grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems can often benefit financially from exporting electricity to the grid. When export prices are lower than import prices. however. occupants are incentivised to time-shift demand in order to avoid exports and reduce imports. To maximise this potential financial benefit. the addition of batteries to the PV system has been proposed to take advantage of the specific commercial opportunity presented to the occupant of trading exported power during the day for imported power during the evening.

The life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that in terms of environmental and energy impact the plant manufacture contributes very little to the whole life cycle impacts. The results show that compared with alternative energy supply the production and use of biogas is beneficial in terms of greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use. This is mainly due to the replacement of the alternative. kerosene. and from fertiliser production from the AD process. However. these benefits come at a cost to ecosystem health and the production of respiratory inorganics.

The options considered for recovering the heat were recovery for use on-site. using heat exchangers; upgrading the heat to a higher temperature. using heat pumps; conversion of the heat energy to fulfill a chilling demand. using absorption chillers; conversion of the heat energy to electrical energy. using Rankine cycles; and transport of the heat to fulfill an off-site heat demand.

A decomposition analysis was conducted to identify the effects of changes in output. structure and energy intensity on the changing energy demand. It was found that a falling energy intensity (indicating improving energy efficiency) was the principle reason for the fall in energy demand. As the UK manufacturing sector is so broad in its uses of energy. it was split into an energy-intensive (EI) and a non-energy-intensive (NEI) sub-sector to better understand the improvement in energy efficiency. The NEI sub-sector made much greater relative reductions in energy intensity in comparison to the EI subsector. Previous studies indicate that the EI sector may have made larger improvements in energy intensity in the period between 1973 and 1990 and this may be the reason for the limited improvement seen here.

1158638,Firm-level perspective on energy efficiency barrier and drivers in UK industry–indications from an online survey,2014,P Barua,,Recuperado de http://behaveconference. com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Baruah_Eyre_ BEHAVE _,,,,An online survey of production process related energy efficiency barriers. drivers and the decision-making process was carried out among a number of UK industrial sector stakeholders. Survey responses indicated that access to capital. regulatory uncertainty and long/uncertain paybacks are major barriers to energy efficiency investments in UK industry. Cost savings and long-term strategy were found to be primary drivers of energy efficiency. Average payback criterion for energy efficiency investments was about three years and was slightly higher than other typical investments. In companies where energy efficiency was strategically important. decision-making was found to be more integrated into the mainstream business process. Energy and environmental audits followed by external consultants and colleagues in the industry were viewed as the most credible sources of energy efficiency information. whereas energy companies were viewed with least credibility.

1158639,Thermodynamic Analysis of the UK Industrial Sector,2009,GP Hammond and RC McKenna and JB Norman,,,,,,Thermodynamic analysis of the industrial sector is carried out based on estimated energy demand and temperature profile data for UK industrial sites derived from the National Allocation Plan (NAP) of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The data is aggregated to sub-sectors and end use is split into motor systems. combined heat and power and heating processes. which are further broken down into five temperature bands. steam systems and direct heating processes. An energy and exergy analysis is performed to give final demand energy and exergy efficiencies of 53% and 35% respectively. Sankey and Grassmann diagrams illustrate the flows of energy and exergy through industry. Heat cascading could theoretically reduce final demand for heat to 30% of the present value; this would be limited in reality due to technical. economic and market constraints. Due to the lack of accurate data the industrial sector is difficult to model using a general methodology. so the results here are indicative rather than precise. The thermodynamic assessment carried out here is one quantitative technique in a 'toolkit' for assessing and improving sustainability. which should also include other methods such as environmental Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA).,True,1El1-tEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/21241211,14799273437220085746,/scholar?cites=14799273437220085746,,,0,0,0

Due to the cost and complexity of developing such extensive tables. industry sectors are generally represented at a rather aggregate level. Currently. one of the most important applications of input–output analysis is environmental assessments. for which highly aggregate sectors may not be sufficient to yield accurate results. We experiment with four of the most important global MRIO systems available. analyzing the sensitivity of a set of aggregate CO2 multipliers to aggregations in the MRIO tables used to calculate them.

We outline a decomposition methodology for investigating the variations that exist when using different multiregional input–output (MRIO) systems to calculate a region's consumption-based account. Structural decomposition analysis attributes the change in emissions to a set of dependent determinants. such as technical coefficients. the Leontief inverse and final demands.

However. harder-to-reach fossil fuels require more energy to extract and. hence. are coming at an increasing ‘energy cost’. Associated declines in fossil fuel energy-return-on-investment ratios at first appear of little concern. given that published estimates for oil. coal and gas are typically above 25: 1. However. such ratios are measured at the primary energy stage and should instead be estimated at the final stage where energy enters the economy (for example. electricity and petrol). Here. we calculate global time series (1995–2011) energy-return-on-investment ratios for fossil fuels at both primary and final energy stages. We concur with common primary-stage estimates (~ 30: 1). but find very low ratios at the final stage: around 6: 1 and declining.

However. in order to test these concerns on a national scale. there is a conceptual and methodological gap in relation to calculating a national-level EROI and analysing its policy implications. We address this by developing a novel application of an Input-Output methodology to calculate a national-level indirect energy investment. one of the components needed for calculating a national-level EROI. This is a mixed physical and monetary approach using Multi-Regional Input-Output data and an energy extension. We discuss some conceptual and methodological issues relating to defining EROI for a national economy. and describe in detail the methodology and data requirements for the approach. We obtain initial results for the UK for the period 1997–2012. which show that the country’s EROI has been declining since the beginning of the 21st Century.

When export prices are lower than import prices. however. occupants are incentivised to time-shift demand in order to avoid exports and reduce imports. To maximise this potential financial benefit. the addition of batteries to the PV system has been proposed to take advantage of the specific commercial opportunity presented to the occupant of trading exported power during the day for imported power during the evening.

Using the Irish All-Island power system as a case-study. data on the observed dispatch of each large generator for the years 2008 to 2012 was used to estimate a marginal emissions factor of 0.547 kgCO2/kWh. Selected storage operation scenarios were used to estimate storage emissions factors – the carbon emissions impact associated with each unit of storage energy used. The results show that carbon emissions increase in the short-run for all storage technologies when consistently operated in ‘peak shaving and trough filling’ modes. and indicate that this should also be true for the GB and US power systems. Carbon emissions increase when storage is operated in ‘wind balancing’ mode. but reduce when storage is operated to reduce wind power curtailment. as in this …,True,MfQLrIMAAAAJ:4vMrXwiscB8C,20,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957650916671432,3974656426566392751,/scholar?cites=3974656426566392751,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0957650916671432,0,0,0
1158680,Can practice make perfect (models)? Incorporating social practice theory into quantitative energy demand models,2014,Sarah L Higginson and Eoghan McKenna and Murray Thomson,,,,,Loughborough University,Demand response could be increasingly valuable in coping with the intermittency of  a future renewables-dominated electricity grid. There is a growing body of work  being done specifically on understanding demand response from a people and  practices point of view. This paper will start by introducing some of the recent  research in this area and will present social practice theory (SPT) as a useful way of  looking at the flexibility and timing of energy-use practices. However. for the insights gained from SPT to have value for the electricity supply  industry it is important to be able to represent this flexibility in quantitative energy  demand models. This requires an interdisciplinary conversation that allows SPT and  modelling concepts to be mapped together. This paper presents an initial step in  trying to achieve this. Drawing on empirical data from a recent SPT study into flexible  energy-use practices. it will experiment with modelling flexible demand in such a  way as to take account of the complexity of practices; not just their ‘stuff’ but also  some of the images and skills involved in their competent performance. There are several reasons this is a useful enterprise. It encourages interdisciplinary  insights which are valuable both to social practice theory and to energy demand  modelling. it highlights new ways of intervening in flexible demand and it establishes  a research agenda for social practice theorists and modellers which will eventually  result in a set of requirements that can be used to build an energy demand model  based on practice theory.

1158681,Demand response in low-carbon power systems: a review of residential electrical demand response projects,2011,Eoghan McKenna and Kaushik Ghosh and Murray Thomson,,,,,Loughborough University,The transition to a future low-carbon power system will increase the need for and value of demand response – where demand can be curtailed or shifted in time according to the network’s requirements. The electricity supply industry is investing heavily in ‘smart’ technologies. partly based on the assumption that demand response will be available when it is needed. yet this is an unfamiliar concept to most consumers. who still view electricity as a resource that can be consumed as and when they want it. That such a gap exists between the reality on the ground and the requirements of the future is a cause for concern. yet the methods proposed today to achieve demand response are based predominantly on assumptions that people will accept and respond to variations in the price of electricity. There is however growing evidence that the ‘people are economic actors’ approach is inadequate when dealing with the complexities of energy-use within the home. This paper reviews existing residential demand response projects. and supports the growing realisation that the principal challenge in demand response is no longer the technology itself but rather its acceptance and use by the consumer. In order to deal with this challenge. a more holistic approach to demand response is needed. one that can better deal with both the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ sides of the system.,True,MfQLrIMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,18,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Demand_response_in_low-carbon_power_systems_a_review_of_residential_electrical_demand_response_projects/9554300/1,11840182504700720471,/scholar?cites=11840182504700720471,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/conference_contribution/Demand_response_in_low-carbon_power_systems_a_review_of_residential_electrical_demand_response_projects/9554300/files/17186048.pdf,0,0,0
1158682,Demand response of domestic consumers to dynamic electricity pricing in low-carbon power systems,2013,Eoghan McKenna,,,,,,The ability for domestic consumers to provide demand response to dynamic electricity pricing will become increasingly valuable for integrating the high penetrations of renewables that are expected to be connected to electricity networks in the future. The aim of this thesis is to investigate whether domestic consumers will be willing and able to provide demand response in such low-carbon futures. A broad approach is presented in this thesis. with research contributions on subjects including data privacy. behavioural economics. and battery modelling. The principle argument of the thesis is that studying the behaviour of consumers with grid-connected photovoltaic ('PV') systems can provide insight into how consumers might respond to dynamic pricing in future low-carbon power systems. as both experience irregular electricity prices that are correlated with intermittent renewable generation. Through a combination of statistical and qualitative methods. this thesis investigates the demand response behaviour of consumers with PV systems in the UK. The results demonstrate that these consumers exhibit demand response behaviour by increasing demand during the day and decreasing demand during the evening. Furthermore. this effect is more pronounced on days with higher irradiance. The results are novel in three ways. First. they provide quantified evidence that suggests that domestic consumers with PV systems engage in demand response behaviour. Second. they provide evidence of domestic consumers responding to irregular electricity prices that are correlated with intermittent renewable generation. thereby addressing the aim of this …,True,MfQLrIMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,14,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.570218,17517448408380078135,/scholar?cites=17517448408380078135,,,0,0,0

1158684,Analysis of international residential solar PV self-consumption,2019,Eoghan McKenna and Ellen Webborn and Philip Leicester and Simon Elam,,,,,ECEEE,How much does installing solar photovoltaic (‘PV’) panels reduce domestic electricity bills? Despite over 800.000 households with solar panels in the UK today. we do not have a firm answer to this simple question. This is because the empirical data necessary to calculate solar self-consumption is not widely available; an issue common to many countries. Without electricity metering that records solar PV generation. imports and exports. it is impossible to know exactly how much solar power is being used directly in the household. and as a result. how much solar panels actually reduce electricity bills. As many countries reduce state subsidies. the revenue stream from avoided grid imports (i.e. self-consumption) becomes increasingly critical for the economic viability of PV. Quantifying this potential revenue is also vital for the solar industry to evaluate the potential benefits of battery storage and flexibility services. This paper will help to address this knowledge gap by analysing a previously unused dataset of electricity readings from over 1.300 households with solar panels located across the UK. USA. Australia. Germany. the Netherlands. and Belgium. The results show there is considerable variation in self-consumption between different households. but this is relatively well explained by differences in the amount of solar electricity generated and the amount of electricity consumed during the day (r-squared 0.915). and that the factors affecting self-consumption are similar between the different countries analysed here.

A key assessment criterion for energy efficiency policies is their expected impact on CO2 emissions and. accordingly. governments require environmental impact assessments to inform decisions about which policies should be supported. As electricity systems decarbonise and progress towards higher penetrations of renewable energy. however. system balancing becomes increasingly challenging and. as a result. there is increasing value in demand response. The efficiency of low-carbon systems depends not only on policies that promote demand reduction. but also those that promote demand response. Smart appliances are. from the grid’s perspective. a means to achieve demand response and this paper is interested in the question: how much CO2 do smart appliances save. in their capacity as ‘demand response technologies’?

1158691,Creating domestic building thermal performance ratings using smart meter data,2020,Jenny Crawley and Eoghan McKenna and Virginia Gori and Tadj Oreszczyn,,Buildings & Cities,,,,Energy performance certificates (EPCs) are ratings of domestic building energy performance mandated across the European Union. Their aim is to provide a reliable assessment of a building’s energy performance whilst accounting for non-building effects such as weather and occupancy. Current rating methods. based on theoretical calculations. can introduce significant error from an inability to estimate real building performance. Other methods using real energy data cannot isolate building performance from other effects due to low data resolution. The installation of smart meters in large proportions of the housing stock in European Union member states presents an opportunity.

The model is computationally efficient and can easily provide data at 1-min resolution for large numbers of dwellings. As a primary input. the model uses a time-series representing the number of active occupants within a dwelling (people who are at home and awake). This allows it to represent the sharing of lighting between the occupants of a given dwelling and facilitates correlated linking to models of other energy use within the dwelling.

The principle novelty of the model is its integrated structure such that the timing of thermal and electrical output variables are appropriately correlated. The model has been developed primarily for low-voltage network analysis and the model’s ability to account for demand diversity is of critical importance for this application. The model. however. can also serve as a basis for modelling domestic energy demands within the broader field of urban energy systems analysis.

When export prices are lower than import prices. however. occupants are incentivised to time-shift demand in order to avoid exports and reduce imports. To maximise this potential financial benefit. the addition of batteries to the PV system has been proposed to take advantage of the specific commercial opportunity presented to the occupant of trading exported power during the day for imported power during the evening. This paper therefore assesses the economic and environmental impact of the use of lead-acid batteries in grid-connected PV systems under current feed-in tariff arrangements in the UK.

Expected lifetime. perception of brokenness and attitude towards maintenance and repair,2015,Giuseppe Salvia and Tim Cooper and Tom Fisher and Luke Harmer and Christopher Barr,,,,342-348,,This paper addresses the discrepancy between the expected and actual lifetimes of vacuum cleaners considering perceived ‘brokenness’ as a driver for replacement. Among electrical products. vacuum cleaners have a high rate of domestic ownership in the UK. They also embody large quantities of greenhouse gases which could be reduced by increasing their longevity and resource efficiency (Schreiber et al.. 2012). A focus on energy efficiency has only shown limited or even negative results. therefore to meet recent European Union regulations on durability requirements a focus on product longevity is needed. Around one half of new vacuum cleaner purchasers replace one less than 5 years old. below the expected lifespan. with perceived breakage. poor performance and unreliability as the major reasons for replacement. Their relative simplicity could allow vacuum cleaners to last for significantly longer. The nature of the common causes of failure is known. including stretched cords or blockages. and WRAP has developed guidelines for product improvements.

The tendency towards accumulation have been terrifically increased in the last decades bringing to the Hyperconsumerism Society. that is an affluent society in a hypertrophy époque based on the creation of artificial needs for organized wasting (Lepovetsky. 2007). The aforementioned habits have been causing drastic environmental repercussions. mostly defined in the design phase (Thackara. 2005). To remediate to own responsibilities. designers have to make a radical ethical choice in order to become active agents in the transition towards sustainable ways of living (Manzini. 2006). Among the four potential approaches that designer can adopt for sustainability. “designing new production– consumption systems” appears to be one of the most promising (Vezzoli & Manzini. 2008). New sustainable patterns of consumption and production (SCP) have been increasingly studied and proposed even in international institutional level (OECD 2002). where durability and a revised relation with objects system is fostered. In the research here presented. alternative sustainable relationship between individuals and objects has been studied to prolong artefacts lifespan in their whole life-cycle; a new relation sustained by the rediscovery of the affective tie for the goal of the achievement of environmental gains.

This will have a dramatic impact on the demands for primary materials and energy. It has been estimated that with improvements in design and manufacturing it is possible to maintain the current level of production using 70% of the current primary material consumed. Even with these improvements on the production side. there will still be a doubling of primary material requirements by the end of the century. with accompanying rises in industrial energy demand. if the rise in demand for goods and  services is to be met. It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. Product longevity and using goods more intensively are two strategies which could reduce the demand for new goods. If products last longer. then manufacturing output can concentrate on emerging markets rather than the market for replacement goods. There are many goods which are infrequently used. these seldom wear out. The total demand for such could be drastically reduced if they we re shared with other people. Sharing of goods has traditionally been conducted between friends or by hiring equipment. but modern communication systems and social media could increase the opportunities to share goods. Sharing goods also increases access to a range of goods for those on low incomes. From a series of workshops it has been found that the principal challenges are sociological rather than technological.

Other cities then followed. including Amsterdam. Boulder. and Rio de Janeiro. Their pursuits to become sharing cities also intended to face major contemporary urban challenges. including global urbanization [2] and resource depletion [3]. Sharing cities make use of (often smart) technologies to connect a larger number of users to idling assets. hence to be ‘shared’by a wider population. rather than being individually owned. Within this trend. assets that are typically shared include vehicles and rides. bedrooms and accommodation. as well as tools and competences. Environmental. social and business advantages are envisaged by many [4–6]. often leading to significant financial investments by industries. public bodies and international organizations. Sharing cities is a locution which has emerged to express the marriage of the sharing economy in urban areas [7–9]. Davidson and Infranca [10] describe urban conditions as fundamental for the value proposition of the innovative elements of the current sharing hype. The physical and social configuration of a city shapes the way in which sharing takes place: size and type of fabric. mobility and accessibility. availability of public spaces. social norms. habits and traditions and. therefore. the unit of analysis.

It reports on ongoing empirical research using product analysis. ethnographic interviews. a questionnaire and student design work into the possibility of increasing the longevity of vacuum cleaners by design interventions. Because its object of study is a cleaning product used in everyday cleaning practices. the research naturally connects with Douglas’ ideas as well as more recent work such as Dant 2003 that focuses on how people deal practically with the materiality of dirt. not determined by cultural categories.

This research envisaged the DIY trend as an opportunity to foster sustainable impact in a society where everyone can and does design. In this paper the role of Design in this ‘new’ DIY age is addressed. In particular professional designer as facilitator in investigated when supporting the DIY practitioners in repairing. reusing and in general practices prolonging product lifespan (RE-DIY). The facilitator role is studied through action research approach by setting four workshops in Italy in which designers supported practitioners in repairing and repurposing in ideal workspaces. The repairing workshops validated the hypothesis of a positive contribution by design in supporting the development of RE-DIY practice by optimizing resources (e.g. saving materials). informing on processing (e.g. 3D printing). increasing quality (e.g. refining the aesthetics). Critical components of the workshops have been identified such as the relevance of facilities. availability of time. emotional attachment to the item.

Singapore,Post-occupancy evaluations of building energy performances after retrofit often show values of energy use higher than calculated during the design phase. This performance gap is due to different factors. among which the user behaviour plays a crucial role.

The growing pressure. primarily driven by environmental concerns. for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far. DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators.

This is important since wind power is variable. so it will be necessary to retain a significant proportion of conventional plant to ensure security of supply especially under conditions of high demand and low wind. Hence. the capacity value of wind generation will be limited as it will not be possible to displace conventional generation capacity on a “megawatt for megawatt” basis. Wind power is variable and not easy to predict. hence various forms of additional reserves will be needed to maintain the balance between supply and demand at all times.

Although its availability has a substantial value. because it mitigates the considerable social and economic costs of outages. the provision of SR is costly. Unit commitment programs customarily include a reserve constraint in their optimisation procedure to ensure that a fixed amount of SR is scheduled. This approach is sub-optimum. because it considers explicitly neither the cost of providing this amount of reserve. nor the value that consumers place on not being disconnected.

Rapid increase in the new installations of PV modules across Europe in the past few years demands better understanding of the system impacts that PV will bring to the European electricity systems. These impact assessments and quantifications are critical for determining the actual full cost of PV and subsequently the competitiveness of PV in relation to other generation technologies.In this report. an expert team from Imperial College of London. presents the approaches and the results of quantifying PV system integration costs in 11 key EU markets. The aim is to check the feasibility of installing up to 480 GW PV by 2030. covering more than 10% of the European electricity demand.

In comparison to standards derived from a traditional approach. that is. case studies on a small number of specific real or test networks. the proposed approach facilitates the derivation of more robust conclusions on optimal network design policies and can thus be used as a valuable tool for decision support.

In particular. the need for frequency response. required to deal with sudden frequency drops following a loss of generator. will increase because of the limited inertia capability of wind plants. This paper quantifies the requirements for primary frequency response and analyses the benefits of frequency response provision from DSR. The results show dramatic changes in frequency response requirements driven by high penetration of wind. Case studies carried out by using an advanced stochastic generation scheduling model suggest that the provision of frequency response from DSR could greatly reduce the system operation cost. wind curtailment and carbon emissions in the future GB system characterised by high penetration of wind. Furthermore. the results demonstrate that the benefit of DSR shows significant diurnal and seasonal variation. whereas an even more rapid (instant) delivery of frequency response from DSR could provide significant additional value. Our studies also indicate that the competing technologies to DSR. namely battery storage and more flexible generation could potentially reduce its value by up to 35%. still leaving significant room to deploy DSR as frequency response provider.,True,DxHcK4oAAAAJ:RoXSNcbkSzsC,39,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2015.00036/full,3301989598279391969,/scholar?cites=3301989598279391969,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2015.00036/full,0,0,0

The central point of DG integration is first of all to quantify the extent to which different DG technologies can replace network assets as well as the extent to which DG can be said to drive investment in network capacity. It is argued that the way to realise economic and technical integration of DG into the power system in an efficient and consistent way is through network pricing.

Almost all high temperature outputs in the steel industry have their thermal energy exchanged to preheat inputs to the process.

These models assume that energy is an intermediate product of some combination of human labour and capital. These models also assume that the supply of energy is driven by economic demand. We assume the contrary. i.e. that useful energy is a primary input. derived (mostly) from natural capital.

Once copper attaches during hammer shredding. no commercial process beyond hand-picking exists to extract it. yet high-value flat products require less than 0.1 wt pct copper to avoid metallurgical problems.

Therefore. for the first time. a framework is proposed to define the full range of separation routes and evaluate their potential to remove copper. while estimating their energy and material input requirements.

Some models use the material properties of the material in bulk as inputs for modelling the densification of assemblies of powder particles.

Existing works tend to analyse bulk material or powder exclusively and rarely compare properties such as hardness between the two. This work compares the microstructures and hardness of metal powder with bulk material with the aim of guiding the assumptions made in the modelling of metal powder densification.

Besides estimating the carbon intensity of electricity production. we propose a new indicator. the carbon intensity of electricity use. which quantifies CO 2/kWh of electricity derived useful exergy. Results show final to useful efficiency dilution until World War I (50% to 30%) due to a decrease in share of the high-efficiency transport sector and from mid-1940s to 1960 and mid-1990s onwards (58% to 47% and 47% to 40%) due to an increase in share of the low efficiency commercial and residential sector.

1158795,The impact of reducing car weight on global emissions: the future fleet in Great Britain,2017,Andre Cabrera Serrenho and Jonathan B Norman and Julian Allwood,,,,,Royal Society Publishing,Current European policies define targets for future direct emissions of new car sales that foster a fast transition to electric drivetrain technologies. However. these targets do not consider the emissions produced in electricity generation and material production. and therefore fail to incentivise car manufacturers to consider the benefits of vehicle weight reduction. In this paper. we examine the potential benefits of limiting the average weight and altering the material composition of new cars in terms of global greenhouse gas emissions produced during the use phase. electricity generation and material production. We anticipate the emissions savings for the future car fleet in Great Britain until 2050 for various alternative futures. using a dynamic material flow analysis of ferrous metals and aluminium. and considering an evolving demand for car use. The results suggest that fostering vehicle weight reduction could produce greater cumulative emissions savings by 2050 than those obtained by incentivising a fast transition to electric drivetrains. unless there is an extreme decarbonization of the electricity grid. Savings promoted by weight reduction are immediate and do not depend on the pace of decarbonization of the electricity grid. Weight reduction may produce the greatest savings when mild steel in the car body is replaced with high-strength steel.

However. the substitution of Portland cement with fly ash (FA) reduces both the energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions generated during the production of clinker. Currently. most studies of FA concrete focus on mechanical properties. sustainability assessments (environment. society and economy) of FA during its life cycle have not been reported.

1158803,Design for deconstruction: An appraisal,2013,Danielle Densley Tingley,,,,,,This thesis contains an assessment and discussion of the sustainability of design for deconstruction. As a basis for the work. existing literature was reviewed and the gaps in existing knowledge highlighted. Environmental assessment methods were identified as a way to incentivise design for deconstruction.  An analysis of LEED demonstrated minimal achievement of reuse credits. likely due to limited availability of reused materials. The supply chain can be developed in the future through the design for deconstruction of all new buildings.  Quantifying the environmental benefits of design for deconstruction was underlined as a key strategy to encourage designers to consider the incorporation of design for deconstruction. A methodology was developed to account for designed-in future reuse at the initial design stage. This is based on a PAS2050 methodology (2008) which shares the environmental impact of an element over the number of predicted lives. In the course of this work it has been assumed that the typical building has a fifty year life span. a conservative estimate. Studies in this thesis limit analysis to a hundred year period. giving a possible two lives for the majority of elements. The methodology was used as a basis for the calculation of savings that occur by designing for deconstruction. Initial feasibility studies estimated that a 49% saving in embodied carbon is accomplished by designing for deconstruction. Having demonstrated the potential scope of savings. a tool. Sakura. was developed to enable designers to investigate the savings in embodied energy and carbon for their own schemes.

This will have a dramatic impact on the demands for primary materials and energy. It has been estimated that with improvements in design and manufacturing it is possible to maintain the current level of production using 70% of the current primary material consumed. Even with these improvements on the production side. there will still be a doubling of primary material requirements by the end of the century. with accompanying rises in industrial energy demand. if the rise in demand for goods and  services is to be met. It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. Product longevity and using goods more intensively are two strategies which could reduce the demand for new goods. If products last longer. then manufacturing output can concentrate on emerging markets rather than the market for replacement goods. There are many goods which are infrequently used. these seldom wear out. The total demand for such could be drastically reduced if they we re shared with other people. Sharing of goods has traditionally been conducted between friends or by hiring equipment. but modern communication systems and social media could increase the opportunities to share goods. Sharing goods also increases access to a range of goods for those on low incomes. From a series of workshops it has been found that the principal challenges are sociological rather than technological.

1158810,Should energy labels for washing machines be expanded to include a durability rating?,2015,N Braithwaite and D Densley-Tingley and M Moreno,,,,9-18,Nottingham Trent University: CADBE,Washing machines are a key household appliance that can be found in the majority of UK homes. Over 2.5 million are sold in the UK every year and account for one of the highest material and production impacts of householder products in the UK (WRAP. 2011). Energy efficiency ratings are provided as a method for consumers to make an informed purchasing decision and were brought in by EU legislation to reduce energy use and enable users to reduce running costs. as it is known that the greater environmental impact of a washing machine is during use. From 2014. all washing machines sold must be at a minimum A rated. with ratings increasing to A+++. However. under this current labelling system the embodied impacts and durability of the machines are ignored. Through semi-structured interviews with consumers. manufacturers and distributors. this paper explores different perceptions of longevity and expectations of performance and durability. The paper explores whether energy labels should be expanded to include durability information. as this could enable consumers to make a decision based not only on cost and energy efficiency but also on expected lifespan. Existing manufacturer’s guarantees may give an indication of the expected durability of the product and this is investigated to explore if there is a positive correlation. The findings will further discuss the potential impacts of providing durability information and how this could enable manufacturers and consumers to shift towards a low material and energy future.,True,5FTW5ocAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,8,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/8546/,2219560969979719799,/scholar?cites=2219560969979719799,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/8546/1/220134_PubSub2377_Moreno.pdf,0,0,0

Cham,This chapter explores the connections between the circular economy and the reduction of embodied carbon. Circular economic approaches focus on maintaining the value of materials for as long as possible. A circular economy seeks to keep materials in circulation. removing the concept of waste from the system and the need for material extraction from primary sources. In a completely circular economy. all ‘waste’ outputs would equal system inputs. If the built environment is thought about in this way. as a system. then the inputs are construction materials. and these materials accumulate in buildings. which can also be thought of as the stock. Demolition waste is the output flow of materials in this system. This concept can also be extended to embodied carbon. Construction materials are input flows of embodied carbon. These emissions are new to the system.

It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. Product longevity and using goods more intensively are two strategies which could reduce the demand for new goods. If products last longer. then manufacturing output can concentrate on emerging markets rather than the market for replacement goods. There are many goods which are infrequently used. these seldom wear out. The total demand for such could be drastically reduced if they we re shared with other people. Sharing of goods has traditionally been conducted between friends or by hiring equipment. but modern communication systems and social media could increase the opportunities to share goods. Sharing goods also increases access to a range of goods for those on low incomes. From a series of workshops it has been found that the principal challenges are sociological rather than technological.

1158823,Product leasing: a strategy to allow manufacturers and customers to benefit from elongation of product life,2015,John G. Roger and Alexandre Rodrigues,1,,1,318-323,Nottingham Trent University: CADBE,International development means that the number of people who can be considered as consumers is projected to triple by 2030. This is good news but if we consume goods in the same way as people did in the 20th Century it will lead to an unsustainable rise in industrial greenhouse gas emissions and contribute towards material scarcities. The old axioms of maintaining profits by high turnover of low profit margins goods. and boosting demand by releasing new models needs to be reconsidered for a sustainable future. The key point is that people’s needs are met by using goods not just acquiring them. One way of reducing the demand for new goods is to use old ones for longer. This study looked at second hand car data and concluded that cars are scrapped when they have a low market value not when they are worn out. It follows that if the second hand value can be raised. cars could potentially be used for longer. One way of increasing the value of a second hand item to a business is to value it as a future profit generator as well as for its market value. A long term lease model has been considered and found to be potentially beneficial to both the supplier and customer.,True,a0q-lJ8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,3,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/27477/,179965255550934233,/scholar?cites=179965255550934233,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/27477/1/EP27477_Rodrigues_NTUimprint.pdf,0,0,0
1158824,Driving in the wrong lane: towards a longer life-span of cars,2015,Alexandre Rodrigues and Tim Cooper and Matthew Watkins,1,,1,311-317,Nottingham Trent University: CADBE,Within the context of product longevity. one especially impactful and ubiquitous product demands further research: the car. Car longevity has been addressed in the context of product life extension and product lifetime optimisation but there have been a few studies on car longevity in the context of business and none specifically from an industrial design context. This paper presents initial findings from preliminary interviews with key industry representatives such as car designers and engineers. It discusses the barriers to and opportunities for designing a car with a longer life-span. This and further data will later be analysed in order to produce a design framework to inform car designers on life-span and usage optimization through design. Strategies such as increased longevity or use-intensity can potentially reduce the throughput - and thereafter the consumption - of cars. Such a shift in the automotive sector would support the transition from a linear economy to a more sustainable one. The initial findings. however. suggest that a longer life car is not an uncompromised solution and important concessions would have to be made in order to make this an acceptable product.,True,a0q-lJ8AAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/27101/,10397463959863412728,/scholar?cites=10397463959863412728,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/27101/1/PubSub4443_Watkins.pdf,0,0,0

Different solutions have been suggested in order to reduce their environmental burden. There is currently little evidence on whether user-intensive cars are fit for purpose or overcome issues such as ownership. cleanliness. and performance under different driving styles. This paper presents initial findings from ten interviews concerning user-intensive passenger  cars with industry representatives such as car designers and engineers. It identifies. mainly from a design and development point of view. the barriers and opportunities to user-intensive vehicles.

1158827,Driving in the wrong lane: towards a change in paradigm for optimal passenger car lifespans,2018,Alexandre Rodrigues,,,,,,Passenger cars are responsible for high demands of energy and materials. both from  manufacturing and use stage; raw material resource extraction. transformation. use and  disposal. Their energy and material efficiencies are far from perfect. despite the car. and its incumbent industry. being present and influential in society for almost a century and half. The premise of car design. manufacturing process. business model and use have scarcely evolved or changed drastically. Nations have been producing and consuming this product unsustainably.  The surge of developing nations and their consumption demands is adding further pressure on resources and energy use. This PhD is focused on how to reduce passenger car impacts through two alternative consumption models; longer lifespans (extensive) and car share (intensive). These may contribute towards a necessary transition of the overall incumbent car regime and its different elements – business models. design. manufacturing. sales. usage and disposal – towards more sustainable use of materials and energy by reducing their demand and consumption. It aims to understand the role of some of its different actors but also to understand why alternative - and less impactful - forms of car use have not succeeded and how a transition to a different car regime can be triggered.   The literature review looked critically into the automotive industry's failure to become more  sustainable. It compared extensive and intensive use. the desirable design aspects of the former and impacts of the latter. It looked into transition models. car cultures. their influence in car consumption and use.

1158828,Systemic Barriers to Upscaling Car Sharing in the UK,2016,Alexandre Rodrigues and Tim Cooper and Matthew Watkins,1,,1,237,The Centre of Sustainable Design,Several studies suggest that increasing the quality of cars and their durability through design enables important reductions in their environmental impact (Fuhrmann 1979. Nieuwenhuis 1994. Kagawa. Tasaki et al. 2006. Allwood. Cullen 2012. Kagawa. Hubacek et al. 2013). However. significant variations in the lifetime of cars around the world suggest that design may not be the root cause (Oguchi. Fuse 2014) and consumer attitudes towards product lifetimes may also be relevant (Cooper 2004. 2005. Evans and Cooper 2010).Moreover. some studies suggest that products with a high energy impact during the user stage should be instead designed as use-intensive products (van Nes. Cramer 2006). An investigation by Rodrigues. Cooper et al.(2015b) found that many automotive designers argued that potential environmental benefits from longer lasting cars could be undermined by increased weight. which would increase CO2 emissions in use. A subsequent study on the design of cars for use-intensity concluded that a systemic approach would be required to develop a favourable market (Rodrigues. Cooper et al. 2015a). Such a market already exists in the form of car sharing. but it is marginal in size when compared to conventional car ownership.,True,a0q-lJ8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/32275/1/9670_a657_Cooper.pdf,,,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/32275/1/9670_a657_Cooper.pdf,0,0,0

Cooper and D. Densley-Tingley and A. Rodrigues and G. Salvia,,,,547-561,Coventry University,It has been estimated that by 2030 the number of people who are wealthy enough to be considered as middle class consumers will have tripled. This will have a dramatic impact on the demands for primary materials and energy. Much work has been carried out on sustainable ways of meeting the World’s energy demands and some work has been carried out on the sustainable production and consumption of goods. It has been estimated that with improvements in design and manufacturing it is possible to reduce the primary material requirements by 30% to produce the current demand for goods. Whilst this is a crucial step on the production side. there will still be a doubling of primary material requirements by the end of the century because of an absolute rise in demand for goods and services. It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. This is a key areas of research for the UK INDEMAND centre. which is investigating ways of reducing the UK’s industrial energy demand and demand for energy intensive materials. Our ongoing work shows that two strategies would result in considerable reductions in the demand for primary materials: product longevity and using goods more intensively (which may requires increased durability). Product longevity and durability are not new ideas. but ones that can be applied across a raft of goods as methods of reducing the consumption of materials. With long life products there is a potential risk of outdated design and obsolescence. consequently there is a need to ensure upgradability and adaptability are incorporated at the design stage.

1158832,Moving beyond the circular economy,2014,Mariale Moreno and Naomi Braithwaite and Tim Cooper,,Proceedings of Going Green-CARE Innovation,,1-10,,The production model. which currently underpins our material prosperity. remains highly resource-intensive. and the volume of minerals. ores and fossil fuels consumed annually is set to triple by 2050 unless economic growth is decoupled from resource consumption [1]. One response that has been attracting significant attention is the idea of a circular economy (or close loop economy). in which waste is transformed into value rather than disposed of to landfill [2]. While acknowledging potential benefits to businesses of a circular economy. this paper critically reviews the model and proposes an approach that addresses concerns that even recycling processes have energy impacts through transportation. reprocessing and subsequent manufacturing. and that in practice it is impossible to have a complete circular system in which there is no use of virgin materials and no final waste. It presents an overarching framework that responds to such concerns. built by studying different circular models in a macro-level perspective and then tailoring tactics for different sectors in a micro-level perspective [3. 4. 5. 6]. The paper explains how the framework was built and how it is applied to the large household appliance (LHA) sector. through developing two emerging models based on product-service systems (PSS). The paper presents findings from a workshop in which the two models were presented to industry representatives. revealing their responses regarding the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed models to go beyond the circular economy.,True,W6d2SaMAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,25,https://www.academia.edu/download/38526127/R-Care_Innovation_final_version-libre.pdf,1793075500553264202,/scholar?cites=1793075500553264202,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38526127/R-Care_Innovation_final_version-libre.pdf,0,0,0

Over 2.5 million are sold in the UK every year and account for one of the highest material and production impacts of householder products in the UK (WRAP. 2011). Energy efficiency ratings are provided as a method for consumers to make an informed purchasing decision and were brought in by EU legislation to reduce energy use and enable users to reduce running costs. as it is known that the greater environmental impact of a washing machine is during use. From 2014. all washing machines sold must be at a minimum A rated. with ratings increasing to A+++. However. under this current labelling system the embodied impacts and durability of the machines are ignored. Through semi-structured interviews with consumers. manufacturers and distributors. this paper explores different perceptions of longevity and expectations of performance and durability. The paper explores whether energy labels should be expanded to include durability information. as this could enable consumers to make a decision based not only on cost and energy efficiency but also on expected lifespan. Existing manufacturer’s guarantees may give an indication of the expected durability of the product and this is investigated to explore if there is a positive correlation. The findings will further discuss the potential impacts of providing durability information and how this could enable manufacturers and consumers to shift towards a low material and energy future.,True,W6d2SaMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,8,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/8546/,2219560969979719799,/scholar?cites=2219560969979719799,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/8546/1/220134_PubSub2377_Moreno.pdf,0,0,0

Adopting a holistic approach to the study of creativity research revealed that ideas. contrary to existing discourse. are not always the starting point of a fashion object’s life. It was frequently the materials of shoe design. in other words the physical matter that would constitute the final form of these designer shoes. which the designers would narrate as the starting point of their creativity. The shoe is a material structure whereby materials are not solely confined to the aesthetic exterior but impel the future functioning of the shoe and significantly its creative biography. In the context of creativity in fashion. the chapter will present shoe design as an embodied process whereby materials will be revealed to be both inspirational and agentic.

1158843,Shoe design: an ethnographic study of creativity,2012,NJ Braithwaite,,,,,,The empirical focus of this thesis is the creative practice of a select number of contemporary British based high fashion women's shoe designers. The research responds to an existing gap in theoretical debates on fashion. in particular shoes. as to what creativity in design entails. Based upon a twenty month long ethnography with twenty three shoe designers and other informants. my thesis contributes original knowledge of what shoe designers do to create shoes. Through a holistic approach to the study of creativity. the research demonstrates that ideas are not always the starting point of creativity. The designers work as individuals and thus their creative process cannot be reduced to the strict linear sequence that design discourse can assume. My work contributes to material culture by demonstrating. in the context of shoe design. what materiality actually is. The thesis reveals the inspirational and agentic properties of the materials of shoe design. just as the practitioners act upon the materials so do materials act upon them. Through the study of materials creativity is presented as an embodied practice where the practitioner exists in a dialogue between materials. creative processes and forms. By showing how materials give life to shoes. I have produced a significantly mc e dynarric approach to material culture. The research has encompassed the creative network surrounding the shoe designer and reveals the complexity and relationality of the creative process. I have shown that creativity in shoe design moves beyond the realm of the individual to encompass a network of humans and materials.

Data analysis from The Guardian has revealed that almost every town centre in England and Wales has declined since 2013. with some towns losing over a fifth of their stores. Factors influencing this demise range from Brexit uncertainty. increased rents and business rates. rising operating costs and an increase in online shopping. The aim of this paper is to explore the cult of celebrity. its deployment within social media. and how this has been central to the rise of online retailing. and ultimately. the decline of the British high street. Celebrity culture and the British high street have both been affected by the meteoric rise of the digital age. which has created a shifting retail landscape.

London. 10 December 2019. Maggie’s photograph and narrative captures the essence of her favourite white shoes and how they symbolise her experiences of being 18. Maggie chose to bring these shoes to an interview with me as they held so many memories of what it felt. for her. to be a teenager. This photograph is part of a larger research project. Shoe and Tell that explores the powerful role that shoes have in communicating and expressing teenage identity. By examining how this generation negotiates the complexity of identity. the project uses visual ethnography to flesh out teenage attitudes and experiences of everyday life. The focus of the project is shoes as they have an intimate relationship with the body. and how they feel and look on the foot influences the wearer’s physicality and their subsequent engagement with the world around them. In turn the shoe’s materiality holds the wearer’s imprint and embedded within are the memories and experiences of wearing. From tatty. mud stained. but much loved Converse. to perfect white Stan Smiths. to Doc Martens and sparkly high heels. Shoe and Tell documents the transformatory power of shoes and offers a unique perspective on the emotive. and often intriguing. life of a teenager.,True,W6d2SaMAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,0,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/38100/,,,,,0,0,0

UK. and Hong Kong.,2018,Naomi Braithwaite and Cassandra Ng,,,,,,Despite being underpinned by a consumer-driven model. fashion continues to take huge strides towards a sustainable future. This is evident through environmentally conscious practices. for example. the production of eco-conscious clothing. and. the application of circular business models. that encourage recycling and reuse. While fashion evolves. there is a still an excessive volume of clothing. unnecessarily consumed and disposed of every year. This is a global problem. compounded by the availability and affordability of new styles. encouraging consumers to acquire more stuff. The challenge for a sustainable fashion future is to transform consumer behaviour.Eighteen to twenty-five year olds are prolific consumers of fashion. and so provides a significant opportunity for exploring the consequences of consumption. with the view to initiating positive action for the future. The research takes a nuanced approach to this. by focusing specifically on fashion students. in Hong Kong and the UK.

1158855,A viable business model for fashion brands?,2018,Naomi Braithwaite and Annika Schlemann,,Eco-Friendly and Fair: Fast Fashion and Consumer Behaviour,,,Routledge,Fashion is one of the world’s most polluting industries (Greenpeace. 2016). In the UK. 350.000 tonnes of clothing are estimated to end up in landfill annually (WRAP. 2016). This is a global problem. evidenced further by the average American throwing away 80 pounds of used clothing every year. even though most of it is recyclable (LeBlanc. 2017). The materialistic values of contemporary society driven by the desire to have something new (Campbell. 1992). combined with the growth of fast fashion. where garments have become easily disposable (Birtwistle & Moore. 2007). creates the pressing need for a more sustainable approach within the industry. Fashion celebrates seasonal trends. and consumers want new and diverse wardrobes. meaning that many garments have a shorter use value. Additionally. clothes are not always designed to last. The world’s resources are finite. and a practice in which production. consumption and disposal prevails can no longer be sustained.Despite its tendency towards a linear business model of take. make and waste (Ellen MacArthur Foundation. 2014). fashion has taken strides towards sustainability. The Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP) 2020 Commitment sees fashion companies working together to reduce water. waste and carbon footprints through initiatives. which include resource efficient business models. for example reuse and recycling (WRAP. 2017). While recycling initiatives. such as those pioneered by H&M on a global scale. which has seen 32.000 tonnes of their garments given a new life since 2013 (H&M. 2017). are creating a change. they are not necessarily shifting patterns of …,True,W6d2SaMAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-31aDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT160&dq=info:qoA5bjr_4tgJ:scholar.google.com&ots=c8KusFw2Xo&sig=NXEULlyPF7fYOe9YmmrnAlerdcg,,,,,0,0,0

1158857,A conceptual framework for circular design,2016,Mariale Moreno and Carolina De los Rios and Zoe Rowe and Fiona Charnley,8,Sustainability,9,937,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Design has been recognised in the literature as a catalyst to move away from the traditional model of take-make-dispose to achieve a more restorative. regenerative and circular economy. As such. for a circular economy to thrive. products need to be designed for closed loops. as well as be adapted to generate revenues. This should not only be at the point of purchase. but also during use. and be supported by low-cost return chains and reprocessing structures. as well as effective policy and regulation. To date. most academic and grey literature on the circular economy has focused primarily on the development of new business models. with some of the latter studies addressing design strategies for a circular economy. specifically in the area of resource cycles and design for product life extension. However. these studies primarily consider a limited spectrum of the technical and biological cycles where materials are recovered and restored and nutrients (eg. materials. energy. water) are regenerated. This provides little guidance or clarity for designers wishing to design for new circular business models in practice. As such. this paper aims to address this gap by systematically analysing previous literature on Design for Sustainability (DfX)(eg. design for resource conservation. design for slowing resource loops and whole systems design) and links these approaches to the current literature on circular business models. A conceptual framework is developed for circular economy design strategies. From this conceptual framework. recommendations are made to enable designers to fully consider the holistic implications for design within a circular …,True,zTfe9fMAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C,222,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/9/937,7531842992611101232,/scholar?cites=7531842992611101232,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/9/937/pdf,0,0,0
1158858,Design for circular behaviour: Considering users in a circular economy,2018,Thomas Wastling and Fiona Charnley and Mariale Moreno,10,,6,1743,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In a linear economy. a product is manufactured and sold to a customer. Then. little concern is given to what the user actually does with it when they have it. However. in a circular economy where the aim is to circulate products at their highest level of value. the customer’s behaviour can become an important part of the system. Circular design strategies have tended to focus on the physical aspects of a product (eg. disassembly. material selection). but the design of products and services can also have an influence on user behaviour and. to date. this aspect of circular design has not been fully explored. This project aims to define what key user behaviours are required for circular business models to work and to outline how design can enable these ‘circular behaviours’. This research project consists of a literature review. case study analysis and expert interviews with practitioners. A theoretical framework for designing products and services to encourage circular behaviour is developed. This work provides an initial step towards a better understanding of the user’s role in the transition to a circular economy as well as a preliminary model for how design for behaviour change strategies could be implemented in this context.

The latest developments in the CE field have included the interrogation of CE as a paradigm. and its relationship with sustainability and other concepts. including iterative definitions. Research has also identified a significant opportunity to apply circular approaches to our rapidly changing industrial system. including manufacturing processes and Industry 4.0 (I4. 0) which. with data. is enabling the latest advances in digital technologies (DT). Research which fuses these two areas has not been extensively explored. This is the first paper to provide a synergistic and integrative CE-DT framework which offers directions for policymakers and guidance for future research through a review of the integrated fields of CE and I4. 0. To achieve this. a Systematic Literature Review (SLR; n= 174) of the empirical literature related to digital technologies. I4. 0. and circular approaches is conducted. The SLR is based on peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and early 2018. This paper also summarizes the current trends in CE research related to manufacturing. The findings confirm that while CE research has been on the increase. research on digital technologies to enable a CE is still relatively untouched.

1158861,Consumer intervention mapping—A tool for designing future product strategies within circular product service systems,2018,Matt Sinclair and Leila Sheldrick and Mariale Moreno and Emma Dewberry,10,Sustainability,6,2088,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Re-distributed manufacturing presents a number of opportunities and challenges for New Product Development in a future Circular Economy. It has been argued that small-scale. flexible and localised production systems will reduce resource consumption. lower transport emissions and extend product lifetimes. At the same time smart products within the Internet of Things will gather and report data on user behaviour and product status. Many sustainable design tools have previously been developed but few are able to imagine and develop visions of how future sustainable product service systems might be manifested. This paper introduces the concept of Consumer Intervention Mapping as a tool for creating future product strategies. The tool visualises the points within a product’s lifecycle where stakeholders are able to intervene in the product’s expected journey. This perspective enables the rapid construction of scenarios that explore and describe future circular product service systems. Validation of the tool in three workshops is described and the outcomes are presented. Consumer Intervention Mapping is successful in creating scenarios that describe existing product service systems and new product concepts adapted to a Circular Economy paradigm. Further work is required to refine the tool’s performance in more focused and reflective design exercises.

1158862,Moving Beyond the Circular Economy,2014,Mariale Moreno and Naomi Braithwaite and Tim Cooper,,,,,,The production model. which currently underpins our material prosperity. remains highly resource-intensive. and the volume of minerals. ores and fossil fuels consumed annually is set to triple by 2050 unless economic growth is decoupled from resource consumption [1]. One response that has been attracting significant attention is the idea of a circular economy (or close loop economy). in which waste is transformed into value rather than disposed of to landfill [2]. While acknowledging potential benefits to businesses of a circular economy. this paper critically reviews the model and proposes an approach that addresses concerns that even recycling processes have energy impacts through transportation. reprocessing and subsequent manufacturing. and that in practice it is impossible to have a complete circular system in which there is no use of virgin materials and no final waste. It presents an overarching framework that responds to such concerns. built by studying different circular models in a macro-level perspective and then tailoring tactics for different sectors in a micro-level perspective [3. 4. 5. 6]. The paper explains how the framework was built and how it is applied to the large household appliance (LHA) sector. through developing two emerging models based on product-service systems (PSS). The paper presents findings from a workshop in which the two models were presented to industry representatives. revealing their responses regarding the opportunities and challenges to implement the proposed models to go beyond the circular economy.,True,zTfe9fMAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,25,https://www.academia.edu/download/38526127/R-Care_Innovation_final_version-libre.pdf,1793075500553264202,/scholar?cites=1793075500553264202,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38526127/R-Care_Innovation_final_version-libre.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper. business models for re-distributed manufacture (RdM) are developed using anIDEF (Icam DEFinition for Function Modelling) description to serve as a guide for the implementation of the RdM concept in the consumer goods industry. This paper explores the viability of a re-distributed business model for manufacturers employing new manufacturing technologies such as additive manufacturing or three-dimensional (3D) printing. as part of a sustainable and circular production and consumption system. An As-Is value chain model is presented alongside the proposed new business model for a sustainable re-distributed manufacturing system. Both are illustrated via a case study drawn from the shoe manufacturing industry. The case study shows that there is a need for robust facilities in close proximity to the customer. These facilities are store fronts which can also manufacture. remanufacture. and provide services. The reduction in transportation and increase in customer involvement throughout the process are the main benefits that would accrue if a re-distributed model is implemented in the given industry.

Through this research. a remanufacturing process was mapped and simulated using discrete event simulation (DES) to depict the decision-making process at the shop-floor level of a remanufacturing facility. To understand the challenge of using data in remanufacturing. a series of interviews were conducted finding that there was a significant variability in the condition of the returned product. To address this gap. the concept of certainty of product quality (CPQ) was developed and tested through a system dynamics (SD) and DES model to better understand the effects of CPQ on products awaiting remanufacture. including inspection. cleaning and disassembly times. The wider application of CPQ could be used to forecast remanufacturing and production processes. resulting in reduced costs by using an automatised process for inspection. thus allowing more detailed distinction between “go” or “no go” for remanufacture. Within the context of a circular economy. CPQ could be replicated to assess interventions in the product lifecycle. and therefore the identification of the optimal CE strategy and the time of intervention for the current life of a product—that is. when to upgrade. refurbish. remanufacture or recycle. The novelty of this research lies in investigating the application of simulation through the lens of a restorative circular economic model focusing …,True,zTfe9fMAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,18,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/12/3379,1208750620813326855,/scholar?cites=1208750620813326855,,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/12/3379/pdf,0,0,0

The common perception is that such business models have enhanced environmental performance when compared to conventional business models rooted in the linear economy. This article investigates the environmental potential of developing a use-oriented PSS business model for Merino wool t-shirts intended for use by the British Ministry of Defence as an alternative to the present supply system based on synthetic t-shirts purchased from sportswear clothing companies. To conduct the assessment. we apply the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to quantify and compare the climate change impacts and impact potentials of the proposed PSS business model and of a reference business model. Results showed that there could be significant contribution of quantifying environmental potential for PSS business models when justifying the transition to a circular economy. However. when adopting LCA methodology for this purpose. the design of the PSS needs to be well thought to overcome some of the identified challenges. The article concludes by making the case that LCA studies can support the definition. design and value creation of the product/service-systems in early development stages.

1158868,Product longevity and shared ownership: Sustainable routes to satisfying the world’s growing demand for goods,2015,John G Rogers and Samuel JG Cooper and Simone Cooper and Danielle Densley Tingley and Naomi Braithwaite and Mariale Moreno and Alex Rodrigues and Giuseppe Salvia,3,Aims Energy,4,547-561,Aims Press,It has been estimated that by 2030 the number of people who are wealthy enough to be significant consumers will have tripled. This will have a dramatic impact on the demands for primary materials and energy. It has been estimated that with improvements in design and manufacturing it is possible to maintain the current level of production using 70% of the current primary material consumed. Even with these improvements on the production side. there will still be a doubling of primary material requirements by the end of the century. with accompanying rises in industrial energy demand. if the rise in demand for goods and  services is to be met. It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. Product longevity and using goods more intensively are two strategies which could reduce the demand for new goods. If products last longer. then manufacturing output can concentrate on emerging markets rather than the market for replacement goods. There are many goods which are infrequently used. these seldom wear out. The total demand for such could be drastically reduced if they we re shared with other people. Sharing of goods has traditionally been conducted between friends or by hiring equipment. but modern communication systems and social media could increase the opportunities to share goods. Sharing goods also increases access to a range of goods for those on low incomes. From a series of workshops it has been found that the principal challenges are sociological rather than technological.

University of the Creative Arts,This paper reports on EPSRC-funded research that explores the role of repair in creating new models of sustainable business. In the lifecycle stage of repair we explore what 'broken' means and uncover the nature of local and dispersed repair activities. This in turn allows us to better understand how the relationship between products and people can help shape new modes of consumption. Therefore. narratives of repair are collected to identify diverse people-product interactions and illustrate the different characteristics of. and motivations for. repair.   The paper proposes that mapping the different product-people interactions across the product lifecycle. particularly at the stage of fragile-functionality (performance or function failure. emotional disengagement. superseded technology) is important in understanding the potential for enduring products and their repair. Building a landscape of repair creates new opportunities for manufacture and for slowing resource loops across product lifetimes. which together provide a framework for a sufficiency-based model of production and consumption.,True,zTfe9fMAAAAJ:WqliGbK-hY8C,8,http://oro.open.ac.uk/51583/,13010805752801990203,/scholar?cites=13010805752801990203,,http://oro.open.ac.uk/51583/1/Dewberry_SI2016PaperFinal.pdf,0,0,0
1158871,Should energy labels for washing machines be expanded to include a durability rating?,2015,Naomi Braithwaite and Danielle Densley-Tingley and Mariale Moreno,,,,9-18,Nottingham Trent University: CADBE,Washing machines are a key household appliance that can be found in the majority of UK homes. Over 2.5 million are sold in the UK every year and account for one of the highest material and production impacts of householder products in the UK (WRAP. 2011). Energy efficiency ratings are provided as a method for consumers to make an informed purchasing decision and were brought in by EU legislation to reduce energy use and enable users to reduce running costs. as it is known that the greater environmental impact of a washing machine is during use. From 2014. all washing machines sold must be at a minimum A rated. with ratings increasing to A+++. However. under this current labelling system the embodied impacts and durability of the machines are ignored. Through semi-structured interviews with consumers. manufacturers and distributors. this paper explores different perceptions of longevity and expectations of performance and durability. The paper explores whether energy labels should be expanded to include durability information. as this could enable consumers to make a decision based not only on cost and energy efficiency but also on expected lifespan. Existing manufacturer’s guarantees may give an indication of the expected durability of the product and this is investigated to explore if there is a positive correlation. The findings will further discuss the potential impacts of providing durability information and how this could enable manufacturers and consumers to shift towards a low material and energy future.,True,zTfe9fMAAAAJ:WA5NYHcadZ8C,8,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/8546/,2219560969979719799,/scholar?cites=2219560969979719799,,http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/8546/1/220134_PubSub2377_Moreno.pdf,0,0,0

The work forms part of the 'Business as Unusual: Designing Products with Consumers in the Loop' [BaU] project. funded as part of the UK EPSRC-ESRC RECODE network (RECODE. 2016) that aims to explore the potential of re-distributed manufacturing (RdM) in a context of sustainability. This element of the project employed interviews. mapping and workshops as methods to investigate the relationship between people and products across the product lifecycle. A focus on product longevity and specifically the people-product interactions is captured in conversations around product maintenance and repair. In exploring ideas of ‘broken’ we found different characteristics of. and motivations for. repair. Mapping these and other product-people interactions across the product lifecycle indicated where current activity is. who owns such activity (i.e. organisation or individual) and where gaps in interactions occur. These issues were explored further in a workshop which grouped participants to look at products from the perspective of one of four scenarios; each scenario represented either short or long product lifespans and different types of people engagement in the design process.

Mont and Plepys (2008) argue that the rising levels of consumption are a result of a growing population and increasing affluence. As such. the paper first addresses the importance of sustainable consumption and defines the focus of research. Then it talks about the influence of business on consumers and refers to the need for an in-depth focus on consumers as they account for a large proportion of environmental and social impacts (Defra. 2008; Sto et al.. 2006). The paper also identifies user-centred design (UCD) as an approach that can support sustainable consumption as it is used to gain in-depth knowledge of the consumer and their context (Haines et al.. 2010; Fulton. 2004). The paper describes the initial findings of research. which aims to create a framework to help ‘business to consumer’ i.e. fast consumer goods. electronic consumer goods. e-commerce and services. to understand how UCD can be part of their strategy to enable sustainable consumption.

1158883,Consumption‐based carbon accounting: does it have a future?,2017,Stavros Afionis and Marco Sakai and Kate Scott and John Barrett and Andy Gouldson,8,,1,e438,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,Internationally. allocation of responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is currently based on the production‐based (PB) accounting method. which measures emissions generated in the place where goods and services are produced. However. the growth of emissions embodied in trade has raised the question whether we should switch to. or amalgamate PB accounting. with other accounting approaches. Consumption‐based (CB) accounting has so far emerged as the most prominent alternative.

Of particular interest is the examination of energy supply chains. given the associated risks from supply-chain issues. including availability shocks. taxes on fossil fuels and fluctuating energy prices. Using a multiregional IO (MRIO) database to calculate energy consumption-based accounts (CBA) allows analysts to both determine the quantity and source of energy embodied in products along the supply chain. However. it is recognised in the literature that there is uncertainty as to the most appropriate type of energy data that should be employed in an IO framework. Questions arise as to whether an energy extension vector should show where the energy was extracted or where it was used (burnt).

1158885,Border carbon adjustments: Addressing emissions embodied in trade,2016,Marco Sakai and John Barrett,92,Energy Policy,,102-110,Elsevier,Approximately one fourth of global emissions are embodied in international trade and a significant portion flows from non-carbon-priced to carbon-priced economies. Border carbon adjustments (BCAs) figure prominently as instruments to address concerns arising from unilateral climate policy. Estimating the volume of emissions that could be potentially taxed under a BCA scheme has received little attention until now. This paper examines how a number of issues involved in the implementation of BCAs can affect their ability to cover emissions embodied in trade and thus address carbon leakage. These issues range from ensuring compliance with trade provisions and assumptions on the carbon intensity of imports. to determining which countries are included and whether intermediate and final demand are considered.

1158886,From Theory to Econometrics to Energy Policy: Cautionary Tales for Policymaking Using Aggregate Production Functions,2017,Matthew K. Heun and João Santos and Paul E. Brockway and Randall Pruim and Tiago Domingos and Marco Sakai,10,Energies,2,1-44,MDPI,Development of energy policy is often informed by economic considerations via aggregate production functions (APFs). We identify a theory-to-policy process involving APFs comprised of six steps:(1) selecting a theoretical energy-economy framework;(2) formulating modeling approaches;(3) econometrically fitting an APF to historical economic and energy data;(4) comparing and evaluating modeling approaches;(5) interpreting the economy; and (6) formulating energy and economic policy. We find that choices made in Steps 1–4 can lead to very different interpretations of the economy (Step 5) and policies (Step 6). To investigate these effects. we use empirical data (Portugal and UK) and the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) APF to evaluate four modeling choices:(a) rejecting (or not) the cost-share principle;(b) including (or not) energy;(c) quality-adjusting (or not) factors of production; and (d) CES nesting structure. Thereafter. we discuss two revealing examples for which different upstream modeling choices lead to very different policies. In the first example. the (kl) e nesting structure implies significant investment in energy. while other nesting structures suggest otherwise. In the second example. unadjusted factors of production suggest balanced investment in labor and energy. while quality-adjusting suggests significant investment in labor over energy. Divergent outcomes provide cautionary tales for policymakers: greater understanding of upstream modeling choices and their downstream implications is needed.

1158887,Thermodynamic Efficiency Gains and their Role as a Key ‘Engine of Economic Growth’,2019,Marco Sakai and Paul E. Brockway and John R. Barrett and Peter G. Taylor,12,Energies,1,110,MDPI,Increasing energy efficiency is commonly viewed as providing a key stimulus to economic growth. through investment in efficient technologies. reducing energy use and costs. enabling productivity gains. and generating jobs. However. this view is received wisdom. as empirical validation has remained elusive. A central problem is that current energy-economy models are not thermodynamically consistent. since they do not include the transformation of energy in physical terms from primary to end-use stages. In response. we develop the UK MAcroeconometric Resource COnsumption (MARCO-UK) model. the first econometric economy-wide model to explicitly include thermodynamic efficiency and end energy use (energy services). We find gains in thermodynamic efficiency are a key ‘engine of economic growth’. contributing 25% of the increases to gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK over the period of 1971–2013. This confirms an underrecognised role for energy in enabling economic growth. We attribute most of the thermodynamic efficiency gains to endogenised technical change. We also provide new insights into how the ‘efficiency-led growth engine’mechanism works in the whole economy. Our results imply a slowdown in thermodynamic efficiency gains will constrain economic growth. whilst future energy-GDP decoupling will be harder to achieve than we suppose. This confirms the imperative for economic models to become thermodynamically consistent.

We test the explanatory power of economic. dietary and modern energy factors in accounting for past improvements in life expectancy. using a simple novel method. functional dynamic decomposition. We elucidate the paradox that a strong correlation between emissions and human development at one point in time does not imply that their dynamics are coupled in the long term.

1158890,The UK’s Emissions and Employment Footprints: Exploring the Trade-Offs,2017,Marco Sakai and Anne Owen and John Barrett,9,Sustainability,7,1-19,MDPI,During the last decades. the UK economy has increasingly relied on foreign markets to fulfil its material needs. becoming a net importer of both emissions and employment. While the emissions footprint reflects the pressure that consumption exerts on the planet’s climate. the labour footprint represents the employment that is created across the globe associated with the demand for products and services. This paper has a two-fold objective. First. it focuses on analysing the behaviour over time. drivers. and sectoral and regional composition of both UK’s footprints. Second. it explores the relationship between both measures by estimating the elasticity between the growth of emissions and employment embodied in imports. The results show that around half of the emissions associated with UK consumption were generated outside its borders. while only 40% of total employment was domestic. This has important policy implications. Reducing UK’s imports can contribute to cut both its footprints. generating less emissions abroad and more employment opportunities within. However. cutting imports is challenging. since this would require a lengthy and difficult process of structural transformation. The UK could contribute to curb emissions outside its borders. while safeguarding development overseas. by offering increased support to emission-intensive trade partners in the form of technology transfer and financial aid.

Stringer and Caroline Ward and Marco Sakai and Pedro Henrique Weirich Neto and Carlos Hugo Rocha and Jaime Alberti Gomes and Nátali Maidl de Souza and Nouman Afzal,12,Sustainability,5,2146,MDPI,Smallholders constitute more than three quarters of the world’s farmers. and despite their numbers. they commonly lack opportunities to advance their development status. Bioenergy production and consumption can help sustain smallholders’ energy needs and generate employment and income. but it also raises concerns over social justice and equity. especially where crops used for bioenergy could also be used for food. This perspective paper is grounded in a literature review related to three different crops in Brazil: sugarcane. landrace maize and sweet potato. It seeks to determine if these crops offer the potential to support smallholder farmers’ development in a more equitable way. focusing on opportunities for their use in bioenergy. We review the literature to identify policies shaping the smallholder development context in relation to these crops. assessing whose knowledge informs policy and institutional decision making. and highlighting the policy attention afforded to the different crops from different sectors. We further evaluate the literature on each crop in relation to water use and calorific value (ie. food and energy). Our review indicates that while sugarcane has received the most policy and institutional attention. its development is largely anchored in research and development investments that support large-scale commercial farms and agri-businesses. Smallholders have not benefited or had the opportunity to engage in relevant policy decision making for sugarcane cultivation.

Moreover. climate projections point to an increase in the frequency and severity of those events. Cities across the world must thus assess their vulnerabilities to extreme events and adapt accordingly. Compared to big metropolises. smaller cities face more opportunities to adapt their practices to defend and protect from these impacts. since in many cases they are still not locked-in by existing infrastructure. and show greater potential for future sustainable urban planning. Nevertheless. few studies have assessed the vulnerability of small cities. which generally present fastest population growth rates. along with lack of capacities. resources and financing options. This paper investigates the vulnerability of Ciudad del Este. Paraguay. which is expected to be among the top five fastest growing cities in Latin America by 2030. The analysis is based on a mixed methods approach. combining quantitative and qualitative techniques. Quantitatively. an Urban Vulnerability Index was built using 73 economic. social. climatic and environmental indicators. in order to quantify the sensitivity of the city to extreme weather events. as well as its capacity to cope and adapt to those events. In qualitative terms. data collected from interviews was used to complement the quantitative findings. The results show that the city is highly sensitive to extreme weather events. due to its vastly urbanised area. lack of green spaces and amount of vulnerable and exposed population.

Several initiatives have been created over recent years to engage major cities around the world to strengthen their efforts to become greener and more environmentally friendly and. at the same time. more resilient to extreme weather phenomena. while improving the living standards of their populations. This focus on cities is significantly relevant as it is expected that the majority of people in the planet will live in cities by mid-century. In the case of South America. the UN (2016) expects that around 80% of its population will be urban by 2050. Concurrently. cities are expected to increasingly face climate effects in the form of more intense and frequent extreme weather events over the years. putting at risk millions of people. especially those that are more vulnerable. Existing studies (IPCC. 2014) have shown that Latin America is particularly exposed to weather-related events and displays numerous vulnerabilities (eg poverty. economic and political instability. lack of resources and infrastructure. etc.). Based on a number of climate projections for the region developed by various teams of researchers (IPCC 2014). which show increasing trends in extreme climate variability. it is essential for Latin American countries to undertake actions to reduce their vulnerability and foster climate-resilient development.

SDGs 1 (No Poverty). 2 (Zero Hunger) and 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) are particularly crucial for the poor. given they target the basic human needs for development and fundamental human rights. The majority of poor and malnourished people in the developing world live in rural areas and engage in farming as a key part of their livelihoods. with food and agriculture at the heart of their development concerns. Crops that can provide both food and energy without detrimental impacts on soil or water resources can be particularly beneficial for local development and smallholder farmers. Sweet potato. in particular. is starting to attract growing attention from researchers and policymakers as it has the potential to address these global problems and promote a sustainable society. We systematically review the literature to assess how sweet potato can support smallholder farmers to make progress towards the SDGs. We find that sweet potato has important untapped potential to advance progress. particularly linked to its versatility as a crop and its multiple end-uses. However. further research is paramount in order to better recognise and harness its potential to address the issues of food. nutrition and energy security in the context of a changing global climate.

McGregor and Andrew G. Ross and Graeme Roy and J. Kim Swales and Karen Turner,,UKERC publication,,1-89,UKERC,Achieving the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions set out in the UK Climate Change Act will require a significant transformation in the UK's energy system. At the same time. the government is pursuing a new UK Industrial Strategy. which aims to improve labour productivity. create high-quality jobs and boost exports across the UK. The economic and the energy systems in the UK are tightly linked and so policies adopted in one area will produce spillover effects to the other. To achieve the objectives set out in the two strategies it is therefore vital to understand how the policies in the energy system will affect economic development and vice versa. This study seeks to contribute to this by investigating how an increase in exports (a key pillar in the UK Industrial Strategy) could impact energy- and industrial policy. We address this question by systematically comparing the results of two types of energy-economy models of the UK. a computable general equilibrium model and a macroeconometric model. In terms of the implications of a successful export promotion strategy. the models agree that there is likely to be a beneficial impact on the economy. but an adverse impact on CO2 emissions and energy intensity. This reveals the extent of any policy adjustment that would be required to maintain a given level of emissions and serves to emphasise the need to complement UK industrial policies with appropriate action on energy use and carbon emissions to meet statutory carbon targets set by the Climate Change Act (2008).

However. harder-to-reach fossil fuels require more energy to extract and. hence. are coming at an increasing ‘energy cost’. Associated declines in fossil fuel energy-return-on-investment ratios at first appear of little concern. given that published estimates for oil. coal and gas are typically above 25: 1. However. such ratios are measured at the primary energy stage and should instead be estimated at the final stage where energy enters the economy (for example. electricity and petrol). Here. we calculate global time series (1995–2011) energy-return-on-investment ratios for fossil fuels at both primary and final energy stages. We concur with common primary-stage estimates (~ 30: 1). but find very low ratios at the final stage: around 6: 1 and declining.

Of particular interest is the examination of energy supply chains. given the associated risks from supply-chain issues. including availability shocks. taxes on fossil fuels and fluctuating energy prices. Using a multiregional IO (MRIO) database to calculate energy consumption-based accounts (CBA) allows analysts to both determine the quantity and source of energy embodied in products along the supply chain. However. it is recognised in the literature that there is uncertainty as to the most appropriate type of energy data that should be employed in an IO framework.

This is surprising: China is the world’s largest energy consumer. whilst exergy analysis provides a robust thermodynamic framework for analysing the technical efficiency of energy use. In response. we develop three novel sub-analyses. First we perform a long-term whole economy time-series exergy analysis for China (1971–2010). We find a 10-fold growth in China’s useful work since 1971. which is supplied by a 4-fold increase in primary energy coupled to a 2.5-fold gain in aggregate exergy conversion efficiency to useful work: from 5% to 12.5%.

Stanley Jevons introduced the concept of energy rebound: that anticipated energy efficiency savings may be “taken back” by behavioural responses. This is an important issue today because. if energy rebound is significant. this would hamper the effectiveness of energy efficiency policies aimed at reducing energy use and associated carbon emissions. However. empirical studies which estimate national energy rebound are rare and. perhaps as a result. rebound is largely ignored in energy-economy models and associated policy. A significant difficulty lies in the components of energy rebound assessed in empirical studies: most examine direct and indirect rebound in the static economy. excluding potentially significant rebound of the longer term structural response of the national economy. In response. we develop a novel exergy-based approach to estimate national energy rebound for the UK and US (1980–2010) and China (1981–2010). Exergy—as “available energy”—allows a consistent. thermodynamic-based metric for national-level energy efficiency. We find large energy rebound in China. suggesting that improvements in China’s energy efficiency may be associated with increased energy consumption (“backfire”). Conversely. we find much lower (partial) energy rebound for the case of the UK and US. These findings support the hypothesis that producer-sided economies (such as China) may exhibit large energy rebound. reducing the effectiveness of energy efficiency. unless other policy measures (eg. carbon taxes) are implemented.

Firstly. it investigates to what extent changes in thermodynamic efficiency have contributed to overall changes in sectoral energy intensities. Secondly. it analyses how much of the structural change in the UK economy is driven by the offshoring of energy-intensive production overseas.

Issues that should be taken into account when making methodological options are discussed and key insights are presented: (1) For mapping of primary inputs and useful exergy categories. the inclusion of all natural resources is more consistent but it has the cost of not being able to distinguish the various energy end-uses in the production of materials.

However. in order to test these concerns on a national scale. there is a conceptual and methodological gap in relation to calculating a national-level EROI and analysing its policy implications. We address this by developing a novel application of an Input-Output methodology to calculate a national-level indirect energy investment. one of the components needed for calculating a national-level EROI. This is a mixed physical and monetary approach using Multi-Regional Input-Output data and an energy extension. We discuss some conceptual and methodological issues relating to defining EROI for a national economy. and describe in detail the methodology and data requirements for the approach. We obtain initial results for the UK for the period 1997–2012. which show that the country’s EROI has been declining since the beginning of the 21st Century. We discuss the policy relevance of measuring national-level EROI and propose avenues for future research.

We identify a theory-to-policy process involving APFs comprised of six steps:(1) selecting a theoretical energy-economy framework;(2) formulating modeling approaches;(3) econometrically fitting an APF to historical economic and energy data;(4) comparing and evaluating modeling approaches;(5) interpreting the economy; and (6) formulating energy and economic policy. We find that choices made in Steps 1–4 can lead to very different interpretations of the economy (Step 5) and policies (Step 6). To investigate these effects. we use empirical data (Portugal and UK) and the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) APF to evaluate four modeling choices:(a) rejecting (or not) the cost-share principle;(b) including (or not) energy;(c) quality-adjusting (or not) factors of production; and (d) CES nesting structure. Thereafter. we discuss two revealing examples for which different upstream modeling choices lead to very different policies. In the first example. the (kl) e nesting structure implies significant investment in energy. while other nesting structures suggest otherwise. In the second example. unadjusted factors of production suggest balanced investment in labor and energy. while quality-adjusting suggests significant investment in labor over energy. Divergent outcomes provide cautionary tales for policymakers: greater understanding of upstream modeling choices and their downstream implications is needed.

1158916,Thermodynamic Efficiency Gains and their Role as a Key ‘Engine of Economic Growth’,2019,Marco Sakai and Paul E Brockway and John R Barrett and Peter G Taylor,12,Energies,1,1-14,MDPI. Open Access Journal,Increasing energy efficiency is commonly viewed as providing a key stimulus to economic growth. through investment in efficient technologies. reducing energy use and costs. enabling productivity gains. and generating jobs. However. this view is received wisdom. as empirical validation has remained elusive. A central problem is that current energy-economy models are not thermodynamically consistent. since they do not include the transformation of energy in physical terms from primary to end-use stages. In response. we develop the UK MAcroeconometric Resource COnsumption (MARCO-UK) model. the first econometric economy-wide model to explicitly include thermodynamic efficiency and end energy use (energy services). We find gains in thermodynamic efficiency are a key ‘engine of economic growth’. contributing 25% of the increases to gross domestic product (GDP) in the UK over the period of 1971–2013. This confirms an underrecognised role for energy in enabling economic growth. We attribute most of the thermodynamic efficiency gains to endogenised technical change. We also provide new insights into how the ‘efficiency-led growth engine’mechanism works in the whole economy. Our results imply a slowdown in thermodynamic efficiency gains will constrain economic growth. whilst future energy-GDP decoupling will be harder to achieve than we suppose. This confirms the imperative for economic models to become thermodynamically consistent.

The question is. how much of the resource available in cities is effectively utilized? In response. this paper develops an ecological-thermodynamic approach to assess the ability of a system to make full use of the resources available and reduce the demand for new resources. In this work. open system network effectiveness analysis is introduced as a novel assessment method to investigate the cities’ producer and consumer behaviors by studying the resource flow connections and the interactions between the socio-economic sectors. Investigation on the urban flows network evaluates the ability of the system to utilize the resource imported through the effectiveness of utilization indicator and the ability to convert the resource …,True,MVtq61AAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919312929,1989228319303372676,/scholar?cites=1989228319303372676,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261919312929,0,0,0
1158927,Carbon measurement in the NHS: Calculating the first consumption-based total carbon footprint of an NHS Trust.,2009,Paul Brockway,,,,,,In January 2009 a national NHS England carbon reduction strategy (SDU. 2009a) was launched. It is believed to be the first public sector organisation worldwide to publish a carbon strategy based on the embedded emissions of all its activities: a consumption-based approach. The strategy sets a target for 2015 to reduce NHS England’s total consumption-based emissions from travel. building energy and procurement sectors to 10% below the 2007 level of 20.0MtCO2 (SEI and Arup. 2009a).   At the local level. NHS Trusts currently measure building energy emissions and in some cases staff travel emissions. but do not include procurement. This omission is important. as procurement is estimated to account for 60% of NHS England emissions. Therefore. as none of the NHS Trusts in England have undertaken a consumption-based footprint. they have no means of baselining all emissions and checking individual progress towards the national target. A gap therefore exists between NHS England targets and the measurement tools available at an NHS Trust level.   This research seeks to explore this gap. Firstly. the consumption-based carbon footprint of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust was calculated. and determined to be 168.902tCO2 in 2007. A similar methodology was used to that developed for the NHS England carbon footprint study (SDC. 2008). except importantly bottom-up data was obtained directly from the NHS Trust. By reviewing the results. and comparing them to those for NHS England. the footprinting technique appears technically viable for use at an NHS Trust level.

Currently. little is known about factors which have driven regional air-conditioning (AC) energy consumption over time. since the literature is limited to cross-sectional studies that lack differentiation between climatic and non-climatic influences. Future projections for the EU's electricity sector may therefore neglect the potential implications of rapidly growing AC demand.

Honduras. like many low and medium Human Development Index countries. depends on primary solid biofuels for more than 30% of its primary energy supply (as of 2013). We conducted a societal exergy analysis and developed a forest stock model for Honduras for 1971–2013 and used the results to model an energy transition from traditional wood stoves to either improved efficiency wood cookstoves or modern fuel cookstoves (using Electricity or Liquefied petroleum gas) over the period 2013–2050. The exergy analysis and forest model enabled quantification of the environmental tradeoffs between the improved efficiency and fuel switching scenarios. We find that the continued reliance on wood within both the existing and improved wood cookstove scenarios would exhaust forest stocks by 2050. though improved efficiency could reduce national greenhouse gas emissions. Modern fuel cookstoves would reduce household air pollution. emissions. and deforestation. However. the best alternative to successfully reduce household air pollution.

1158946,Defrost cycle performance for a circular shape evaporator air source heat pump,2008,Neil Hewitt and Ming Jun Huang,31,International Journal of Refrigeration,3,444-452,Elsevier,Air source heat pumps have numerous advantages in many applications over other heating equipment with regard to energy efficiency. However. there are two main problems with air source heat pumps: (1) heating capacity decreases when the outdoor air temperature becomes lower and (2) when there is frost formation on the outdoor heat exchanger surfaces in humid climates. This paper will examine the defrost cycle for a residential heat pump with circular shaped evaporator coil in more detail paying special attention to the high humidity conditions encountered in maritime climates. The investigation was to optimise the efficiency of an air source heat pump operating under a range of conditions that would include defrost.

On the one hand. the idea of civil society has been likened to a renaissance and is often considered to be the most likely route out of development ‘problems’. particularly in the poor countries. Dominant development discourses have scripted the liberal interpretation of civil society as the only game in town. However. on the other hand. as a consequence of growing criticism on the failure of top-down development approach in the late-1960s. and throughout most of the 1970s. there was a sudden upsurge of interest that ordinary citizens might have a part to play in the development process.

In doing so. it offers a critical review of poverty scholarship to assess the notion of extreme poverty adopted in the SDGs. This also takes stock of past global anti-poverty programmes to set an appropriate context for forecasting potential challenges to eradicate poverty everywhere. It is highlighted that i) a number of poor countries will have to perform a magic against their track records. ii) the world needs to be consistently peaceful. iii) significant and equitable reform should take place within world economic structure. iv) quality and international comparability of poverty data in poor countries need to be improved significantly. and v) uncertainty about required investment in poor countries should be addressed rigorously in order for achieving poverty eradication target of the SDGs. These lead to the argument that without strong political commitments by all related stakeholders and an approach to look beyond existing models poverty eradication target may turn out to be another statement of good intentions by the international aid architecture with little meaningful practical relevance.,True,pF7PEwwAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,11,http://ecsdev.org/ojs/index.php/ejsd/article/view/320,14925472651262323689,/scholar?cites=14925472651262323689,,https://ecsdev.org/ojs/index.php/ejsd/article/download/320/317,0,0,0

However. the reality is. national elites comprised of politicians and (former) military personnel. have been the principle beneficiaries of oil revenues in contrast to local communities who so far seen little or no benefits. In Nigeria. prior to the discovery of oil. exploration of natural resources was primarily controlled by the regional authorities. This later altered in a way (such as Land Use Act 1978; and Decree 13. 1996) that dispossessed local people from the rights to land ownership paving the grounds for petro-capitalism’1. This can be seen as one of the key factors for various aspects of grievances (Onuoha. 2005; Oluwanyi. 2010; Obi. 2009). and feeling of marginalisation among the local communities (Tamuno. 1970; Odukoya. 2006). particularly for the ethnic groups such as Ijaws and Ogonis.

1158974,Civil society in the global South,2019,P. (ed) Kamruzzaman,,,,,,In recent years civil society has been seen as a key route for democracy promotion and solving development ‘problems’ in low-income countries. However. the very concept of civil society is deeply rooted in European traditions and values. In pursuing civil society reform in non-Western countries. many scholars along with well-meaning international agencies and donor organisations fail to account for non-Western values and historical experiences. Civil Society in the Global South seeks to redress this balance by offering diverse accounts of civil society from the global South. authored by scholars and researchers who are reflecting on their observations of civil society in their own countries. The countries studied in the volume range from across Africa. Latin America. Asia and the Middle East to give a rich account of how countries from the global south conceptualise and construct civil society. The book demonstrates how local conditions are often unsuited to the ideal type of civil society as delineated in Western values. for instance in cases where numerous political. racial and ethnic sub-groups are ‘fighting’for autonomy. By disentangling local contexts of countries from across the global South. this book demonstrates that it is important to view civil society through the lens of local conditions. rather than viewing it as something that needs to be ‘discovered’or ‘manufactured’in non-Western societies. Civil Society in the Global South will be particularly useful to high-level students and scholars within development studies. sociology. anthropology. social policy. politics. international relations and human geography.,True,pF7PEwwAAAAJ:hFOr9nPyWt4C,3,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iah8DwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PT24&dq=info:9ogfUT2IxbYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lK5zA7G42j&sig=_bXYO4r_d9As7509FXGCVYKySsU,13170082482250287350,/scholar?cites=13170082482250287350,,https://www.academia.edu/download/59729598/2018_CL_Civil_society_in_Mexico_from_theory_to_practice_AOR20190614-117321-15ykpwd.PDF,0,0,0

Regulation and Justice,2010,Gabe Mythen and Palash Kamruzzaman,,Regulation and Criminal Justice: Innovations in Policy and Research,,211-234,Cambridge University Press,Since the 9/11 attacks in Washington and New York. national security issues have risen sharply up the political agenda in many western nation states (see Amoore and de Goede 2008; McGhee 2008; Vedby Rasmussen 2008; Zedner 2005). Post-9/11 a cluster of incidents. including bombings in Istanbul. the Madrid train explosions and the 7/7 attacks in London have fixed the terrorist risk as a critical social concern. Despite the fact that political violence is a historically omnipresent phenomenon. the attacks committed by supporters of al-Qaeda have reconfigured not just the perceived level of the threat in the UK but also the scope of legal measures taken to tackle terrorism (see Bonner 2008; Lambert 2008). In recent years. terrorism has become ubiquitous in political and media discourse. being emblematic of the fears and uncertainties that characterize the ‘risk society’(see Beck 2009; Mythen 2008). Of course. it is easy to see why ‘global’terrorism has become such a focal issue. Not only are international terrorist attacks unpredictable and sizeable in scale. they effectively disrobe the claim that the state is able to secure safety and security for its citizens.The regulatory responses to 9/11 and 7/7 have had wide-ranging impacts on Muslims living in the UK. Following on from these incidents. Muslim minority groups have been subject to intensified modes of monitoring. surveillance and intervention by crime and security agencies. The introduction of multiple forms of security regulation has been underscored by media and political discourses that have cast British Muslims as suspect and dangerous (see Pantazis and Pemberton 2008: 15).

1158992,Educational and occupational mobility across generations in India: social and regional dimensions,2010,Jhilam Ray and Rajarshi Majumder,53,,,,,Educational and Occupational Mobility is a cherished dream for all groups of people. more so for those who are at the bottom rungs of society. However. it is often seen that upward mobility is concentrated among the socially well-offs leading to divergence in educational attainment and occupational levels. Such divergence is reflected in earning capabilities as well. thereby aggravating the problems of economic and social inequality. The present paper examines the extent of intergenerational mobility in both educational and occupational attainments for diverse social groups in India to understand the inertia of inequality. A regional dimension is also explored to examine whether patterns are similar or otherwise across the country. Results indicate strong intergenerational stickiness in both educational achievement and occupational distribution among the backward social groups.

Recent Evidence from Indian Labour Market,2014,Nandini Mukherjee and Jhilam Ray,,,,,,Acknowledging women as economic agents with their direct contribution to growth continues to remain the focus of  the nation among it’s various objectives even in the Twelfth Plan which suggest various ways of making economic growth truly inclusive . In order to be inclusive the nature and the composition of  growth should be such that it should include the poor. particularly the excluded/ marginalised group like women and the disadvantaged socio-economic group. If women lack sufficient decent work opportunities and continue to remain excluded from the main stream economy and cannot contribute to the development process  as economic agents for a considerable period of time then can have serious implications for future growth of Indian economy. In India recently there is a debate regarding  “Missing female labour”  where some portrayed this decline as a positive effect due to rising participation in education among young females and others claim that it was crowding-out of female labour in the face of agricultural stagnation and slowdown of economic growth. The  objective of the present  paper is to investigate the present status of households headed by female  in rural and urban India and examine  their demographic structure and employment pattern in comparison to male headed households using unit level data of NSSO employment and Unemployment (68th Round).

1158998,Development and Exclusion: Intergenerational Stickiness in India,2016,Rajarshi Majumder and Jhilam Ray,,,,,,The concept of development has matured from being indicative of aggregative progress to being sensitive to inequality and exclusion within the whole. giving rise to the coinage Inclusive Development. This notion speaks of bridging gap between ethnic/social groups within a nation in domains like livelihood. social status. political empowerment. cultural freedom. among others. This would depend on temporal movement of different groups and intergenerational mobility can act as a mechanism to achieve social fluidity and greater inclusion. Present paper explores the role of intergenerational stickiness in perpetuating such disparity across social groups in India. We argue that economic status is intricately linked to what a person does for livelihood. i.e. her occupation. and what remuneration she receives for it. i.e. her wages. In present world system. occupation and wages are also critically determined by the human capital quotient of the individual. marked generally by her educational level. Therefore. the socioeconomic structure of a country and its temporal movement would be shaped by intergenerational mobility in education. occupation and income for different social groups. Higher (upward) mobility for the lagging classes would lead to catching up and convergence while lower mobility for them would lead to widening gaps. It is our contention that persistence of economic inequality across social groups in India is associated with high parental impact and low intergenerational mobility for the historically lagging and excluded social groups.

1159002,Wages & income mobility in Indian labour market: the post-reform scenario,2012,Jhilam Ray and Rajarshi Majumder,,,,,,Improvement in the living conditions of workers is an important objective of development planners and India is no exception. The crux of this lies in returns from work. or wage level. While non-wage aspects are important. wage level is the most pertinent indicator of condition of workers and increase in real wage level signals improvement in condition of labour market. Though most studies compare wages at different points of time from cross-sectional data. they provide an aggregative view without control for variables that are particular to the household/family. Contrary to this. intergenerational mobility in wage income following life cycle theory observes direction & quantum of movement of workers’ wage relative to their parents. therefore filtering out household characteristics. and providing better measure of workers’ conditions and its trends over time. Another important aspect that can be explored by looking at intergenerational wage mobility is related to the issue of equality. Stickiness of wage income with respect to parental income leads to persistence of income inequality across generations and questions the notional objective of equity in opportunity and openness of any society.  Historically some groups are belonging to lower strata of society due to economic and or social discrimination leading to lower  income and  asset possession as well as capability formation which excluded them from  the process of capability formation and income-earning.

Key to reaping this demographic dividend lies in using the working age population to fullest potential and enhance production to the maximum possible. However. this can become a nightmare if skill demand and supply in the labour market do not match. keeping large portion of the working age population out of productive engagement while at the same time some productive sectors suffer from labour shortage in key areas. In this paper we look at the issue of estimating skill gap in the Indian labour market starting with the methods currently available globally. It then attempts to project both future labour demand and labour supply by sector and skill group and study the expected surplus/shortages in labour market. Results indicate that methodologies are still in the nascent stage and surplus and shortages are likely to coexist in the labour market. While some specific skills are scarce. others are in surplus. indicating the importance of taking a hard look at the manpower policy. including the education policy.

With almost half the population lagging behind. this acts as a drag on the overall HDI.

It has rediscovered that human beings are both the means and the end of economic development process. and without Human Development that process becomes a hollow rhetoric. The maze of technical concepts and growth centric approach to development ruled the roost for the most of post war period and only from the eighties onwards did the intelligentsia started to recognize that human needs and capabilities are necessary ingredients for success of any growth strategy. The pioneering work of Mahbub ul Haq and Paul Streeten under the aegis of UNDP finally institutionalised the importance of human development and the Human Development Reports brought out annually by UNDP reflects the condition of human being in different parts of the world. It has come to be recognised that improvements of human beings – their capabilities. skills and opportunities – are important targets by themselves. Moreover. this has substantial ‘spill over’ effects as greater capabilities lead to higher productivity levels. increased income levels. and wider scope for further human capital formation. Thus uplifting of a single generation of citizen propels all future generations on to a higher growth trajectory. The ‘trickle down’ effects also are significant as better living standards lead to greater care for the environment & resources. a healthy & democratic civic society. and a lower discrimination based on gender. race and caste.

1159018,Network science based quantification of resilience demonstrated on the Indian Railways Network,2015,Udit Bhatia and Devashish Kumar and Evan Kodra and Auroop R Ganguly,10,PloS one,11,e0141890,Public Library of Science,The structure. interdependence. and fragility of systems ranging from power-grids and transportation to ecology. climate. biology and even human communities and the Internet have been examined through network science. While response to perturbations has been quantified. recovery strategies for perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science based quantitative framework for measuring. comparing and interpreting hazard responses as well as recovery strategies. The framework. motivated by the recently proposed temporal resilience paradigm. is demonstrated with the Indian Railways Network. Simulations inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as well as a cyber-physical attack scenario illustrate hazard responses and effectiveness of proposed recovery strategies. Multiple metrics are used to generate various recovery strategies. which are simply sequences in which system components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of these strategies suggests that faster and more efficient recovery is possible through network centrality measures. Optimal recovery strategies may be different per hazard. per community within a network. and for different measures of partial recovery. In addition. topological characterization provides a means for interpreting the comparative performance of proposed recovery strategies. The methods can be directly extended to other Large-Scale Critical Lifeline Infrastructure Networks including transportation. water. energy and communications systems that are …,True,tYqY-VoAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,64,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141890,7922131323437292894,/scholar?cites=7922131323437292894,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141890,0,0,0

Extreme events and stresses. including those that may be unprecedented but are no longer surprising. have disproportionate effects on critical infrastructures and hence on communities. cities. and megaregions. Critical infrastructures include buildings and bridges. dams. levees. and sea walls. as well as power plants and chemical factories. besides lifeline networks such as multimodal transportation. power grids. communication. and water or wastewater. The growing interconnectedness of natural-built-human systems causes cascading infrastructure failures and necessitates simultaneous recovery. This text explores the new paradigm centered on the concept of resilience by approaching the challenges posed by globalization. climate change. and growing urbanization on critical infrastructures and key resources through the combination of policy and engineering perspectives. It identifies solutions that are scientifically credible. data driven. and sound in engineering principles while concurrently informed by and supportive of social and policy imperatives.

The multiplier effect of ensembles from emissions-trajectories. multiple-models and initial-conditions contribute to the challenge.

This shared language is necessary to bridge a divide between these disciplines’ different conceptual frameworks. As a result of this workshop. we argue that we should view socio-hydrological systems as structurally coconstituted of social. engineered. and natural elements and study the “characteristic management challenges” that emerge from this structure and reoccur across time. space. and socioeconomic contexts. This approach is in contrast to theories that view these systems as separately conceptualized natural and social domains connected by bi-directional feedbacks. as is prevalent in much of the water systems research arising from the physical sciences. A focus on emergent characteristic management challenges encourages us to go beyond searching for evidence of feedbacks and instead ask questions such as: What types of innovations have successfully been used to address these challenges? What structural components of the system affect its resilience to hydrological events and through what mechanisms? Are there differences between successful and unsuccessful strategies to solve one of the characteristic management challenges? If so. how are these differences affected by institutional structure and ecological and economic contexts? To answer these questions. social processes must now take center stage in the study and practice of water management.

Ecosystems characterized primarily by mutualistic relationships between species such as plant-pollinator interactions may be particularly vulnerable to such perturbations because the loss of biodiversity can cause extinction cascades that can compromise the entire network. Here. we develop a general restoration strategy based on network-science for degraded ecosystems. Specifically. we show that network topology can be used to identify the optimal sequence of species reintroductions needed to maximize biodiversity gains following partial and full ecosystem collapse. This restoration strategy generalizes across topologically-disparate and geographically-distributed ecosystems. Additionally. we find that although higher connectance and diversity promote persistence in pristine ecosystems. these attributes reduce the effectiveness of restoration efforts in degraded networks. Hence. focusing on restoring the factors that promote persistence in pristine ecosystems may yield suboptimal recovery strategies for degraded ecosystems.

While the models have generated useful information about global warming and hydrology.“the sad truth of climate science is that the most crucial information is the least credible”(Schiermeier 2010). The possible reasons include intrinsic variability of the climate system as well as our lack of understanding of the physics and the inability to include known physics within the current generation of computer models. Data sciences. ranging from statistics and signal processing to machine learning and nonlinear dynamics. continue to help fill some of the crucial gaps in climate. We hypothesize that these data science solutions can be improved if they are driven by physical knowledge. especially when this knowledge cannot be incorporated in current climate models because they are incomplete or incompatible. We have called this paradigm Physics-Guided Data Mining (PGDM)(Ganguly et al. 2014). In addition to motivating and introducing PGDM. this chapter presents three case studies on precipitation. based on our prior work. Statistical downscaling. which generates higher-resolution projections from lower-resolution model simulations. benefits from a blend of sparse learning techniques with physically motivated covariates (Das et al. 2014; 2015).

Indian cities have undergone an unprecedented rate of growth in the past 30 years (Taubenbock et al.. 2009). In 2018. around 34% of the total population in India lived in Urban areas (World Urbanization Prospects—Population Division—United NationsDocument. 2018). United Nations predictions show that. by 2025. Delhi would be the most populated city in the world. and Mumbai would be the sixth in the list. The massive growing population necessitated the need for extensive infrastructure. preserving the physical and environmental milieu of the city. The vast scale of these urban systems and their complex networks make them vulnerable to any natural or human-made attacks. India is most imperiled to natural hazards and also not unknown to humanmade disasters. Experience attests that any attack on urban infrastructure cripples the city and halts life for days. be it 2012 India Blackout. which left half of the Indian population without electricity. or 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods. which killed more than 1000 people and ruined infrastructure (Bhatia et al.. 2015; Bhatt et al.. 2013). A similar catastrophe happened in Mumbai in 2005. where the city witnessed one of its worst floods in the history of India—having an area of 437 km2 and around 12 million population. Mumbai reached to complete halt owing to unparalleled rainfall of 994 mm in just 24 h (Gupta. 2020). The rain paralyzed the city. Almost all the services such as transportation. telecommunications. and power came to an absolute standstill.

1159041,Flood evacuation during pandemic: a multi-objective framework to handle compound hazard,2021,Shrabani S Tripathy and Udit Bhatia and Mohit P Mohanty and Subhankar Karmakar and Subimal Ghosh,,Environmental Research Letters,,,IOP Publishing,The evacuation of the population from flood-affected regions is a non-structural measure to mitigate flood hazards. Shelters used for this purpose usually accommodate a large number of flood evacuees for a temporary period. Floods during a pandemic result in a compound hazard. Evacuations under such situations are difficult to plan as social distancing is nearly impossible in the highly crowded shelters. This results in a multi-objective problem with conflicting objectives of maximizing the number of evacuees from flood-prone regions and minimizing the number of infections at the end of the shelter's stay. To the best of our knowledge. such a problem is yet to be explored in literature. Here we develop a simulation-optimization framework. where multiple objectives are handled with a max-min approach.

Previous studies suggest that the “state of the art” methods can be enhanced by exploiting relevant information from radar and numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. using process physics and data-dictated tools where each fits best. Tests indicate that improved results are obtained by decomposing the overall problem into component processes. and that each process may require alternative tools ranging from simple interpolation to statistical time series models and artificial neural networks (ANNs).

However. contemporary Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling. a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical modeling choices. downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling.

1159062,Detection and predictive modeling of chaos in finite hydrological time series,2005,Shiraj Khan and Auroop R Ganguly and Sunil Saigal,12,Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics,1,41-53,Copernicus GmbH, The ability to detect the chaotic signal from a finite time series observation of hydrologic systems is addressed in this paper. The presence of random and seasonal components in hydrological time series. like rainfall or runoff. makes the detection process challenging. Tests with simulated data demonstrate the presence of thresholds. in terms of noise to chaotic-signal and seasonality to chaotic-signal ratios. beyond which the set of currently available tools is not able to detect the chaotic component. The investigations also indicate that the decomposition of a simulated time series into the corresponding random. seasonal and chaotic components is possible from finite data. Real streamflow data from the Arkansas and Colorado rivers are used to validate these results. Neither of the raw time series exhibits chaos. While a chaotic component can be extracted from the Arkansas data. such a component is either not present or can not be extracted from the Colorado data. This indicates that real hydrologic data may or may not have a detectable chaotic component. The strengths and limitations of the existing set of tools for the detection and modeling of chaos are also studied.,True,eNrAUJMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,70,https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/12/41/2005/,4700883449546205676,/scholar?cites=4700883449546205676,,https://npg.copernicus.org/articles/12/41/2005/npg-12-41-2005.pdf,0,0,0

While response to perturbations has been quantified. recovery strategies for perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science based quantitative framework for measuring. comparing and interpreting hazard responses as well as recovery strategies. The framework. motivated by the recently proposed temporal resilience paradigm. is demonstrated with the Indian Railways Network. Simulations inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as well as a cyber-physical attack scenario illustrate hazard responses and effectiveness of proposed recovery strategies. Multiple metrics are used to generate various recovery strategies. which are simply sequences in which system components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of these strategies suggests that faster and more efficient recovery is possible through network centrality measures. Optimal recovery strategies may be different per hazard. per community within a network. and for different measures of partial recovery. In addition. topological characterization provides a means for interpreting the comparative performance of proposed recovery strategies.

The EMD technique is applied to decompose a noisy sensor signal into the so-called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). These functions are of the same length and in the same time domain as the original signal. Therefore. the EMD technique preserves varying frequency in time. Assuming the given signal is corrupted by high-frequency (HF) Gaussian noise implies that most of the noise should be captured by the first few modes. Therefore. our proposition is to separate the modes into HF and low-frequency (LF) groups. We applied an information-theoretic method. namely. mutual information to determine the cutoff for separating the modes. A denoising procedure is applied only to the HF group using a shrinkage approach.

Within and across these services. in order to provide optimal delivery of health services. teams must be coordinated to provide optimal care. Although many disciplines study teamwork as a result. it is unclear how scholars and clinicians conceptualize. study. and apply these processes. The current systematic review investigates how these fields (1) study teams through the application of a teamwork processes rubric and (2) distinguish themselves from other medical disciplines through the empirical research. We draw upon Marks et al. (2001) and LePine et al. (2008)’s taxonomy of teamwork processes. operationalizing transition. action. and interpersonal processes. to guide this work. Overall. the dynamic domains of literature studied teamwork processes at high rates. relative to other medical fields. Specifically. they were strongly associated with transition and action processes and the content areas of leadership and performance.

Using a longitudinal design. we found that study abroad students who had a close friend accompanying them on the experience (i.e.. an “international study buddy”) had lower cultural agility at the onset of the experience but had a higher level of cultural agility development upon return. compared with those without a friend on the trip. Those who did not travel with friends demonstrated no significant cross-cultural competency development.

Not the Product: A Meta-Analytic Investigation of the Relationships Between Team Demographic Diversity and Team Processes,2019,Allison Marie Traylor,,,,,,The past half-century has been characterized by a rise in teamwork that has aligned with shifting demographic characteristics reflecting the world’s aging and increasingly diverse population. As a result. organizations and researchers alike have shifted their attention toward understanding the conditions under which team demographic diversity can facilitate or hinder team performance. In response to recent calls to examine the emergent processes and contextual factors impacting the team diversity-performance relationship. I conducted a meta-analytic investigation of the team diversity-process relationship that emphasizes the role of context in shaping these effects. This research contributes to the broader literature on team demographic diversity in several important ways. First. it integrates theory on team diversity through a framework emphasizing the roles of context. information elaboration. and social categorization to organize previous investigations of team processes. Second. it integrates research on gender. age. and racial diversity with research on nationality diversity. areas which have previously been studied separately. Third. it tests—and finds support for—the notion that team diversity may differentially impact team processes. indicating that the overall effect of team diversity on performance may be washed out by the differential effects of diversity on interpersonal and action processes.

In the face of these pressures. teamwork has become both more important and more challenging. Fortunately. numerous examples of naturally occurring cooperation are appearing at healthcare institutions around the globe. including instances of people trying to work together during the crisis who may not have done so under ‘normal’conditions. A crisis can stimulate some people’s willingness to cooperate. for example. to ignore prior disagreements to tackle a shared predicament. But even when the intent to cooperate is present. the incessant stress present during a crisis makes it significantly harder for teams to sustain coordinated performance over time. 1 2 Focused attention on teamwork is required. 3Prior research conducted on teams under stress can be used to help anticipate risk points that can adversely impact teamwork and reveal what can be done to help teams coordinate effectively. maintain resilience and ensure patient safety during the pandemic. This article offers several evidence-based recommendations to help clinical teams that work directly with patients during COVID-19 and in future crises.

While response to perturbations has been quantified. recovery strategies for perturbed networks have usually been either discussed conceptually or through anecdotal case studies. Here we develop a network science based quantitative framework for measuring. comparing and interpreting hazard responses as well as recovery strategies. The framework. motivated by the recently proposed temporal resilience paradigm. is demonstrated with the Indian Railways Network. Simulations inspired by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and the 2012 North Indian blackout as well as a cyber-physical attack scenario illustrate hazard responses and effectiveness of proposed recovery strategies. Multiple metrics are used to generate various recovery strategies. which are simply sequences in which system components should be recovered after a disruption. Quantitative evaluation of these strategies suggests that faster and more efficient recovery is possible through network centrality measures. Optimal recovery strategies may be different per hazard. per community within a network. and for different measures of partial recovery. In addition. topological characterization provides a means for interpreting the comparative performance of proposed recovery strategies.

However. climate internal variability (CIV) is thought to be relatively important at near-term (0-30 year) prediction horizons. especially at higher resolutions. The recent availability of significant numbers of multi-model (MME) and multi-initial condition (MICE) ensembles allows for the first time a direct sensitivity analysis of CIV versus model response variability (MRV). Understanding the relative agreement and variability of MME and MICE ensembles for multiple regions. resolutions. and projection horizons is critical for focusing model improvements. diagnostics. and prognosis. as well as impacts. adaptation. and vulnerability studies. Here we find that CIV (MICE agreement) is lower (higher) than MRV (MME agreement) across all spatial resolutions and projection time horizons for both temperature and precipitation. However. CIV dominates MRV over higher latitudes generally and in specific regions. Furthermore. CIV is considerably larger than MRV for precipitation compared to temperature across all horizontal and projection scales and seasons. Precipitation exhibits larger uncertainties. sharper decay of MICE agreement compared to MME. and relatively greater dominance of CIV over MRV at higher latitudes.

1159105,Water stress on us power production at decadal time horizons,2015,Poulomi Ganguli and Devashish Kumar and Auroop R Ganguly,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08449,,,,Thermoelectric power production at risk. owing to current and projected water scarcity and rising stream temperatures. is assessed for the contiguous United States at decadal scales. Regional water scarcity is driven by climate variability and change. as well as by multi-sector water demand. While a planning horizon of zero to about thirty years is occasionally prescribed by stakeholders. the challenges to risk assessment at these scales include the difficulty in delineating decadal climate trends from intrinsic natural or multiple model variability. Current generation global climate or earth system models are not credible at the spatial resolutions of power plants. especially for surface water quantity and stream temperatures. which further exacerbates the assessment challenge. Population changes. which are difficult to project. cannot serve as adequate proxies for changes in the water demand across sectors. The hypothesis that robust assessments of power production at risk are possible. despite the uncertainties. has been examined as a proof of concept. An approach is presented for delineating water scarcity and temperature from climate models. observations and population storylines. as well as for assessing power production at risk by examining geospatial correlations of power plant locations within regions where the usable water supply for energy production happens to be scarcer and warmer. Our analyses showed that in the near term. more than 200 counties are likely to be exposed to water scarcity in the next three decades. Further. we noticed that stream gauges in more than five counties in the 2030s and ten counties in the 2040s showed …,True,dGkyp9IAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08449,15179748529354644024,/scholar?cites=15179748529354644024,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.08449,0,0,0

While the models have generated useful information about global warming and hydrology.“the sad truth of climate science is that the most crucial information is the least credible”(Schiermeier 2010). The possible reasons include intrinsic variability of the climate system as well as our lack of understanding of the physics and the inability to include known physics within the current generation of computer models. Data sciences. ranging from statistics and signal processing to machine learning and nonlinear dynamics. continue to help fill some of the crucial gaps in climate. We hypothesize that these data science solutions can be improved if they are driven by physical knowledge. especially when this knowledge cannot be incorporated in current climate models because they are incomplete or incompatible. We have called this paradigm Physics-Guided Data Mining (PGDM)(Ganguly et al. 2014). In addition to motivating and introducing PGDM. this chapter presents three case studies on precipitation. based on our prior work. Statistical downscaling. which generates higher-resolution projections from lower-resolution model simulations. benefits from a blend of sparse learning techniques with physically motivated covariates (Das et al. 2014; 2015). Multimodal uncertainty quantification shows the potential to improve when physical relations with ancillary variables are considered together with historical skills and future consensus. within a Bayesian framework (Ganguly et al. 2013; Kodra 2014a; Smith et al. 2009).

Amazon introduced spot instances to offer their unused resources at lower cost with reduced reliability. Amazon’s spot instances allow customers to bid on unused Amazon EC2 capacity and run those instances for as long as their bid exceeds the current spot price. The spot price changes periodically based on supply and demand of spot instances. and customers whose bid exceeds it gain access to the available spot instances. Customers may expect their services at lower cost with spot instances compared to on-demand or reserved. However the reliability is compromised since the instances (IaaS) providing the service (SaaS) may become unavailable at any time without any notice to the customer. In this paper. we study various checkpointing schemes to increase the reliability over spot instances.

WSN consists of densely deployed sensor nodes in the area which is to be sensed or monitored. Each sensor node is a tiny and power constrained device which is assigned the task of monitoring. Sensor networks have a very wide range of application and so they are much in demand. Every tiny sensor node needs to transmit the sensed data to more powerful sink nodes or base station. Thus as communication is an important aspect of WSN. so the underlying technologies being used should also be competent enough to enable better functionalities. This paper deals WSN technologies.

Recently the use of multiple sinks instead of single is considered as a research topic for energy saving. The objective is to maximize the network lifetime by reducing distance from source node to sink during data transmission. This paper proposes a network partitioning algorithm based on selection of farthest node from k-Nearest Neighbour Graph.

In order to enable adaptive execution of multiple jobs running concurrently in a computational grid. we propose an integrated performance-based resource management framework that is supported by a multi-agent system (MAS). The multi-agent system initially allocates the jobs onto different resource providers based on a resource selection algorithm. Later. during runtime. if performance of any job degrades or quality of service cannot be maintained for some reason (resource failure or overloading). the multi-agent system assists the job to adapt to the system.

One scheme is manual (performed by the programmer). the other three are automatic (performed entirely by software). The performance of code generated for two parallel computers from seven different test cases is compared. and reasons for differences in achieved performance between the four parallelisation schemes are analysed. It is concluded that. even using sophisticated techniques. high performance parallelised code cannot be generated by automatic tools unless they take into account feedback about execution-time behaviour.

A theory for the L alpha-HII phase transition and experimental tests of the theory are reviewed.

The tendency to curl is quantitatively given by the intrinsic radius of curvature. Ro. which minimizes the bending energy of a lipid monolayer. When bilayer (large Ro) and nonbilayer (small Ro) lipids are properly mixed. the resulting layer has a value of Ro that is at the critical edge of bilayer stability.

1159150,Stability of lyotropic phases with curved interfaces,1989,Sol M Gruner,93,The Journal of Physical Chemistry,22,7562-7570,American Chemical Society,The diverse structural forms of lipid-water phases are representative of those found in many lyotropic and amphiphilic systems. These structures consist of interfaces which divide the material into hydrophobic and hydrophilic volumes. The net result of a very complex set of intermolecularinteractions is that the interfaces behave as surfaces endowed with a spontaneous curvature and whose separations are subject to constraints of molecular lengths and component densities. Phase transitions which result in an abrupt change of the curvature of the interfaces may be understood phenomenologically as a competition between the elastic energy of bending the interfaces and energies resulting from the constraints of interfacial separation. The application of this approach is reviewed for transitions between lamellar. hexagonallypacked cylindrical. close-packed spherical. and bicontinuous cubic structures of diacyl …,True,mMXHvdAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,426,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100359a011,2903342738756015287,/scholar?cites=2903342738756015287,,http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/Phys446-546/Gruner_J_Phys_Chem.pdf,0,0,0

The ultimate limitations on the quality of the electron beam. which are directly reflected in many of the most important characteristics of the SR beams. arise from the physics of equilibrium processes fundamental to the operation of storage rings. It is possible to produce electron beams with superior characteristics for SR via photoinjected electron sources and high-energy linacs; however. the energy consumption of such machines is prohibitive. This limitation can be overcome by the use of an energy recovery linac (ERL). which involves configuring the electron-beam path to use the same superconducting linac as a decelerator of the electron beam after SR production. thereby recovering the beam energy for acceleration of new electrons …,True,p6bxql0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,147,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1420754,9257763354129120385,/scholar?cites=9257763354129120385,,http://www.lns.cornell.edu/~ib38/papers/02/RSI_Gruner_2002_v73_p1402.pdf,0,0,0

It is a 4-pass recirculating linac that recovers the beam's energy by 4 additional. decelerating passes. All beams are returned for deceleration in a single beam pipe with a large-momentum-aperture permanent magnet FFAG optics. Cornell University has been pioneering a new class of accelerators. Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs). with a new characteristic set of beam parameters. Technology has been prototyped that is essential for any high brightness electron ERL. This includes a DC electron source and an SRF injector Linac with world-record current and normalized brightness in a bunch train. a high-current linac cryomodule. and a high-power beam stop. and several diagnostics tools for high-current and high-brightness beams. All these are now being used to construct a novel one-cryomodule ERL in Cornell's Wilson Lab. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has designed a multi-turn ERL for eRHIC. where beam is transported more than 20 times around the 4km long RHIC tunnel. The number of transport lines is minimized by using two arcs with strongly-focusing permanent magnets that can control many beams of different energies. A collaboration between BNL and Cornell has been formed to investigate this multi-turn eRHIC ERL design by building a 4-turn. one-cryomodule ERL at Cornell. It also has a return loop built with strongly focusing permanent magnets and is meant to accelerate 40mA beam to 150MeV.

After the maximum energy of 150 MeV is reached. the electron beam is brought back to the linac with opposite Radio Frequency (RF) phase. Energy is recovered and reduced to the initial value of 6 MeV with 4 additional passes. There are many novelties: a single NS-FFAG structure. made of permanent magnets. brings electrons with four different energies back to the linac. A new adiabatic NS-FFAG arc-to-straight section merges 4 separated orbits into a single orbit in the straight section.,True,pTwZYEcAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC,14,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1435163,8282787801513250857,/scholar?cites=8282787801513250857,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1435163,0,0,0

This 5 GeV ERL is an upgrade of the CESR ring that currently powers the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) [1]. Due to its very small electron-beam emittances. it would dramatically improve the capabilities of the light source and result in X-ray beams orders of magnitude better than any existing storage-ring light source. The emittances are based upon simulations for currents that are competitive with ring-based sources [2. 4]. The ERL design that is presented has to allow for non-destructive trans port of these small emittances. The design includes a series of X-ray beamlines for specific areas of research.

It is critical to the ILCDR GDE to understand electron cloud (EC) growth and patterns. and to develop EC suppression techniques in the wiggler beampipes. The CESR-c superconducting wigglers (SCWs). closely matching the parameters of the ILCDR wigglers. serve as unique testing vehicles. As part of the CesrTA project. we replaced the copper beampipes of two SCWs with EC diagnostic beampipes. where one of the beampipes is uncoated and the second is coated with a thin TiN film. Each of the EC diagnostic beampipes is equipped with three retarding field analyzers (RFAs) at strategic longitudinal locations in the wiggler field. Each of the RFAs has 12-fold segmentation to measure the horizontal EC density distribution. To maintain sufficient vertical beam aperture and to fit within the SCW warm bore. a thin style of RFA (with a thickness of 2.5 mm) has been developed and deployed. These SCWs with RFA-equipped beampipe have been installed and successfully operated in the re-configured CesrTA vacuum system.

The completion of the human genome has allowed the identification of the expressed regions of protein-coding genes; however. little is known concerning the organization of their cis-regulatory elements. We have mapped the association of the estrogen receptor (ER) with the complete nonrepetitive sequence of human chromosomes 21 and 22 by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with tiled microarrays. ER binds selectively to a limited number of sites. the majority of which are distant from the transcription start sites of regulated genes.

1159224,How proteins enter the nucleus.,1991,Pamela A Silver,64,Cell,3,489,,Nuclear protein import is a selective process. Proteins destined for the nucleus contain NLSs. These short stretches of amino acids interact with proteins located in the cytoplasm. on the nuclear envelope. and/or at the nuclear pore complex. Following binding at the pore complex. proteins are translocated through the pore into the nucleus in a manner requiring ATP. The biochemical dissection of the nuclear pore complex has begun. Alteration of protein import into the nucleus is emerging as a new and complex form of regulation. However. we are left with the following problems: How do proteins move through the cytoplasm to reach the nuclear pore? How does the nuclear pore complex open and close in a selective manner? How is ATP utilized during import?

We therefore examined the association of components of the nuclear transport machinery including karyopherins. nucleoporins. and the Ran guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF) with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We find that most nucleoporins and karyopherins preferentially associate with a subset of highly transcribed genes and with genes that possess Rap1 binding sites whereas the RanGEF preferentially associates with transcriptionally inactive genes. Consistent with coupling of transcription to the nuclear pore. we show that transcriptional activation of the GAL genes results in their association with nuclear pore proteins. relocation to the nuclear periphery. and loss of RanGEF association.

Methylation at arginines. although discovered over 30 years ago. has only recently come to the attention of cell biologists through a combination of genetic and molecular biology experiments that have implicated arginine methylation in processes from signaling and transcription activation to protein sorting.

We show here that mutation of the FOB1 gene slows the generation of these circles and thus extends life span. Fob1p is known to create a unidirectional block to replication forks in the rDNA. We show that Fob1p is a nucleolar protein. suggesting a direct involvement in the replication fork block. We propose that this block can trigger aging by causing chromosomal breaks. the repair of which results in the generation of rDNA circles.

Downstream targets of this pathway include the Forkhead family of transcription factors (FOXO1a. FOXO3a. FOXO4). In PTEN null cells. FOXO1a is inactivated by PI3K-dependent phosphorylation and mislocalization to the cytoplasm. yet still undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.

Many of these hnRNPs are methylated on arginine residues. In the yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the predominant enzyme responsible for arginine methylation is Hmt1p. Hmt1p methylates both Npl3p and Hrp1p. which are shuttling hnRNPs involved in mRNA processing and export. Here. we employ an in vivo nuclear export assay to show that arginine methylation is important for the nuclear export of these hnRNPs. Both Npl3p and Hrp1p fail to exit the nucleus in cells lacking Hmt1p. and overexpression of Hmt1p enhances Npl3p export. The export of a novel hnRNP-like protein.

NPL3 encodes an RNA-binding protein that shuttles in and out of the nucleus. Export of poly(A)+ RNA has been shown previously to be blocked in np13-1 mutants. To understand the role of Np13p in RNA export. we have developed a novel assay that effectively uncouples nuclear protein export from reimport. With this assay. we show that Np13p satisfies several of the predicted requirements for a protein carrier for mRNA export. Temperature-sensitive mutations in the RNA recognition motifs of Np13p result in nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA. One such mutation prevents nuclear export of Np13p. Moreover. Np13p export depends on ongoing RNA polymerase II transcription.

Engineering approaches must redirect the transfer of chemical reducing equivalents. preventing these electrons from being lost to general cellular metabolism. This is especially the case for high energy electrons stored in iron-sulfur clusters within proteins. which are readily transferred when two such clusters are brought in close proximity. Iron sulfur proteins therefore require mechanisms to ensure interaction between proper partners. analogous to many signal transduction proteins.

In this quest. a successful finding is the partial substitution of diesel with ethanol/bioethanol rather than completely replacing it. These blends of diesel and ethanol/bioethanol can be used in the existing CI engines without any major modifications and the most significant result of using this blend is the lower emission with almost the same performance as of diesel fuel alone. Two major drawbacks of using this blend are low miscibility of ethanol/bioethanol in diesel and low temperature instability of produced blend. However. biodiesel can be successfully added to prevent the phase separation of diesel–ethanol/bioethanol blend.

However. there are concerns over the compatibility of currently used automotive materials in biodiesel. A few automobile manufacturers extended their warranty only to lower blends of biodiesel (e.g. B5). Higher blends (e.g. B50 or B100) are still not covered by warranty. In automobile fuel system. metallic materials like ferrous alloy and non-ferrous alloys. and elastomers come in contact with fuel. Biodiesel. having different chemical characteristics from diesel. can interact with materials in a different way. It can cause corrosive and tribological attack on metallic components and degrade elastomer parts.

In this quest. a successful finding is the partial substitution of diesel with ethanol/bioethanol rather than completely replacing it. These blends of diesel and ethanol/bioethanol can be used in the existing CI engines without any major modifications and the most significant result of using this blend is the lower emission with almost the same performance as of diesel fuel alone. Two major drawbacks of using this blend are low miscibility of ethanol/bioethanol in diesel and low temperature instability of produced blend. However. biodiesel can be successfully added to prevent the phase separation of diesel–ethanol/bioethanol blend.

During idling. petrol vehicles emit a minimum amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and negligible particulate matter (PM). However. generally a large amount of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons (HC) are produced from vehicles. Petrol vehicles consume far more fuel at an hourly rate than their diesel counterparts during idling. Higher NOx and comparatively larger PM are produced by diesel vehicles than petrol vehicles on average during idling. 1Previous attempts to address vehicle idling through public education have had some success. For example. a campaign targeting idling in school parking lots in one Canadian suburb resulted in a 34% decline in the number of vehicles observed idling while waiting. and a decrease in the average amount of time spent idling from 3.7 to 2.5 minutes. 2 The long term …,True,LPVTA9cAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://blogs.napier.ac.uk/tri/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2020/02/Essential-Evidence-4-Scotland-No-23-Anti-idling-near-schools.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

One of the green energy sources discovered recently is biodiesel. Biodiesel is a source of clean alternative fuel for internal combustion engines. which reduces the exhaust emissions significantly. Like diesel. biodiesel also emits exhaust particulate matter (PM). which is responsible for the black soot coming out from the diesel engine. However. it is not clear that what will be the size of PM formed during the idle speed of a biodiesel fueled engine. In this study. the characteristics of the exhaust particulate during the idling speed of a biodiesel fueled single cylinder diesel engine is analyzed. Biodiesel showed a positive result in terms of the concentration of emitted PM. However. particle sizes were smaller in case of biodiesel than diesel. Further studies should be carried out to improve the properties of biodiesel to ensure that the emitted particle sizes are not toxic to human health.,True,LPVTA9cAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,http://www.jocet.org/vol5/334-ES012.pdf,,,,http://www.jocet.org/vol5/334-ES012.pdf,0,0,0

It is conventionally assumed that nitrogen‐centered aminyl radicals react slowly with oxygen in the troposphere and  associate predominantly with the radicals •NO and NO2• to form toxic nitrosamines and nitramines. We have used theoretical kinetic modeling techniques to study the prototypical CH3N•H + O2 reaction and have shown that it proceeds to CH2NH + HO2• under tropospheric conditions with a rate coefficient of 3.6 × 10−17 cm3 molecule−1 s−1. Although this value is low compared to the competing NOx reactions (∼10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1). the much higher concentration of O2 versus NOx in air makes it the dominant process in the atmospheric oxidation of methylamine for NOx concentrations below 100 ppb.

Nowadays. it is important issue to protect the environment and replace the mineral oil due to the increase of the oil prices and reduction of the oil reserves. It is essential to find out an alternative oil for the replacement of mineral oil based lubricants and vegetable oil already meets the requirements. Vegetable oils based biolubricants are non-toxic. biodegradable. renewable and have a good lubricating performance than mineral oil based lubricant. This study evaluated the lubricating properties and tribological characteristics of Moringa oleifera oil and compared with coconut. rice brain and lube oil. The friction and wear characteristics of the oil investigated by using a four ball tester according to ASTM 4172 method. MOO showed higher viscosity and viscosity index compared to other vegetable oils and it is better for boundary lubrication. In thermogravimetric analysis. it was found that MOO remains thermally stable up to 300 C. MOO showed a lower amount of coefficient of friction and wear scar diameter compared to other vegetables oils and lube oil. Therefore.

Jatropha. and cottonseed sources. animal fats. and waste cooking oil. Biodiesel is considered as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. However. biodiesel has poor cold flow behavior (i.e.. high cloud point & pour point) and oxidation stability compared with petroleum diesel because of the presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid esters. Consequently. the performance of biodiesel during cold weather is affected. When biodiesel is oxidized. the subsequent dregs can adversely affect the performance of the fuel system as well as clog the fuel filter. fuel lines. and injector.

The complete products of combustion are H2O and CO2 and they have no odor. Therefore. other products of incomplete combustion like unburned fuel components. partially burned components. cracked products from thermal cracking and others are thought to be responsible for exhaust odor. As the THC in the exhaust is the result of incomplete combustion. it is a logical guess that THC in the exhaust would correlate with exhaust odor. This study measured THC in the exhaust. and a good correlation was found between THC and exhaust odor at different engine conditions. In the next step. GC-analysis was used to detect individual HC component. and its effect on odor formation was investigated. It is found that the low boiling point hydrocarbon components. especially CH4 in diesel exhaust has a good correlation with exhaust odor. Aldehyde is one partially burned component which has very strong odor.

In Malaysia. the gasoline fuel price per litre for RON 97 and RON 100 are higher than RON 95 at all times. In general. the influence of different research octane number (RON) fuels on engine performance remains unknown to the public. This research aimed to experimentally study the effect of RON of the commercially available gasoline fuels on the performance. emission and combustion characteristic of a spark ignition (SI) engine. Gasoline fuels with RON 97 and RON 100 were tested and benchmarked with RON 95 as baseline on a singlecylinder. air cooled. four-stroke spark-ignition gasoline engine. The engine speed was varied from 1600 to 3200 rpm with 400 rpm increment under full throttle conditions. Generally. the results indicated that higher octane fuel reduced the emission of CO and HC. while lower octane fuels caused a lower emission of CO2 and NOx. Besides. a higher cylinder pressure and heat release rate were achieved with lower octane fuel of RON95.

In the present work. a new light biofuel—Melaleuca Cajuputi oil (MCO)—was introduced to blend with refined palm oil (RPO). The physicochemical properties. combustion characteristics. engine performance. and exhaust emissions were comprehensively examined. It was found that the higher the percentage of MCO. the lower the viscosity and density of the blends obtained. Calorific value (CV) was increased with the increase of MCO fraction in the blend. Regression analysis has suggested that the blend of 32%(v/v) of RPO and 68%(v/v) of MCO (RPO32MCO68) is optimal to obtain viscosity and density in accordance with ASTM 6751/EN 14214 standards. The experimental results show that the in-cylinder pressure. brake torque. and brake power of the optimal blend were slightly lower than those of baseline diesel fuel. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). carbon monoxide (CO). and unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) were found to be slightly higher compared to diesel fuel. Notably. nitrogen oxides (NO x) and smoke opacity were found to be decreased over the entire range of the test. Overall. the optimal blend of RPO32MCO68 has shown a decent result which marks it as a potential viable source of biofuel.

Performance and emissions results were recorded under steady state operating conditions. The engine was converted to computer integrated CNG-gasoline bi-fuel operations by installing a sequential port injection CNG conversion system. An engine control system and portable exhaust gas analyzer were used for controlling engine operations and recording engine performance and emissions data. The engine was run at wide open throttle and constant speed ranging from 1500 to 5000 rpm with 500 rpm increment. On average.

It is a very promising alternative fuel due to many reasons including adaptability to those engines. low in cost. and low emission levels. Unfortunately. when converting to CNG. engines usually suffer from reduced power and limited engine speed. These are due to volumetric loss and slower flame speed. Direct injection (DI) can mitigate these problems by injecting CNG after the intake valve closes. thus increasing volumetric efficiency. In addition. the high pressure gas jet can enhance the turbulence in the cylinder which is beneficial to the mixing and burning.

Undoubtedly rice coo er is an example of all these. It is a combination of coc ing and warming mode by which rice is coo ed and ept warm. The purpose of this paper is to model an electric rice coo er with improved warming mode. Generally bacteria can grow upto55 temperature and the condensation of moisture occurs below 65 temperature which causes rice spoiling. So it can easily be prevented by eeping coo ed rice above 65 temperature. By following this principle two warming coil of nicrom wire are added. where one is at upper parts and another is at side wall around the fiber paper. By this process a locally available rice coo er is designed which is capable of eeping rice fresh and warm for 5-7 days and saves energy from12 to 15 units per month.,True,1Qi64fYAAAAJ:Mojj43d5GZwC,2,https://www.academia.edu/download/51190635/MODELING_AND_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_ELE20170104-26252-14qfwzm.pdf,15122015756701277492,/scholar?cites=15122015756701277492,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51190635/MODELING_AND_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_ELE20170104-26252-14qfwzm.pdf,0,0,0

1159691,Design and implementation of energy generated magneto-rheological damper for vehicle suspension systems,2015,Raju Ahamed,,,,,,Magneto rheological (MR) fluid based dampers are very promising for semi-active or adaptive suspension control system which is filled with MR fluid. Its huge advantages attract the researchers to use it in more advanced application. MR damper s damping force can be controlled by changing the viscosity of its internal magneto-rheological fluids (MRF). However the requirement of external power source is one of the major concerns. Self-powered MR damper is one of the recent advancement which is accomplished only for double ended MR damper. In this work an energy generated mono tube MR damper has been designed and investigated with power generation which has a huge demand in the vehicle suspension system. This damper combines the advantages of energy harvesting (reusing wasted energy) and MR damping (controllable damping force). This multifunctional integration would bring great benefits such as energy saving. size and weight reduction. lower cost. high reliability. and less maintenance for the MR damper systems. The proposed MR damper model consists permanent magnet and coil combination of energy generation. Two magnetic fields are induced inside this damper. One is in the outer coil of the power generator and another is the piston head coils. A 2-D Axisymmetric model of energy generated MR damper is developed in COMSOL Multiphysics where it is analyzed extensively by finite element method and its hardware model is tested by Universal Testing Machine (UTM).

In this quest. a successful finding is the partial substitution of diesel with ethanol/bioethanol rather than completely replacing it. These blends of diesel and ethanol/bioethanol can be used in the existing CI engines without any major modifications and the most significant result of using this blend is the lower emission with almost the same performance as of diesel fuel alone. Two major drawbacks of using this blend are low miscibility of ethanol/bioethanol in diesel and low temperature instability of produced blend. However. biodiesel can be successfully added to prevent the phase separation of diesel–ethanol/bioethanol blend. Thus. this blend becomes stable even at lower temperatures and more amount of ethanol/bioethanol can be added to them.

These controllers can have either a conventional fixed structure composed by stages of gain and phase compensation or a flexible modern structure composed by three bands that correspond to a specific frequency range (low. intermediate and high frequency) in which each band is composed by two branches that are based on differential filters (with a gain. lead-lag blocks and a hybrid block).

The contamination of river waterfrom kaolin processing activities may be harmful to people inthe way of slow but chronic poisoning. On the other hand. the discharge of untreated or inadequately treated domestic sewage into aquatic environments can also cause deleterious effects to the health. However. no reliable figures are available for pollutant occurrences in river water. This draws attention to thevery precarious situation that exists with respect to pollutionby organic and inorganic toxic wastes. especially with respect to humans and fauna in all its expressions.

For each of the 166 participants several clinical features were observed or measured. including age. BMI. Glucose. Insulin. HOMA. Leptin. Adiponectin. Resistin and MCP-1. Machine learning algorithms (logistic regression. random forests. support vector machines) were implemented taking in as predictors different numbers of variables. The resulting models were assessed with a Monte Carlo Cross-Validation approach to determine 95% confidence intervals for the sensitivity. specificity and AUC of the models. Support vector machines models using Glucose. Resistin.

Estas são resultado do desbalanço entre os torques elétrico e mecânico nas máquinas síncronas após pequenas variações de carga e de geração. Caso não sejam amortecidas. estas podem deteriorar os geradores. reduzir os limites de transferência de potência entre áreas e causar blecautes. Desde a década de setenta. estabilizadores de sistemas de potência (power system stabilizers–PSS) têm sido usados para o amortecimento de oscilações através do controle da excitação dos geradores. Com o advento dos dispositivos FACTS. surgiram novas oportunidades para um controle mais eficaz em regime permanente dos sistemas bem como para o amortecimento de oscilações (através dos controladores power oscillation damper–POD).

É um problema bem estabelecido na literatura. sendo resolvido por métodos de otimização não lineares. Por outro lado. uma solução fornecida pelo FPO pode ser viável em regime permanente e inviável no regime dinâmico (avaliado em estudos de estabilidade do rotor dos geradores).

A recent issue that has arisen concerning this problem is to define a convergence criterion when using conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) with SDDP due to the lack of good upper bound estimators. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a convergence criterion in which including CVaR does not hinder convergence analysis. Also. the proposed method does not increase the computational burden. Moreover. this paper provides a method that allows forward paths to be individually assessed. which can then either be discarded to reduce computational time or even replaced in an alternative resampling scheme in the SDDP.

The SC placement and size are determined using an optimal power flow (OPF) program via the Benders cut technique to include the contingency influence. This problem is solved in two steps: (i) The SC size and placement are determined as an investment OPF subproblem. The SC cost and energy production cost are included in the objective function; (ii) The operation OPF subproblem is solved considering the specified line and generation outages. The Benders cut are generated according to the outage occurrence probability. In this case the objective function is the minimum load shedding and energy production cost. The OPF subproblems are solved using linear programming technique.

1159931,Impact of decision-making models in Transmission Expansion Planning considering large shares of renewable energy sources,2019,Phillipe Vilaca Gomes and Joao T Saraiva and Leonel Carvalho and Bruno Dias and Leonardo W Oliveira,174,Electric Power Systems Research,,105852,Elsevier,Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) is traditionally carried out based on long-term forecasts for the peak load. which is viewed as the worst-case scenario. However. with the increasing renewable penetration. the peak load may not be longer the only worst-case to quantify new investment requirements. In fact. high off-peak load scenarios combined with low renewable generation can originate unforeseen bottlenecks. Besides. as TEP is a time-consuming problem. relaxed decision-making processes are often proposed in the literature to address the problem. however there is no guarantee that optimal planning has been achieved when some costs in the decision-making process are neglected. In this sense. this paper proposes a novel methodological framework to ensure that the system is sufficiently robust to overcome conditions with high electricity demand and low renewable energy. furthermore. this paper …,True,igH9iogAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,9,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779619301658,11511544106216095499,/scholar?cites=11511544106216095499,,https://www.academia.edu/download/62015804/RES_TEP20200206-56012-1edi15h.pdf,0,0,0

1159943,Parallel computation of large power system networks using the multi-area Thévenin equivalents,2009,Marcelo Aroca Tomim,,,,,,Description The requirements of today's power systems are much different from the ones of the systems of the past. Among others. energy market deregulation. proliferation of independent power producers. unusual power transfers. increased complexity and sensitivity of the equipments demand from power systems operators and planners a thorough understanding of the dynamic behaviour of such systems in order to ensure a stable and reliable energy supply. In this context. on-line Dynamic Security Assessment (DSA) plays a fundamental role in helping operators to predict the security level of future operating conditions that the system may undergo. Amongst the tools that compound DSA is the Transient Stability Assessment (TSA) tools. which aim at determining the dynamic stability margins of present and future operating conditions. The systems employed in on-line TSA. however. are very much simplified versions of the actual systems. due to the time-consuming transient stability simulations that are still at the heart of TSA applications. Therefore. there is an increasing need for improved TSA software. which has the capability of simulating bigger and more complex systems in a shorter lapse of time. In order to achieve such a goal. a reformulation of the Multi-Area Thévenin Equivalents (MATE) algorithm is proposed. The intent of such an algorithm is parallelizing the solution of the large sparse linear systems associated with transient stability simulations and. therefore. speeding up the overall on-line TSA cycle.

This configuration presents the advantage of not requiring an offshore substation with a power transformer to increase the power plant terminal voltage since the generators are connected in series through the DC terminals of the interface rectifiers.

The modular multilevel inverter regulates the current through the DC link cable instead of the voltage of the DC system.

However. with the increasing renewable penetration. the peak load may not be longer the only worst-case to quantify new investment requirements. In fact. high off-peak load scenarios combined with low renewable generation can originate unforeseen bottlenecks. Besides. as TEP is a time-consuming problem. relaxed decision-making processes are often proposed in the literature to address the problem. however there is no guarantee that optimal planning has been achieved when some costs in the decision-making process are neglected.

Electrical Energy generation companies increase their attention to maintenance costs. specially related with labour costs. A part of maintenance activities demands in industries are related to maintenance of electrical panels. It is important to reduce the execution time of those activities while maintaining the quality of the service.

A recent issue that has arisen concerning this problem is to define a convergence criterion when using conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) with SDDP due to the lack of good upper bound estimators. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a convergence criterion in which including CVaR does not hinder convergence analysis. Also. the proposed method does not increase the computational burden. Moreover. this paper provides a method that allows forward paths to be individually assessed. which can then either be discarded to reduce computational time or even replaced in an alternative resampling scheme in the SDDP.

To do this. the discrete variables of transmission system are mitigated with the use of a linear function. which is valid for the [0.1] interval. These discrete variables are considered in the optimal power flow (OPF) using interior point technique. Considering that the solution region is non convex. there could be many combinations of expansion transmission paths to match the demand. Therefore. the proposed algorithm is started taking into account different starting points. Presently. it is possible to find a reduced set of likely transmission expansion paths.

1160002,Robust decentralised control design using genetic algorithms in power system damping control,1998,GN Taranto and DM Falcao,145,"IEE Proceedings-Generation, Transmission and Distribution",1,1-6,IET Digital Library,The paper presents the design of linear robust decentralised fixed-structure power system damping controllers using genetic algorithms (GA). The designed controllers follow a classical structure consisting of a gain. a wash-out stage and two lead-lag stages. To each controller is associated a set of three parameters representing the controller gain and the controller phase characteristics. The GA searches for an optimum solution over the parameter space. Controller robustness is taken into account as the design procedure considers a prespecified set of operating conditions to be either stabilised or improved in the sense of damping ratio enhancement. A truly decentralised control design is achieved as the loop control channels are closed simultaneously. The approach is used to design SVC and TCSC damping controllers to enhance the damping of the interarea modes in a three-area six-machine system.

Ltd.,A team algorithm based on piecewise quadratic simultaneous Lyapunov functions for robust stability analysis and control design of uncertain time‐varying linear systems is introduced. The objective is to use robust stability criteria that are less conservative than the usual quadratic stability criterion. The use of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions leads to a non‐convex optimization problem. which is decomposed into a convex subproblem in a selected subset of decision variables. and a lower‐dimensional non‐convex subproblem in the remaining decision variables. A team algorithm that combines genetic algorithms (GA) for the non‐convex subproblem and interior‐point methods for the solution of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). which form the convex subproblem. is proposed.

Both have their wellknown advantages and drawbacks. Contingency enumeration is conceptually simple and usually requires low computational effort. Conversely. Monte Carlo simulation is computationally harder. but much more versatile to model random aspects. This paper depicts some major aspects regarding both methods.

On the other hand. most of the optimal power flows (OPF) utilised in available reliability programs adopt an optimised logic for voltage control. i.e. the voltage level is optimised inside the pre-specified bounds. meaning that new settings can be calculated in order to avoid or minimise load shedding. However. in several practical situations this is not a feasible approach. due to operational constraints.

The capability of detecting and identifying bad data depends on the redundancy level of the information to be processed. Network changes or a temporary malfunction of the data acquisition system reduce data redundancy for state estimation.

As voltage collapses may be caused by insufficiency of reactive power support. and considering that reactive power can be locally supplied. for instance. by shunt capacitors. this paper addresses the impacts of local control actions on the system loadability. The study is carried out in two steps. First. by using the tangent vector technique. two important areas of the power system are identified: the critical area under the point of view of voltage collapse. and the area most sensitive to active power losses reduction. Second. once these two areas are identified. an optimization technique takes place to optimize the amount of shunt reactive power compensation that should be available in each bus.

1160130,Allocation of transmission loss cost using game theory,2007,Yuri P Molina and Ricardo B Prada and Osvaldo R Saavedra,,,,407-412,IEEE,This paper presents a novel procedure for the allocation of active and reactive power losses among generators and loads in the transmission grid. The procedure considers the grid as a block. making it unnecessary to analyze the elements within that block. The method allocates the active and reactive power losses jointly by using the circuit theory combined with the game theory (Aumann-Shapley). Arbitrarily. half the losses are allocated to the loads and half to the generators. The method was tested on a 5-bus sample system and on the IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that the method provides a consistent assignment of responsibilities. reflecting the generator and load locations in the grid and in agreement with the circuit laws.,True,c9EPp-EAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,18,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4538352/,14727723173680173719,/scholar?cites=14727723173680173719,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Osvaldo_Saavedra3/publication/4341575_Allocation_of_transmission_loss_cost_using_game_theory/links/0c96052cfdc5482c10000000/Allocation-of-transmission-loss-cost-using-game-theory.pdf,0,0,0

1160134,Voltage stability: phenomena characterization based on reactive control effects and system critical areas identification,1992,Ricardo B Prada and AC Zambroni and Xisto Vieira Filho and AG Massaud and J CC Oliveira,,,,,,This paper presents a characterization of the voltage stability problem based on the effects of voltage control action and thus. on the existence of a maximum amount of active/reactive power that can be transmitted to a load bus. Three different situations leading to voltage collapse are described. The usual problem of excessive voltage drop due to reactive sources depletion is only one of them. and it is made clear that this problem is fundamentally different from the two others. The possibilities of voltage collapse occurrence are associated with two operating regions and the boundary between them. An analytical tool for voltage stability assessment is derived. It is capable of identifying in which region each area of the system is operating in and the distance from the boundary. It is flexible enough to incorporate different system models. The developed method was able to detect real voltage stability problems in one area of the South-Southeast Brazilian system. which substantiates the applicability and adequacy of the analytical tool. 12 refs.. 4 figs.. 3 tabs.,True,c9EPp-EAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,16,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/537084,7814778574280118678,/scholar?cites=7814778574280118678,,,0,0,0

1160150,Comparison between three implementations of automatic identification algorithms for the quantification and characterization of mesoscale eddies in the South Atlantic Ocean,2011,JMAC Souza and C de Boyer Montégut and Pierre-Yves Le Traon,7,Ocean Science,3,317-334,Copernicus GmbH, Three methods for automatic detection of mesoscale coherent structures are applied to Sea Level Anomaly (SLA) fields in the South Atlantic. The first method is based on the wavelet packet decomposition of the SLA data. the second on the estimation of the Okubo-Weiss parameter and the third on a geometric criterion using the winding-angle approach. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the mesoscale eddies over the South Atlantic Ocean. emphasizing their main characteristics: amplitude. diameter. duration and propagation velocity. Five areas of particular eddy dynamics were selected: the Brazil Current. the Agulhas eddies propagation corridor. the Agulhas Current retroflexion. the Brazil-Malvinas confluence zone and the northern branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). For these areas. mean propagation velocities and amplitudes were calculated. Two regions with long duration eddies were observed. corresponding to the propagation of Agulhas and ACC eddies. Through the comparison between the identification methods. their main advantages and shortcomings were detailed. The geometric criterion presents the best performance. mainly in terms of number of detections. duration of the eddies and propagation velocities. The results are particularly good for the Agulhas Rings. which have the longest lifetimes of all South Atlantic eddies.,True,qYDmVFQAAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC,124,https://os.copernicus.org/articles/7/317/2011/,12681606620688978888,/scholar?cites=12681606620688978888,,https://os.copernicus.org/articles/7/317/2011/os-7-317-2011.pdf,0,0,0

Advances in metering system infrastructure and the deployment of a large number of smart meters in the grid will produce a big volume of data that will be required for many different applications. Despite the significant investments taking place in the communications infrastructure. this remains a bottleneck for the implementation of some applications. This paper presents a methodology for lossy data compression in smart distribution systems using the singular value decomposition technique. The proposed method is capable of significantly reducing the volume of data to be transmitted through the communications network and accurately reconstructing the original data.

Sudan and Egypt). An insight into soil erosion/sedimentation mechanisms and mitigation methods plays an imperative role for the sustainable water resources development in the region. This paper presents daily sediment yield simulations in the Upper Blue Nile under different Best Management Practice (BMP) scenarios. Scenarios applied in this paper are (i) maintaining existing conditions. (ii) introducing filter strips. (iii) applying stone bunds (parallel terraces). and (iv) reforestation. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to model soil erosion. identify soil erosion prone areas and assess the impact of BMPs on sediment reduction. For the existing conditions scenario. the model results showed a satisfactory agreement between daily observed and simulated sediment concentrations as indicated by Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency greater than 0.83. The simulation results showed that applying filter strips. stone bunds and reforestation scenarios reduced the current sediment yields both at the subbasins and the basin outlets.

Although several developed countries have well-established systems for river monitoring and flood early warning. figures of populations affected every year by floods in developing countries are unsettling. This paper presents the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). which has been set up to provide an overview on upcoming floods in large world river basins. GloFAS is based on distributed hydrological simulation of numerical ensemble weather predictions with global coverage. Streamflow forecasts are compared statistically to climatological simulations to detect probabilistic exceedance of warning thresholds. In this article. the system setup is described. together with an evaluation of its performance over a two-year test period and a qualitative analysis of a case study for the Pakistan flood. in summer 2010. It is shown that hazardous events in large river basins can be skilfully detected with a forecast horizon of up to 1 month.

These uncertainties lead to errors that are revealed when model outputs are compared to observations. Such uncertainty is typically described by calculating the residuals. However. residuals should not be seen as an estimate of total uncertainty. since through the calibration process. the residuals may be reduced by over-adjustment to the data. which is typically the case for over-parameterised models.

Yet to date. a generic conceptual framework for building models of catchment systems that include adequate representation of socioeconomic systems – and the dynamic feedbacks between human and natural systems – has remained elusive. In an attempt to work towards such a model. this paper outlines a generic framework for models of socio-hydrology applicable to agricultural catchments. made up of six key components that combine to form the coupled system dynamics: namely. catchment hydrology. population. economics. environment. socioeconomic sensitivity and collective response. The conceptual framework posits two novel constructs: (i) a composite socioeconomic driving variable. termed the Community Sensitivity state variable. which seeks to capture the perceived level of threat to a community's quality of life. and acts as a key link tying together one of the fundamental feedback loops of the coupled system. and (ii) a Behavioural Response variable as the observable feedback mechanism. which reflects land and water management decisions relevant to the hydrological context. The framework makes a further contribution through the introduction of three macro-scale parameters that enable it to normalise for differences in climate. socioeconomic and political gradients across study sites.

Up to date. more than 20 peer-reviewed papers describe the use of SWAT for a variety of problems in the upper Nile basin countries. such as erosion modelling. land use and climate change impact modelling and water resources management. The majority of the studies are focused on locations in the tropical highlands in Ethiopia and around Lake Victoria. The popularity of SWAT is attributed to the fact that the tool is freely available and that it is readily applicable through the development of geographic information system (GIS) based interfaces and its easy linkage to sensitivity. calibration and uncertainty analysis tools. The online and free availability of basic GIS data that are required for SWAT made its applicability more straightforward even in data-scarce areas. However. the easy use of SWAT may not always lead to appropriate models which is also a consequence of the quality of the available free databases in these regions.

Monte Carlo samples are in general robust. but may require a high number of simulations and consequently a large amount of computational resources (time and disk memory). The concept of the Latin-Hypercube Simulation (McKay et al.. 1979; McKay. 1988) is based on the Monte Carlo Simulation but uses a stratified sampling approach that allows efficient estimation of the output statistics. It subdivides the distribution of each parameter into N ranges. each with a probability of occurrence equal to 1/N. Random values of the parameters are generated such that each range is sampled only once. The model is then run N times with the random combinations of the parameters. The model results are typically analysed with multi-variate linear regression or correlation statistics methods. The Latin-Hypercube sampling is commonly applied in water quality modelling due to its efficiency and robustness (Weijers and Vanrolleghem. 1997; Vandenberghe et al.. 2001).

Relative changes in simulated mean annual runoff (MAR) and four indicators of high and low extreme flows are compared between the two ensembles. The ensemble median values of changes in runoff with three different scenarios of global-mean warming (1. 2 and 3 °C above pre-industrial levels) are generally similar between the two ensembles. although the ensemble spread is often larger for the Glob-HM ensemble.

Pesticides can enter river systems both immediately after application. i.e. as a direct loss. or with some time delay due to runoff or leaching. We define a direct loss as the sum of point losses and drift losses on an application day that will reach the river immediately after or during application. Point losses are due to the clean-up of spray equipment. leaking tools. waste water treatment plants etc. Different studies demonstrated the importance of direct losses. In small river systems. their contribution accounts for 30 to 90% of the pesticide load to surface water.As many studies and models only partly take into account these direct losses or even not at all. we attempted to model the dynamic occurrence of pesticides also coming from these …,True,BP_MPIIAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,79,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815207000904,8358468093766647671,/scholar?cites=8358468093766647671,,https://modeleau.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/modeleau/documents/Publications/pvr750.pdf,0,0,0

This thinking is stimulated by the Dublin principle that water should be considered an economic good. But is this reasoning correct? Is economic pricing an adequate means to reach more desirable levels of demand? There is considerable misunderstanding about what the concept of water as an economic good implies. In this paper it is argued that water pricing should primarily serve the purpose of financial sustainability through cost recovery. Moreover. in water pricing. adequate attention should be given to equity considerations through. for example. increasing block tariffs. Instead of economic pricing there is a need for defining a reasonable price. which provides full cost recovery but which safeguards ecological requirements and access to safe water for the poor.

Southern Africa has a distinct dry and wet season. and. more importantly. its climate is characterised by a high variation between relatively wet and dry years. a phenomenon much less pronounced in the EU. In addition overall evaporative capacity in the SADC region is considerably higher than in EU countries. In general. the SADC region is a water scarce area in comparison with Europe. For SADC countries water is key to sustainable development (IHE. 1994). Table 1 shows that many SADC countries are rapidly approaching situations of water stress (generally defined as less than 1700 m3 per capita per year). if not absolute water scarcity (less than 1000 m3 per capita per year)(Engelman & LeRoy. 1993; Gleick. 1993). A striking difference between EU and SADC countries is that the per capita water availability in the SADC region. which is already low. is expected to reduce by half by the year 2025. whereas per capita water availability in Europe remains virtually constant. The rapid decline in SADC countries is mainly a result of population growth. Data on per capita water availability suffer from lack of relevant hydrological information. Traditionally. the computations are based on the availability of surface water. The data of Gardner-Outlaw and Engelman (1997). in Table 1. also suffer from that bias.

Moreover. farmers would be more encouraged to implement soil conservation measures when they have larger areas of cropland. We explore the possibility that when farmers presume that they have fertile land. they exploit their land more.

We show how the rapidly changing world urges us to continuously improve our understanding of the complex interactions between humans and the water system.

Knowledge of hydrology and water resources engineering and management helped to transform the landscape. and thus also the very hydrology within catchments itself.

1160209,Towards measurable criteria for the equitable sharing of international water resources,2002,Pieter Van der Zaag and Imran M Seyam and Hubert HG Savenije,4,Water Policy,1,19-32,No longer published by Elsevier,Equity is key to the allocation of international water resources. Six possible criteria and allocation algorithms that operationalise the equity concept. are developed and applied to the Orange. Nile and Incomati rivers. The criterion that considers all (blue and green) water resources and that uses the basin population as the main allocation variable yields the most equitable water allocation. Two important variables are identified over which the riparian countries should reach consensus:1.The value of green water relative to blue water.2.The fraction of reserved water. which is defined as the basic entitlement of each riparian country. These findings are based on approximate data and have therefore a limited validity. With this caveat it is suggested that the approach developed in this article may help de-politicise negotiations between riparian countries and provide fresh perspectives that may unlock stalemates during …The value of green water relative to blue water.The fraction of reserved water. which is defined as the basic entitlement of each riparian country.,True,jdnfeq8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,97,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136670170200003X,644469885342431497,/scholar?cites=644469885342431497,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.458.5989&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Zimbabwe,2002,Bekithemba Gumbo and Pieter Van der Zaag,27,"Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C",11-22,805-813,Pergamon,The question posed in this paper is: why is the concept of water demand management rarely implemented on the ground? To answer this question the paper presents data on the water supply situation in the City of Mutare. Zimbabwe. It describes Mutare's water infrastructure. the patterns of water use during the period 1980–2000; and our attempts to identify and quantify water losses in the system. Suggestions are made how these losses can be reduced. which would involve relatively modest resources. The question is then asked why these measures have not yet been taken. The paper contrasts this to the Pungwe scheme. a new water supply project of huge proportions which was conceived and implemented fairly quickly. The fact that water is a vital yet finite and fugitive resource explains why powerful water coalitions may emerge between engineers. financiers and politicians.

Rules limit the manner in which water users may utilise the water resources occurring within their constituencies or territories. However an asymmetrical situation exists whereby downstream users may not affect upstream users but upstream users do cause downstream impacts. Because of this asymmetry the equitable sharing of water resources between upstream and downstream users will always imply that upstream users have to forego some potential water benefits. The general question that this paper addresses is: which institutional arrangements can be devised to (re-)establish an equilibrium between up- and downstream entities within a catchment area or river basin?

Discharges were computed using the water balance of the reservoirs. Rainfall and evaporation data were obtained from public domain data sources. In situ measurements of inflow and outflow (for validation) were obtained. as well. The other water balance components. such as the water level and surface area. for derivation of the change of storage volume were derived from satellite measurements. Water levels were obtained from Hydroweb for Roseires Reservoir and Hydroweb and Global Reservoir and Lake Monitor (GRLM) for Lake Nasser. Water surface areas were derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ images using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The water volume variations were estimated by integrating the area-level relationship of each reservoir. For Roseires Reservoir. the water levels from Hydroweb agreed well with in situ water levels (RMSE= 0.92 m; R 2= 0.96).

Working Paper 166. Colombo. Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI),The Volta Basin is a transboundary basin shared by six riparian countries. In 2007. the Volta Basin Authority (VBA) was established and it was mandated to provide legal and institutional arrangements among the riparian countries for managing the water resources of the Volta Basin. The transboundary diagnostic analysis commissioned by the VBA has highlighted five key challenges that the basin faces: changes in water quantity and seasonal flows; degradation of ecosystems; water quality concerns; governance; and climate change. A key mandate of the VBA is authorizing the development of infrastructure and projects that could have a substantial impact on the water resources in the basin.The water resources in the Volta Basin contribute significantly to the economic development of the six riparian countries. This is the case particularly for Burkina Faso and Ghana where more than 60% of the area of each country is located within the Volta Basin. The water resources are being utilized for agricultural production. domestic water use. livestock watering and hydropower production. Increasing demands on the resources have created competition between sectors and countries. Widespread construction of hydraulic infrastructure of different sizes and for different purposes has been developed over the years. Climate change and variability. and upstream water resources development have impacted the hydropower generation of Akosombo and Kpong dams. located close to the Volta Estuary.

Tanzania,2009,ML Mul and HHG Savenije and S Uhlenbrook,13,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,9,1659-1670,Copernicus GmbH, This paper describes an extreme flood event that occurred in the South Pare Mountains in northern Tanzania. A high spatial and temporal resolution data set has been gathered in a previously ungauged catchment. This data was analysed using a multi-method approach. to gather information about the processes that generated the flood event. On 1 March 2006. extreme rainfall occurred in the Makanya catchment. (300 km2). where up to 100 mm were recorded in Bangalala village in only 3 h. The flood was devastating. inundating large parts of the flood plain. The spatial variability of the rainfall during the event was very large. even in areas with the same altitude. The Vudee sub-catchment (25.8 km2) was in the centre of the rainfall event. receiving about 75 mm in 3 h divided over the two upstream tributaries: the Upper-Vudee and Ndolwa. The peak flow at the weir site has been determined using the slope-area method and gradually varied flow calculations. indicating a peak discharge of 32 m3 s−1. Rise and fall of the flood was very sharp. with the peak flow occurring just one hour after the peak of the rainfall. The flow receded to 1% of the maximum flow within 24 h. Hydrograph separation using hydrochemical parameters indicates that at the floodpeak 50% of the flow was generated by direct surface runoff (also indicated by the large amount of sediments in the samples). whereas the recession originated from displaced groundwater (>90%). The subsequent base flow in the river remained at 75 l s−1 for the rest of the season. which is substantially higher than the normal base flow observed during the previous rainy seasons (15 l s−1 …,True,IkmNrdMAAAAJ:Vztgr1qGG8IC,47,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/13/1659/2009/,12571683641978322376,/scholar?cites=12571683641978322376,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/13/1659/2009/hess-13-1659-2009.pdf,0,0,0

Spate uses water (flood water). which upstream users often do not require. as rainfall during these periods is more than sufficient. The use of this flood water for spate irrigation is therefore a good opportunity to convert water with a low opportunity cost to high value water. As more rivers are closing. due to socio-economic and climate changes. spate irrigation may become increasingly relevant in semi-arid areas. Spate irrigation systems pose institutional and technical challenges: collective action is challenged by complex upstream–downstream interactions between users within the system. and the high labour demands for regular reconstruction of temporary diversion weirs and intake structures.

Often the main focus is on the blue water resources. as information on spatially distributed evaporative water use is not as readily available as the link to river flows. Physically based. spatially distributed models are often used to generate this kind of information. These models require enormous amounts of data. which can result in equifinality. making them less suitable for scenario analyses. Furthermore. hydrological models often focus on natural processes and fail to account for anthropogenic influences. This study presents a spatially distributed hydrological model that has been developed for a heterogeneous. highly utilized and data-scarce river basin in eastern Africa. Using an innovative approach. remote-sensing-derived evapotranspiration and soil moisture variables for 3 years were incorporated as input data into the Spatial Tools for River basin Environmental Analysis and Management (STREAM) model. To cater for the extensive irrigation water application. an additional blue water component (Qb) was incorporated in the STREAM model to quantify irrigation water use. To enhance model parameter identification and calibration. three hydrological landscapes (wetlands. hillslope and snowmelt) were identified using field data. The model was calibrated against discharge data from five gauging stations and showed good performance. especially in the simulation of low flows. where the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency of the natural logarithm (Ens_ln) of discharge were greater than 0.6 in both calibration and validation periods.

1160247,Determining spatial variability of dry spells: a Markov-based method. applied to the Makanya catchment. Tanzania,2013,BMC Fischer and ML Mul and HHG Savenije,17,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,6,2161-2170,Copernicus GmbH,With a growing world population and a trend towards more resource-intensive diets. pressure on land and water resources for food production will continue to increase in the coming decades. Large parts of the world rely on rainfed agriculture for their food security. In Africa. 90% of the food production is from rainfed agriculture. generally with low yields and a high risk of crop failure. One of the main reasons for crop failure is the occurrence of dry spells during the growing season. Key indicators are the critical dry spell duration and the probability of dry spell occurrence. In this paper a new Markov-based framework is presented to spatially map the length of dry spells for fixed probabilities of non-exceedance. The framework makes use of spatially varying Markov coefficients that are correlated to readily available spatial information such as elevation and distance to the sea. The dry spell map thus obtained is compared to the spatially variable critical dry spell duration. based on soil properties and crop water requirements. to assess the probability of crop failure in different locations. The results show that in the Makanya catchment the length of dry spell occurrence is highly variable in space. even over relatively short distances. In certain areas the probability of crop failure reaches levels that make rainfed agricultural unsustainable. even close to areas where currently rainfed agriculture is successfully being practised.

1160248,Can we trust remote sensing evapotranspiration products over Africa?,2020,Imeshi Weerasinghe and Wim Bastiaanssen and Marloes Mul and Li Jia and Ann van Griensven,24,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,3,1565-1586,Copernicus GmbH, Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important components in the water cycle. However. there are relatively few direct measurements of ET available (e.g. using flux towers). Nevertheless. various disciplines. ranging from hydrology to agricultural and climate sciences. require information on the spatial and temporal distribution of ET at regional and global scales. Due to the limited data availability. attention has turned toward satellite-based products to fill observational gaps. Various data products. including remote sensing (RS) products. have been developed and provide a large range of ET estimations. Across Africa. only a limited number of flux towers are available; hence. they are insufficient for the systematic evaluation of the available ET products. Thus. in this study. we conduct a methodological evaluation of nine existing RS-derived ET products as well as other available ET products in order to evaluate their reliability at the basin scale. A general water balance (WB) approach is used. where ET is equal to precipitation minus discharge for long-term averages. Firstly. ET products are compared with WB-inferred ET (ETWB) for basins that do not show long-term trends. The ET products and the calculated ETWB are then evaluated against the Budyko equation. which is used as a reference condition. The spatial characteristics of the ET products are finally assessed via the analysis of selected land cover elements across Africa: forests. irrigated areas and water bodies. Additionally. a cluster analysis is conducted to identify similarities between individual ET products. The results show that CMRSET.

1160254,Adsorption of chromium (VI) from aqueous solution by acacia tree (Acacia tortilis) charcoal,2016,Cecilia Muriuki and Urbanus Mutwiwa and Patrick Home and Fidelis Kilonzo,,,,,JKUAT,The adsorption of chromium (VI) ions from aqueous solution by charcoal from acacia (Acacia tortilis) tree were studied in a batch adsorption system. Various parameters such as the effect of initial chromium concentrations. pH. and contact time on Cr (VI) removal were investigated. The removal of Cr (VI) ions was observed to increase with contact time. and reduced with increasing initial chromium concentration. The optimum pH for chromium (VI) removal was attained between pH 5.0 and 6.0. Simulation kinetic models results showed that the pseudo-second–order kinetic model (R2>0.983) best describes the kinetic sorption of Cr (VI) ions onto the acacia charcoal. Moreover. the Langmuir and Freundlich models agreed very well with experimental data with a regression coefficient of 0.999 and 0.998. respectively. Desorption studies using nitric acid (HNO3) indicated high capability of chromium regeneration with desorption of higher than 92% being observed. Use of acacia tree charcoal for adsorption of Cr (VI) ions in this study exhibited high potentials for chromium ions removal from aqueous solution. These results suggest that acacia tree charcoal can be employed as an efficient adsorption for Cr (VI) removal in contaminated waters and can be utilized for recovery of chromium.

1160264,Distributed Validation of Hydrological Model Using Field and Remotely Sensed Data,2012,F Kilonzo and Ann Van Griensven and Willy Bauwens,,,,,,The assessment of the performance of (semi) distributed hydrological models has traditionally depended on parameters monitored at a gauging station usually located at the lowest end of a basin regardless of the size. complexity and spatial-temporal variations. The result of such an approach is that the processes in the basin are lumped by composting the catchment processes over time and space. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model gives various outputs which are distributed all over the basin by use of the hydrologic response units (HRU). However. due to lack of physical location for the hydrological response unit. and their possible large number in a single watershed or even subbasin. it is physically impossible to monitor the flow. nutrients and sediments at all the outlets of these HRUs. The use of geographic information system (GIS) to overlay datasheets and the availability of gridded remotely sensed data for biomass. evapotranspiration. leaf area index (LAI) and yields in real time makes it possible to perform a dynamic quasi-distributed model validation. The SWAT model is used to test the applicability of remotely sensed variables on a 2905 Km2 basin. The watershed is data challenged. geologically difficult. with dynamic land management practices. elevations from 800m to 3000m above sea level. and drastically changing climatic conditions from semi-arid to humid tundra/montane conditions.

The Native American populations have lower genetic diversity and greater differentiation than populations from other continental regions. We observe gradients both of decreasing genetic diversity as a function of geographic distance from the Bering Strait and of decreasing genetic similarity to Siberians—signals of the southward dispersal of human populations from the northwestern tip of the Americas. We also observe evidence of: (1) a higher level of diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America compared to eastern South America.

We first simulate a range expansion in a virtual world consisting in a two-dimensional array of demes exchanging a given proportion of migrants (m) with their neighbors. The recorded demographic and migration histories are then used under a coalescent approach to generate the genetic diversity in a sample of genes. We find that the shape of the gene genealogies and the overall pattern of diversity within demes depend not only on the age of the expansion but also on the level of gene flow between neighboring demes. as measured by the product Nm. where N is the size of a deme.

Although most genetic data support the view that our species originated recently in Africa. it is still unclear if it completely replaced former members of the Homo genus. or if some interbreeding occurred during its range expansion. Several scenarios of modern human evolution have been proposed on the basis of molecular and paleontological data. but their likelihood has never been statistically assessed.

However. no genome-wide characterization of admixture across Latin America has yet been attempted. Here. we report an analysis of admixture in thirteen Mestizo populations (i.e. in regions of mainly European and Native settlement) from seven countries in Latin America based on data for 678 autosomal and 29 X-chromosome microsatellites. We found extensive variation in Native American and European ancestry (and generally low levels of African ancestry) among populations and individuals. and evidence that admixture across Latin America has often involved predominantly European men and both Native and African women. An admixture analysis allowing for Native American population subdivision revealed a differentiation of the Native American ancestry amongst Mestizos. This observation is consistent with the genetic structure of pre-Columbian populations and with admixture having involved Natives from the area where the Mestizo examined are located. Our findings agree with available information on the demographic history of Latin America and have a number of implications for the design of association studies in population from the region.,True,_whK8xMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,469,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000037,15810202036244640149,/scholar?cites=15810202036244640149,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000037,0,0,0

The global LGM map was produced from a range of literature and map sources. and drawn on a GIS with topographic information. Extended coastlines due to LGM sea-level drop were obtained using bathymetric information. The map is available in image and Geographic Information System (GIS) formats. on a global or regional basis. Accompanying each regional map is a bibliography detailing the principal literature sources of evidence on Late Quaternary palaeovegetation and climates. The maps presented here are merely a preliminary attempt at appraisal of current knowledge and opinion. and future updated versions are intended as more information on LGM environments becomes available. Nevertheless. together with the accompanying citation summary they should provide a valuable and readily accessible source of information on current opinion in the Quaternary community. It is also hoped that the maps will themselves act as a catalyst for archaeologists to use their own data to contribute to the broader climatic/palaeovegetational picture.,True,_whK8xMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,320,https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:17817,17266078806016795772,/scholar?cites=17266078806016795772,,https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:17817/ATTACHMENT01,0,0,0

Europeans and Native Americans. a process taking place within the context of extensive geographic and social stratification. We estimated individual ancestry proportions in a sample of 7.342 subjects ascertained in five countries (Brazil. Chile. Colombia. México and Perú). These individuals were also characterized for a range of physical appearance traits and for self-perception of ancestry. The geographic distribution of admixture proportions in this sample reveals extensive population structure. illustrating the continuing impact of demographic history on the genetic diversity of Latin America. Significant ancestry effects were detected for most phenotypes studied. However. ancestry generally explains only a modest proportion of total phenotypic variation. Genetically estimated and self-perceived ancestry correlate significantly. but certain physical attributes have a strong impact on self-perception and bias self-perception of ancestry relative to genetically estimated ancestry.,True,_whK8xMAAAAJ:c2LjitseEfMC,306,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572,4456816029492423090,/scholar?cites=4456816029492423090,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004572,0,0,0

A geographical information system (GIS) was used to compile a landuse map. from which permeability estimates (friction) were derived. Potential migration zones based on friction and maximum migration distance were then modeled. Contacts between several migration zones suggest the potential for migration between ponds by adult individuals. The ability of the migration zones to enhance predictions of species occurrence was tested using generalized additive models (GAMs). and several landscape variables were selected as determinants of amphibian presence. The area of a migration zone and the number of ponds within that zone were positively related to both toad and newt presence. suggesting the importance of buffer habitats …,True,_whK8xMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,279,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021390527698,693045168319217667,/scholar?cites=693045168319217667,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42206361/Modelling_spatial_distribution_of_amphib20160206-14055-dii0nx.pdf,0,0,0

This program is dedicated to the study of the role of the environment on the spatial genetic structure of populations. Punctual locations (e.g. individuals) or zones encompassing sample data points (e.g. demes) are used in conjunction with a species‐specific friction map representing the cost of movement through the landscape.

Here the effect of landscape on dispersal was investigated in a forest-dwelling species. the American marten (Martes americana) using the genetic model of isolation by distance (IBD). This model assumes isotropic dispersal in a homogeneous environment and is characterized by increasing genetic differentiation among individuals separated by increasing geographic distances. The effect of landscape features on this genetic pattern was used to test for a departure from spatially homogeneous dispersal. This study was conducted on two populations in homogeneous vs. heterogeneous habitat in a harvested boreal forest in Ontario (Canada).

However. unlike range expansions. the molecular consequences of these processes have been little investigated. In order to fill this gap. we simulated patterns of molecular diversity within and between populations for various types of range contractions and range shifts. We show that range contractions tend to decrease genetic diversity as compared with population with stable ranges but quite counterintuitively fast range contractions preserve higher levels of diversity and induce lower levels of genetic differentiation among refuge areas than slow contractions. Contrastingly. fast range shifts lead to lower levels of diversity than slow range shifts. At odds with our expectations. we find that species actively migrating toward refuge areas can only preserve higher levels of diversity in refugia …,True,_whK8xMAAAAJ:DCYT7yIMjgYC,181,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-abstract/29/1/207/1749042,9433639276560599132,/scholar?cites=9433639276560599132,,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/29/1/207/1749042,0,0,0
