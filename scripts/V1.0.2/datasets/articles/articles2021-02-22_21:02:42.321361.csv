Development of PEM is due to insufficient nutrition. Children with PEM lose their resistance to infections because of a disordered immune system. It has been reported that the changes occurring in mediators referred to as cytokines in the immune system may be indicators of the disorders associated with PEM.Aims: To determine the concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in children with PEM. and to find out whether there was an association with the clinical presentation of PEM.Methods: The levels of serum total protein. albumin. tumour necrosis factor-α. and interleukin-6 were measured in 25 patients with PEM and in 18 healthy children as a control group. PEM was divided into two groups as kwashiorkor and marasmus. The kwashiorkor group consisted of 15 children and the marasmus group consisted of 10 children.Results: Levels of serum total protein and albumin of the kwashiorkor group were significantly lower than both the marasmus group and controls  ().  In view of tumour necrosis factor-α levels. there was no difference between groups  ().  While levels of interleukin-6 in both the marasmus group and the kwashiorkor group were significantly higher compared with controls  ().  there was no significant difference between the groups of marasmus and kwashiorkor  ().Conclusions: It was observed that the inflammatory response had increased in children with malnutrition.,True,RwD-G1kAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,79,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2002/943762/abs/,12846229483980998223,/scholar?cites=12846229483980998223,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2002/943762.pdf,0,0,0

The purpose of this research was to determine whether tadalafil exhibits a preventive effect on sepsis in a septic model induced in rats with cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).  Materials and Methods  Rats were randomly separated into groups. 10 rats in each: (i) a sham (control) group. (ii) an untreated sepsis group. (iii) a sepsis group treated with 5mg/kg tadalafil and (iv) a sepsis group treated with 10mg/kg tadalafil. A polymicrobial sepsis model was induced in rats using CLP. Rats were sacrificed after 16h. and blood and kidney tissues were collected for biochemical and histopathological study.  Results  Levels of the inflammatory parameter IL-6 decreased significantly in the sepsis groups receiving tadalafil in comparison with the untreated sepsis group (p<0.05). In terms of histopathology. inflammation scores investigated in kidney tissues decreased significantly in the sepsis groups receiving tadalafil compared to the untreated sepsis group (p<0.05). In addition. levels of creatinine and cystatin C measured in septic rats receiving tadalafil were lower by a clear degree than in septic rats (p<0.05).

For this purpose. the urinary levels of markers of renal tubular function. namely leucine amino peptidase (LAP). gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). alkaline phosphatase (ALP). lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2 microglobulin (beta-2M). and urinary albumin as a predictor of renal glomerular function were measured before and after sevoflurane anaesthesia.Methods: This study was comprised of 20 patients (11 males and nine females) aged 18–55. who underwent various elective surgical procedures under general anaesthesia. Urine samples of all patients were collected before and 1. 2 and 8 h after the anaesthesia. The levels of LAP. GGT. beta-2M. and albumin were then expressed as factored by urinary creatinine. In all patients. the anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (2% end-tidal) at a high flow-rate (6 L/min).Results: Urinary beta-2M and LAP levels after anaesthesia were unchanged (P> 0.05). While urinary GGT and ALP levels were found elevated in the first hour. LDH levels were higher in the second hour (P< 0.05). They returned to normal levels in the later periods after the anaesthesia. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was significantly elevated in the second hour after the anaesthesia (P< 0.001). Although UAE was decreased in the eighth hour after the anaesthesia. it still remained higher than the pre-anaesthesia level (P< 0.001).

The product label of sunitinib carries a boxed warning for idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity; however. the mechanisms of this toxicity remain unclear. Recent studies suggest that cytochrome P450‐mediated bioactivation may play a role in sunitinib‐induced liver injury. We have previously shown that CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 catalyze the metabolic activation of sunitinib via oxidative defluorination leading to formation of a chemically reactive. potentially toxic quinoneimine metabolite. which was trapped as a glutathione (GSH) conjugate.

1050787,The influence of methylsulfonylmethane on inflammation-associated cytokine release before and following strenuous exercise,2016,Mariè van der Merwe and Richard J Bloomer,2016,Journal of sports medicine,,,Hindawi,Background. Inflammation is associated with strenuous exercise and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Methods. Physically active men were supplemented with either placebo or MSM (3 grams per day) for 28 days before performing 100 repetitions of eccentric knee extension exercise. Ex vivo and in vitro testing consisted of evaluating cytokine production in blood (whole blood and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). before and through 72 hours after exercise. while in vivo testing included the evaluation of cytokines before and through 72 hours after exercise. Results. LPS stimulation of whole blood after MSM supplementation resulted in decreased induction of IL-1β. with no effect on IL-6. TNF-α. or IL-8. After exercise. there was a reduced response to LPS in the placebo. but MSM resulted in robust release of IL-6 and TNF-α. A small decrease in resting levels of proinflammatory cytokines was noted with MSM. while an acute postexercise increase in IL-10 was observed with MSM. Conclusion. Strenuous exercise causes a robust inflammatory reaction that precludes the cells from efficiently responding to additional stimuli. MSM appears to dampen the release of inflammatory molecules in response to exercise. resulting in a less incendiary environment. allowing cells to still have the capacity to mount an appropriate response to an additional stimulus after exercise.,True,exVTYPEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,29,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsm/2016/7498359/abs/,1929929743142491249,/scholar?cites=1929929743142491249,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsm/2016/7498359/abs/,0,0,0

Manuka honey was incorporated into electrospun templates with large (1.7–2.2 µm) and small (0.25–0.5 µm) diameter fibers at concentrations of 0.1%. 1%. and 10%. Template pore sizes and honey release profiles were quantified. and the effect on the NETosis response of seeded human neutrophils was examined through fluorescence imaging and myeloperoxidase (MPO) analysis. The incorporation of 0.1% and 1% Manuka honey decreased NETosis on the template surface at both 3 and 6 h. while 10% honey exacerbated the NETosis response. Additionally. 0.1% and 1% Manuka honey reduced the MMP-9 release of the neutrophils at both timepoints. These data indicate a therapeutic window for Manuka honey incorporation into tissue engineering templates for the reduction in NETosis. Future in vivo experimentation should be conducted to translate these results to a physiological wound environment.

However. agriculture still faces estimated crop yield losses ranging from 25% to 40% annually. These losses arise not only because of direct feeding damage. but also because many pests serve as vectors of plant viruses. Herbivorous thrips (Thysanoptera) are important pests of vegetable and ornamental crops worldwide. and encompass virtually all general problems of pests: they are highly polyphagous. hard to control because of their complex lifestyle. and they are vectors of destructive viruses. Currently. control management of thrips mainly relies on the use of chemical pesticides. However. thrips rapidly develop resistance to these pesticides.

Effectors typically function by associating with host molecules and modulating their activities. This study aimed to identify the host processes targeted by the RXLR class of host-translocated effectors of the potato blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans. To this end. we performed an in planta protein-protein interaction screen by transiently expressing P. infestans RXLR effectors in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves followed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This screen generated an effector-host protein interactome matrix of 59 P. infestans RXLR effectors x 586 N. benthamiana proteins. Classification of the host interactors into putative functional categories revealed over 35 biological processes possibly targeted by P. infestans.

PexRD31. increased the number of FYVE positive vesicles in N. benthamiana cells. FYVE positive vesicles also accumulated in leaf cells near P. infestans hyphae. indicating that the pathogen may enhance endosomal trafficking during infection.

1050892,A robust functional genomics approach to identify effector genes required for thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) reproductive performance on tomato leaf discs,2018,Ahmed M Abd-El-Haliem and Suzanne W Hoogstrate and Robert C Schuurink,9,Frontiers in plant science,,1852,Frontiers,Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) is a persistent plant pest that is able to vector pathogenic viruses. Natural plant resistance to thrips has become a prominent breeding target in commercial crops. The main reason for this is the shift towards banning key pesticides used for controlling thrips infestations and the lack of effective alternatives. Despite this urgent need for crop plants that are resistant. or tolerant. to thrips infestation. the toolbox for studying genetic resistance to this insect is still underdeveloped. Essentially. there is a lack of robust protocols for the screening and identification of thrips genes relevant to its performance on crop plants. To bridge this gap. we have developed a functional analysis screening method. Our approach relies on the. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated. homogeneous and transient ectopic expression of thrips genes in large tomato leaf discs followed by the assessment of thrips reproductive performance. The setup is designed to maintain gene expression during the course of the assay. where GFP signal in the control treatment is used as a reporter of expression. The screen is conducted in a climate box under controlled settings. As a result. multiple genes can be screened for their effect on thrips reproductive performance in a single experiment and in a relatively small space. without the need for generating stable transgenic plants. The method also eliminates the need for a greenhouse equipped to accommodate the combination of A. tumefaciens-infiltrations and thrips infestations.

1050902,The role of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase-C in plant defense signaling,2014,Ahmed M Abd-El-Haliem,,,,-,,Plant innate immunity requires immune receptors that sense the presence of microbes and activate defense reactions. Phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity was previously shown to be important for several types of plant defenses although its signaling mechanism is not fully understood. It is also not clear why plants possess several PI-PLC isoforms and how triggering immune receptors activates them. PI-PLC activation induces a transient release of free cytosolic Ca2+ and the turnover of specific low abundant signaling phospholipids in the plasma membrane. Both events are important signals in animals and plants. Here. the first genetic evidence linking PI-PLC signaling to plant defense against pathogens is provided. The structure of the tomato PI-PLC family was determined. the corresponding genes were cloned and the function of individual isoforms during defense was studied. We found that PLC4 and PLC6 encode active enzymes and that they have distinct roles in defense. Optimum activity requirements and substrate preferences were determined for three PI-PLC enzymes and their enzyme activity was found to be important for immune receptor-activated responses. The available information was used to draw a model explaining the role of PI-PLC signaling in immune receptor-mediated defense and resistance in plants. ,True,PsflB6cAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/477150,,,,https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/fulltext/315798,0,0,0

1050907,The role of phospholipid signalling in the defence of plants against pathogens,2007,JH Vossen and A Abd-El-Haliem and WIL Tameling and MHAJ Joosten,,,,96,,Plants are sessile organisms and need to respond quickly to environmental stresses. The innate immune system of plants allows sensing the presence of pathogens. resulting in a defence response that prevents infection. Elicitors produced by the pathogen are specifically recognized by host-encoded receptorlike resistance (R) proteins. The R_protein Cf-4 from tomato is responsible for the recognition of the Avr4 protein elicitor produced by the leaf mold fungus Cladosporium fulvum. The receptor-like part of the Cf-4 protein. consisting of leucine rich repeats. is on the outside of the cell (where it can mediate recognition of Avr4). whereas the remainder. a short C-terminal stretch of amino acids. is inside the cell (where it is thought to initiate a defence response). Our group studies the early signalling processes that are initiated by Cf-4 inside the cell after Avr4 recognition. It was found that a very early response of Cf-4-expressing cells (within five minutes after exposure to Avr4) is the activation of two enzymes involved in phospholipid signalling; phospholipase-C (PLC) and diacylglycerol kinase (DGK). As a result of this activation. phosphatidic acid (PA) rapidly accumulates which could act as a second messenger able to initiate responses further downstream. We revealed that PLC and DGK are required for an effective defence response to C. fulvum. Accordingly. we aim to identify and characterise the PLC and DGK gene families of tomato. The identified genes will be individually silenced or over-expressed and the effect of such manipulation on disease resistance will be studied. Once the key members of the PLC and DGK families playing a role in …,True,PsflB6cAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://research.wur.nl/en/publications/the-role-of-phospholipid-signalling-in-the-defence-of-plants-agai,,,,,0,0,0

Tokyo,Cryptochromes are blue-light photoreceptors involved in a variety of signaling pathways in both plants and animals. including blue light-dependent growth. development and entrainment of circadian rhythms. They are characterized by their significant amino acid sequence similarity to photolyases. particularly in the N-terminal chromophore binding and catalytic domain ([Ahmad 2003]). Many of the amino acids known to function inflavin binding are conserved in the cryp- tochromes. which apparently bind to the same chromophores as do photolyases ([Lin et al 1995]). In addition. most cryptochromes have poorly conserved C- terminal extensions that are thought to interact with downstream cellular sig- naling intermediates such as transcription factors. It has been proposed that a light-induced intramolecular redox reaction may trigger conformational changes in the protein ([Yang et al 2000]).

Styrene epoxide formation and styrene epoxide hydration have been studied in liver. lung. kidney. heart. spleen and brain of female and male rats.2. Styrene epoxide formation is NADPH-dependent although it is enhanced when NADH is added together with NADP.

PARTICIPATION OF CYP ISOENZYMES IN THE METABOLISM OF ENDOGENOUS SUBSTANCES AND DRUGS,2008,Piotr Tomaszewski and GRAŘYNA KUBIAK-TOMASZEWSKA and Jan Pachecka,,,,,,In the human organism 58 cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes belonging to 18 families have been described. These hemoproteins. with enzymatic activity characteristic for monooxygenases. show a broad affinity for chemically differentiated endo-or exogenous compounds. including drugs. CYP isoenzymes participate in metabolic pathways important for proper physiological functioning of the human organism. ie: cholesterol. bile acid and oxysterol biosynthesis; metabolism of fatty acids. prostaglandins. prostacyclins. leukotrienes. steroid hormones. ketone bodies. vitamines A and D. CYP isoenzymes participate in the metabolism of over 80% of drugs and other xenobiotic substances which can be present in the human organism. Differences in molecular structure and kinetics of conformational changes of particular isoenzymes of CYP superfamily monooxygenases on the one hand determine their affinity direction for chemically differentiated groups of compounds susceptible to oxidation. on the other hand determine the mechanism and position of the oxidative change of their molecules. Drugs and their metabolites and other endogenous and xenobiotic compounds may be acting not only as substrates. but also as competitive and non-competitive inhibitors. suicide inhibitors and inducers of CYP isoenzymes as well as repressors of CYP genes.

However. we have been unable to prepare analytically pure p-TBA. because the boronic acid moiety of p-TBA generally undergoes dehydration upon simple heating to form semi-anhydride [mixture of acid (monomer) and anhydride (trimer)]. or pure anhydride. 4 The formation of semi-anhydride was observed in connection with the purification of p-TBA by recrystallization from hot water. Snyder et al. 5 reported that the formation of anhydride sometimes occurs if aryl boronic acids are simply warmed in an anhydrous solvent. like CCl4 or CHCl3. There is another example that an aryl boronic acid forms the corresponding anhydride. as evidenced by Gilman et al. for o-hydroxybenzeneboronic acid. 6 However. pure anhydride of p-TBA has not been obtained to our knowledge. To separate and classify a boronic acid and its anhydride from each other and from mixtures of both. several aryl boronic acids and its anhydrides. including p-TBA. were investigated by IR spectroscopy. 5 These types of characterizations of aryl boronic acids including the corresponding anhydrides have not yet been studied by 1H and 11B NMR.,True,K9vduTwAAAAJ:tzM49s52ZIMC,39,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analsci/18/3/18_3_363/_article/-char/ja/,7984093175919323228,/scholar?cites=7984093175919323228,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/analsci/18/3/18_3_363/_pdf,0,0,0

U kobiet ciężarnych hiperhomocysteinemia dodatkowo stanowi czynnik ryzyka powstawania nadciśnienia oraz wad cewy nerwowej u płodu. Podwyższony poziom homocysteiny występuje u pacjentów z przewlekłą niewydolnością nerek. niedoczynnością tarczycy. różnymi typami nowotworów. niedokrwistością złośliwą. schorzeniami wątroby. ale również u osób wykazujących niedobory żywieniowe. szczególnie kwasu foliowego. Ocenia się. że obniżenie stężenia homocysteiny w osoczu krwi o 25%. może spowodować spadek ryzyka choroby niedokrwiennej serca o 11%. udaru mózgu o 19% oraz znacznie obniżyć częstość występowania wad rozwojowych płodu. Do chwili obecnej nie ma jednoznacznych ustaleń co do metody leczenia hiperhomocysteinemii. Uważa się. że kluczem do obniżenia stężenia homocysteiny w osoczu krwi będzie suplementacja witaminami B6.

1051008,The neuromodulation aspects of ischaemic myocardium: the importance of cholinergic system,1995,M Gajewski and JA Moutiris and S Maslinski and J Ryzewski,46,,2,,-,The ability of the heart to increase contractility and heart rate is facilitated by postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings that terminate within myocardium. In fact. the heart is often regarded as an “adrenergic” organ because f-adrenergic agonists are powerful stimulants of cardiac contractility. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate parasympathetic control of heart function. A primary effects of the muscarinic stimulation are opposite to those of ß-adrenergic stimulation. The modulation of an adrenergic receptors stimulation in the heart by cholinergic agonists may be the major means by which the muscarinic agonists alter heart function. When the hypoxic myocytes were exposed to adrenaline. the responsiveness of the cardiac cells to muscarinic stimuli had significantly increased. and a simultaneous potent increase in the expression of muscarinic receptors was observed. These result support the hypothesis that in ischaemic/hypoxic myocardium the role of cholinergic system may be more important than previously assumed. In this review an attempt was made to summarize the physiological and biochemical interactions in an autonomic nervous system. in an ischaemic myocardium.

The neural crest (NC) gives rise to many derivatives including the neurons and glia of the sensory and autonomic ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. enteric neurons and glia. melanocytes. and the cartilaginous. bony and connective tissue of the craniofacial skeleton. cephalic neuroendocrine organs. and some heart vessels.  Methodology/Principal Findings We present evidence that neural crest (NC) competence can be acquired very early when human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are selectively neuralized towards dorsal neuroepithelium in the absence of feeder cells in fully defined conditions. When hESC-derived neurospheres are plated on fibronectin. some cells emigrate onto the substrate. These early migratory Neural Crest Stem Cells (emNCSCs) uniformly upregulate Sox10 and vimentin. downregulate N-cadherin. and remodel F-actin. consistent with a transition from neuroepithelium to a mesenchymal NC cell. Over 13% of emNCSCs upregulate CD73. a marker of mesenchymal lineage characteristic of cephalic NC and connexin 43. found on early migratory NC cells. We demonstrated that emNCSCs give rise in vitro to all NC lineages. are multipotent on clonal level. and appropriately respond to developmental factors.

ACC: dissociation of the cells with Accutase and freezing in cryovials. and PLT: programmed freezing of adherent cells in plastic multiwell dishes in a programmable freezer using one- and multistep cooling protocols. Four CPAs were tesetd: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). ethylene glycol (EG). propylene glycol (PG). and glycerol (GLY). The cells in ACC and PLT were frozen and recovered after thawing in the presence of a ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (RI). EG was less toxic w/o CP cryopreservation than DMSO and allowed much better maintenance of pluripotency after CP than PG or GLY. The cells were cryopreserved very efficiently as adherent cultures (+RI) in plates (5-6-fold higher than STD) using EG and a 6-step freezing protocol. Recovery under these conditions is comparable or even higher than ACC+RI. Conclusions. Maintenance of cell-substratum adherence is a favorable environment that mitigates freezing and thawing stresses (ComfortFreeze® concept developed by CELLTRONIX). CP of cells directly in plates in ready-to-go after thawing format for HT/HC screening can be beneficial in many SC-related scientific and commercial applications such as drug discovery and toxicity tests.,True,5hYPzdYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,51,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2011/981606/abs/,2530155327207110190,/scholar?cites=2530155327207110190,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2011/981606/abs/,0,0,0

Efficient differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into neural precursor cells is critical for future cell-based therapies. Here. using defined conditions. we characterized a new method for rapid and uniform differentiation of hESCs into committed neural precursor cells (designated C-NPCs). Dynamic gene expression analysis identified several distinct stages of ESC neuralization and revealed functional modules of coregulated genes and pathways.

During development most DP cells are derived from mesoderm. however. functionally equivalent DP cells of cephalic hairs originate from Neural Crest (NC). Here we directed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to generate first NC cells and then hair-inducing DP-like cells in culture. We showed that hESC-derived DP-like cells (hESC-DPs) express markers typically found in adult human DP cells (e.g. p-75. nestin. versican. SMA. alkaline phosphatase) and are able to induce hair follicle formation when transplanted under the skin of immunodeficient NUDE mice. Engineered to express GFP. hESC-derived DP-like cells incorporate into DP of newly formed hair follicles and express appropriate markers. We demonstrated that BMP signaling is critical for hESC-DP derivation since BMP inhibitor dorsomorphin completely eliminated hair-inducing activity from hESC-DP cultures. DP cells were proposed as the cell-based treatment for hair loss diseases. Unfortunately human DP cells are not suitable for this purpose because they cannot be obtained in necessary amounts and rapidly loose their ability to induce hair follicle formation when cultured. In this context derivation of functional hESC-DP cells capable of inducing a robust hair growth for the first time shown here can become an important finding for the biomedical science.,True,5hYPzdYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,40,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116892,14533208322513383592,/scholar?cites=14533208322513383592,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0116892,0,0,0

Lactoferrin’s main function is non-immune protection. Among several protective activities shown by lactoferrin. those displayed by orally administered lactoferrin are:(i) antimicrobial activity. which has been presumed due to iron deprivation. but more recently attributed also to a specific interaction with the bacterial cell wall and extended to viruses and parasites;(ii) immunomodulatory activity. with a direct effect on the development of the immune system in the newborn. together with a specific antinflammatory effects;(iii) a more recently discovered anticancer activity. It is worth noting that most of the protective activities of lactoferrin have been found. sometimes to a greater extent. also in peptides derived from limited proteolysis of lactoferrin that could be generated after lactoferrin ingestion. Lactoferrin could therefore be considered an ideal nutraceutic product because of its relatively cheap production from bovine milk and of its widely recognized tolerance after ingestion. along with its well demonstrated protective activities.

This prodrug is activated by a mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme called KatG in Mycobacterium tuberculosis). thereby inhibiting the synthesis of mycolic acid. required for the mycobacterial cell wall. Moreover. isoniazid activation by KatG produces some radical species (e.g.. nitrogen monoxide). that display anti-mycobacterial activity. Remarkably. the ability of mycobacteria to persist in vivo in the presence of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species implies the presence in these bacteria of (pseudo-)enzymatic detoxification systems. including truncated hemoglobins (trHbs). Here. we report that isoniazid binds reversibly to ferric and ferrous M. tuberculosis trHb type N (or group I; Mt-trHbN(III) and Mt-trHbN(II). respectively) with a simple bimolecular process. which perturbs the heme-based spectroscopic properties. Values of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for isoniazid binding to Mt-trHbN(III) and Mt-trHbN(II) are K = (1.1±0.1)×10−4 M. kon = (5.3±0.6)×103 M−1 s−1 and koff = (4.6±0.5)×10−1 s−1; and D = (1.2±0.2)×10−3 M. don = (1.3±0.4)×103 M−1 s−1. and doff = 1.5±0.4 s−1. respectively. at pH 7.0 and 20.0°C. Accordingly. isoniazid inhibits competitively azide binding to Mt-trHbN(III) and Mt-trHbN(III)-catalyzed peroxynitrite isomerization.

Here. the allosteric effect of ibuprofen and warfarin on the local atomic structure around the ferric heme-Fe (heme-Fe(III)) atom of HSA-heme-Fe (HSA-heme-Fe(III)) has been probed by Fe-K edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The quantitative analysis of the Fe-K edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) signals and modeling of the near edge (XANES) spectral features demonstrated that warfarin and ibuprofen binding modify the local structure of the heme-Fe(III). Combined XAS data analysis and targeted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided atomic resolution insights of protein structural rearrangements required to accommodate the heme-Fe(III) upon ibuprofen and warfarin binding. In the absence of drugs. the heme-Fe(III) atom is penta-coordinated having distorted 4+1 configuration made by the nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin ring and the oxygen phenoxy atom of the Tyr161 residue. MD simulations show that ibuprofen and warfarin association to the secondary fatty acid (FA) binding site 2 (FA2) induces a reorientation of domain I of HSA-heme-Fe(III). this leads to the redirection of the His146 residue providing an additional bond to the heme-Fe(III) atom. providing the 5+1 configuration.

The objective of this experiment was to study the effects of cropping system and residues management on the yield and yield components of maize. The experiment was conducted at KPK Agricultural University. Peshawar during summer 2002 and was laid out in RCB design with split plot arrangement having four replications. Higher ear length and weight. grains ear-1. grain weight and grain and biological yields were recorded for legumecereal (chickpea-maize) cropping system followed by cereal-cereal (wheat-maize) cropping system with nitrogen application at the rate of 160 kg N ha-1 to the previous as well as current crops in both cases. However. these parameters were minimal for cereal-cereal (wheat-maize) cropping system with no nitrogen application either in the previous crop or in the current crop. Higher ear length and weight. grain ear-1. grain weight. grain and biological yields were recorded for the plots applied with FYM followed by the plots in which residues were incorporated. The plots in which no residues were incorporated performed poorly and resulted in least values of these parameters.

The central component of the glideosome. myosin A (MyoA). is a motor recruited at the pellicle by the acylated gliding-associated protein GAP45. In Toxoplasma gondii. GAP45 also contributes to the cohesion of the pellicle. composed of the inner membrane complex (IMC) and the plasma membrane. during motor traction. GAP70 was previously identified as a paralog of GAP45 that is tailored to recruit MyoA at the apical cap in the coccidian subgroup of the Apicomplexa. A third member of this family. GAP80. is demonstrated here to assemble a new glideosome. which recruits the class XIV myosin C (MyoC) at the basal polar ring. MyoC shares the same myosin light chains as MyoA and also interacts with the integral IMC proteins GAP50 and GAP40. Moreover. a central component of this complex. the IMC-associated protein 1 (IAP1). acts as the key determinant for the restricted localization of MyoC to the posterior pole. Deletion of specific components of the MyoC-glideosome underscores the installation of compensatory mechanisms with components of the MyoA-glideosome. Conversely. removal of MyoA leads to the relocalization of MyoC along the pellicle and at the apical cap that accounts for residual invasion. The two glideosomes exhibit a considerable level of plasticity to ensure parasite survival.,True,RUUYp34AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,65,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004504,2737080280634434750,/scholar?cites=2737080280634434750,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004504,0,0,0

1051159,Versatility in the acquisition of energy and carbon sources by the Apicomplexa,2010,Valerie Polonais and Dominique Soldati‐Favre,102,,8,435-445,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Members of the phylum Apicomplexa are motile and rapidly dividing intracellular parasites. able to occupy a large spectrum of niches by infecting diverse hosts and invading various cell types. As obligate intracellular parasites. most apicomplexans only survive for a short period extracellularly. and. during this time. have a high energy demand to power gliding motility and invasion into new host cells.

A key to the success of these obligate intracellular pathogens is their unique invasion organelle. the polar tube. which delivers the nucleus containing sporoplasm into host cells during invasion. Due to the size of the polar tube. the rapidity of polar tube discharge and sporoplasm passage. and the absence of genetic techniques for the manipulation of microsporidia. study of this organelle has been difficult and there is relatively little known regarding polar tube formation and the function of the proteins making up this structure. Herein. we have characterized polar tube protein 4 (PTP4) from the microsporidium Encephalitozoon hellem and found that a monoclonal antibody to PTP4 labels the tip of the polar tube suggesting that PTP4 might be involved in a direct interaction with host cell proteins during invasion. Further analyses employing indirect immunofluorescence (IFA). enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assays confirmed that PTP4 binds to mammalian cells. The addition of either recombinant PTP4 protein or anti-PTP4 antibody reduced microsporidian infection of its host cells in vitro. Proteomic analysis of PTP4 bound to host cell membranes purified by immunoprecipitation identified transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as a potential host cell interacting partner for PTP4.

MLC2. only found in coccidians. is associated with myosin D via its calmodulin (CaM)‐like domain and anchored to the plasma membrane of T. gondii via its N‐terminal extension. Molecular modeling suggests that the MyoD–MLC2 complex is more compact than the reported structure of Plasmodium MyoA–myosin A tail‐interacting protein (MTIP) complex.

1051210,Phosphorylation Bar Codes Induce Distinct Conformations and Functionalities of β-arrestin,2010,Kelly Nicole Nobles,,,,,,Seven transmembrane spanning receptors (7TMRs). or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). represent the largest and most ubiquitous of the several families of plasma membrane receptors and regulate virtually all known physiological processes in humans. The classical paradigm of signal transduction in response to 7TMR stimulation involves an agonistinduced conformational change of the receptor which leads to interaction with and dissociation of the heterotrimeric G-protein into independent Gα and Gβγ signaling subunits. Following their activation. 7TMRs are phosphorylated by G-protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and subsequently recruit β-arrestins. β-arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins which not only desensitize G-protein signals. but also facilitate receptor internalization and mediate numerous signaling pathways on their own. As β-arrestins universally interact with members of the 7TMR superfamily. we (1) developed an in vitro model system to assess conformational changes that occur in β-arrestins in response to phosphorylation and (2) to map the sites of phosphorylation on the β2 adrenergic receptor by different GRKs which would determine the conformation (s) assumed by β-arrestin and thereby. in turn. instruct its functional capabilities. We determined conformational changes in β-arrestin1 in vitro using limited tryptic proteolysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis in the presence of a phosphopeptides derived from the C-terminus of the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2Rpp or V2R4p) or the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (V2Rnp).

The photoactive soluble orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is essential for the triggering of this photoprotective mechanism.

Through targeted gene interruption we have now identified a protein that mediates the recovery of the full antenna capacity when irradiance decreases.

Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy allowed us to follow the process of energy dissipation in real time.

Long-term iron deficiency results in the formation of large IsiA aggregates. some of which associate with photosystem I (PSI) while others are not connected to a photosystem. The fluorescence at room temperature of these unconnected aggregates is strongly quenched. which points to a photoprotective function. In this study. we report time-resolved fluorescence measurements of IsiA aggregates at low temperatures. The average fluorescence lifetimes are estimated to be about 600 ps at 5 K and 150 ps at 80 K.

High plants and algae involve mechanism of state transitions which is regulated by the redox state of the plastoquinone pool and leads to the reversible redistribution of excitation energy between the two photosystems through a reorganization of the antennae and to an overall increase in photosynthetic quantum yield by decreasing the delivery of excess excitation energy to PSII while increasing delivery of excitation energy to PSI (or vice-versa)[1]. Cyanobacteria balance energy input and consumption differently. Under iron-deficient conditions. the content of PSI decreases substantially more than that of PSII [2]. Cyanobacteria respond to this condition by accumulation of IsiA protein which may occurs in two different types of complexes (associated and not associated with PSI) and correspondingly serve different functions [3]. The PSI-IsiA supercomplexes show increasingly larger amounts of bound IsiA proteins with increasing iron starvation. The largest particles consist of double IsiA ring around monomeric PSI and contain about 560 chlorophylls. which together with 96 chlorophylls of the PSI core complex would give a total number of 656 chlorophylls. PSI particles with such large antenna sizes have not been observed before. Fluorescence excitation spectra indicate an efficient light-harvesting function for all PSI-bound chlorophylls. With continious iron starvation the further decline of PSI makes PSII increasingly vulnerable to photooxidation and the surplus synthesis of IsiA not associated with PSI shields PSII from excess light.,True,Y1VWrmMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/functional-flexibility-of-light-harvesting-in-cyanobacteria(257e8a15-ee68-481f-ad03-2b1d90bec1d9).html,,,,,0,0,0

One such protein is Light-harvesting complex II (LHCII). In plants it is bound in its trimeric form to dimeric PSII. In spinach and Arabidopsis thaliana most dimers bind 2-4 LHCII trimers. We have characterized the PSI-LHCII complex from Arabidopsis membranes in state two by single particle electron microscopy at about 16 Å. PSI binds one trimer at the site of the PsaL and PsaK subunits. Cyanobacteria express large quantities of the Iron Stress Inducible protein IsiA under iron deficiency. IsiA can assemble into numerous types of single or double rings surrounding PS I. These supercomplexes are functional in light-harvesting. but empty IsiA rings are effective energy dissipators. Electron microscopy studies on over 130 000 particle projections of these supercomplexes show that photosystem I trimers find 18 IsiA copies in a single ring; whereas monomers may bind up to 35 copies in two rings. The double rings are formed by inner rings of 12. 13 or 14 copies and the outer ones of 19. 20 and 21 copies. respectively. This shows that IsiA can form a remarkable large variety of ring-like structures. Work on particles purified from mutants indicates that the PsaF and PsaL subunits facilitate the formation of closed rings around PSI monomers.

IsiA (iron-stress-inducible protein A) has been found as a ring of 18 subunits surrounding PSI trimers under limited stress conditions (Boekema et al.. Nature 2001. Bibby et al.. Nature 2001). Under prolonged iron deficiency. aggregates of many IsiA subunits are synthesized. some of them not associated with PSI (Yeremenko et al. Biochemistry 2004). We purified IsiA aggregates in the absence of PSI. and found that they contain chlorophyll a. ß-carotene and zeaxanthin. The IsiA aggregates show an extraordinary temperature dependence of the fluorescence emission yield at 687 nm. which was also observed in the membranes from which the aggregates were extracted. At room temperature. the fluorescence quantum yield of IsiA aggregates is much smaller than that of monomeric chlorophyll a in acetone. Time-resolved fluorescence experiments revealed a main lifetime for IsiA aggregates in the hundreds of pico-seconds time range.

In photosynthetic organisms. carotenoids are active in light-harvesting. photoprotection and structure organization1. 2. In general. the light-harvesting role can. despite being of great importance for the overall light-harvesting efficiency. be considered ancillary to the light-harvesting role of chlorophylls. Of vital importance for the survival of the photosynthetic organisms is the role of carotenoids in photoprotection3. Carotenoids quench harmful chlorophyll triplet states which are potential singlet oxygen sensitizers and are very effective scavengers of singlet oxygen2. This capacity relies on the low-lying carotenoid triplet state whose energy is close enough to effectively quench chlorophyll triplet states and singlet oxygen.Another pivotal role of carotenoids is in the quenching of chlorophyll singlet excited states under conditions of excess light illumination. a process generally known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) 4. 5. The potentially deleterious effect of excess light on a photosynthetic organism is just one example of how too much of a good thing can be extremely harmful. In fact the absorption of light in excess to that required for maximum CO2 fixation. would lead to the unnecessary formation of an excess of long living chlorophyll triplet states within the lightharvesting antenna. This condition can be very detrimental to the survival of the photosynthetic organism. since chlorophyll triplet states are excellent singlet oxygen sensitizers.

The reversible nature of the covalent-adduct formation was demonstrated with NMR saturation-transfer technique using a DANTE pulse for selective excitation. In addition the covalent adduct was displaced with an aldehyde inhibitor to regenerate the nitrile compound. No hydrolysis of the nitrile was observed. The covalent adduct is most likely a thioimidate formed between the essential thiol and the nitrile. Several p-nitroanilide substrates and their corresponding nitrile inhibitors were examined. A correlation between K i and k cat K m was observed. This finding together with the fact that the pH dependence of K i parallels that of k cat K m suggests that the interaction of nitriles and papain has considerable transition-state character.

Termination involves ligation of the transferred single strand by the plasmid-encoded MobA protein. Several different assays were used to identify the oriT DNA required for termination. For plasmids containing two oriTs. with transfer initiated at one and terminated at the other. the inverted repeat within oriT is important for termination. Deletion of the outer arm reduces the termination frequency; those terminations that do occur probably depend upon nicking at this oriT prior to transfer. The locations of second-site suppressor mutations indicate that base pairing between the arms of the inverted repeat is important for termination. In vitro. the inverted repeat is not required for specific cleavage of single-stranded DNA at nic. but competition experiments indicate that oriTs with the …,True,DD0UqaEAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,42,https://jb.asm.org/content/174/20/6659.short,13768515865252046633,/scholar?cites=13768515865252046633,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/174/20/6659.full.pdf,0,0,0

Faster growth and greater viability were observed in both broth and plates if the growth media were sterilized by microwave radiation rather than by autoclaving. One difference between autoclaved and microwaved media is that the autoclaved media are darker brown in color. which is known to be due to the Maillard reaction products. also known as Amadori products.

It has been observed that the changes of the microenvironment imposed upon them by the supporting matrix and by the products of their own action can alter the stability of enzymes and also their kinetic properties. The surface on which the enzyme is immobilized has several fundamental roles to play such as maintaining the tertiary structure of the enzyme by formation of electron transition complexes or by forming hydrogen or covalent bonds with the matrix (Goel. 1994). Therefore. proper selection of an attachment method between the reactive groups on the matrix surface and the residues outside the substrate binding or active site of the enzyme is key considerations in this technique (Tischer et al.. 1999).

We analyze a fission yeast mutant that is unable to complete S phase due to a defective subunit of the MCM helicase. Despite underreplicated and damaged DNA. these cells evade the G2 damage checkpoint to form ultrafine bridges. fragmented centromeres. and uneven chromosome segregations that resembles micronuclei. These micronuclei retain DNA damage markers and frequently rejoin with the parent nucleus. Surviving cells show an increased rate of mutation and chromosome rearrangement.

1051465,Managing single-stranded DNA during replication stress in fission yeast,2015,Sarah A Sabatinos and Susan L Forsburg,5,,3,2123-2139,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Replication fork stalling generates a variety of responses. most of which cause an increase in single-stranded DNA. ssDNA is a primary signal of replication distress that activates cellular checkpoints. It is also a potential source of genome instability and a substrate for mutation and recombination. Therefore. managing ssDNA levels is crucial to chromosome integrity. Limited ssDNA accumulation occurs in wild-type cells under stress. In contrast. cells lacking the replication checkpoint cannot arrest forks properly and accumulate large amounts of ssDNA. This likely occurs when the replication fork polymerase and helicase units are uncoupled. Some cells with mutations in the replication helicase (mcm-ts) mimic checkpoint-deficient cells. and accumulate extensive areas of ssDNA to trigger the G2-checkpoint. Another category of helicase mutant (mcm4-degron) causes fork stalling in early S-phase due to immediate loss of helicase function. Intriguingly. cells realize that ssDNA is present. but fail to detect that they accumulate ssDNA. and continue to divide. Thus. the cellular response to replication stalling depends on checkpoint activity and the time that replication stress occurs in S-phase. In this review we describe the signs. signals. and symptoms of replication arrest from an ssDNA perspective. We explore the possible mechanisms for these effects. We also advise the need for caution when detecting and interpreting data related to the accumulation of ssDNA.

Performing a genome-wide screen for changes in such proteins requires developing methods that automate analysis of a large amount of images. the first step of which requires robust segmentation of the cell. We developed a segmentation system. PombeX. that can segment cells from transmitted illumination images with focus gradient and varying contrast. Corrections for focus gradient are applied to the image to aid in accurate detection of cell membrane and cytoplasm pixels. which is used to generate initial contours for cells. Gradient vector flow snake evolution is used to obtain the final cell contours. Finally. a machine learning-based validation of cell contours removes most incorrect or spurious contours. Quantitative evaluations show overall good segmentation performance on a large set of images. regardless of differences in image quality. lighting condition. focus condition and phenotypic profile.

Croatia,Replication fork progression is blocked by a variety impediments including DNA damage. aberrant DNA structures. or nucleotide depletion [1-3]. The response to replication fork stalling varies according the type of replication inhibition. the number of stalled forks and the duration of the treatment [3-7]. Stalled replication forks are at increased risk for DNA damage. which can lead to mutation or cell death [7-13]. The cell relies on the Intra-S phase checkpoint and DNA damage response proteins to preserve fork structure to allow recovery and resumption of the cell cycle [5. 10. 14-19]. Thus. the mechanisms that maintain replication fork structure are crucial for genome maintenance. and form a primary barrier to malignant transformation [20. 21].The drug hydroxyurea (HU) induces a reversible early S-phase arrest by causing deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) depletion [22-24]. HU is a venerable chemotherapeutic. used for its ability to inhibit cell proliferation. but also because it predisposes proliferating cells to genome instability. The loss of replication fork stability and its associated DNA damage following HU treatment is loosely termed “replication fork collapse”. Changes in dNTP pool levels through other mechanisms (eg exogenous thymidine or 5-bromo-2’deoxyuridine treatment) are known to cause point mutations [25-27]. plasmid instability [28] and polyploidization [29]. Further. dNTP pool changes in human cells may cause hypersensitivity to secondary treatment with alkylating agents [30. 31].,True,m5QM6qIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,6,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=sPyPDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA193&dq=info:hLgPWpMRMMoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=mUcc3p03IJ&sig=w2oY82i0kYWQK97FlH-HAoXgfCo,14569164119112398980,/scholar?cites=14569164119112398980,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/the-mechanisms-of-dna-replication/preserving-the-replication-fork-in-response-to-nucleotide-starvation-evading-the-replication-fork-co,0,0,0

Although the discovery and development of MBL inhibitors continue to be an area of active research. an array of potent. small molecule inhibitors is yet to be fully characterized for VIM-2. In the presented research. a compound library screening approach was used to identify and characterize VIM-2 inhibitors from a library of pharmacologically active compounds as well as a focused ‘click’chemistry library.

1051510,Nitric oxide signaling: no longer simply on or off,2006,Stephen PL Cary and Jonathan A Winger and Emily R Derbyshire and Michael A Marletta,31,,4,231-239,Elsevier Current Trends,Nitric oxide (NO) triggers various physiological responses in numerous tissues by binding and activating soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to produce the second messenger cGMP. In vivo. basal NO/cGMP signaling maintains a resting state in target cells (for example. resting tone in smooth muscle). but an acute burst of NO/cGMP signaling triggers rapid responses (such as smooth muscle relaxation). Recent studies have shown that the sGC heterodimer comprises at least four modular domains per subunit. The N-terminal heme domain is a member of the H-NOX family of domains that bind O2 and/or NO and are conserved in prokaryotes and higher eukaryotes. Studies of these domains have uncovered the molecular basis for ligand discrimination by sGC. Other work has identified two temporally distinct states of sGC activation by NO: formation of a stable NO–heme complex results in a low-activity species. and …,True,gKdWPBIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,249,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968000406000570,3423847764060422657,/scholar?cites=3423847764060422657,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48532791/Nitric_oxide_signaling_no_longer_simply_20160902-16440-twc75f.pdf,0,0,0

In the accepted model. NO binds to the sGC heme. activating the enzyme. Here. we report that in the presence of physiological concentrations of ATP and GTP. NO dissociation from the sGC heme is ≈160 times slower than the rate of enzyme deactivation in vitro. Deactivated sGC still has NO bound to the heme. and full activation requires additional NO. We propose an activation model where. in the presence of both ATP and GTP. tonic NO forms a stable heme complex with low sGC activity; acute production of NO transiently and fully activates this NO-bound sGC.,True,gKdWPBIAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,163,https://www.pnas.org/content/102/37/13064.short,12231816535551774741,/scholar?cites=12231816535551774741,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/102/37/13064.full.pdf,0,0,0

Analysis by gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that each of the approximately 25-kDa domains form homodimers. Heterodimers were formed when αcat and βcat were combined. Results from circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that no major structural changes occur upon heterodimer formation.

The guanylate cyclase catalytic module. for which no structure has been determined at present. is a class III nucleotide cyclase domain that is also found in mammalian membrane-bound guanylate and adenylate cyclases. We have determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of a soluble guanylate cyclase from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii at 2.55 Å resolution. and show that it is a dimeric molecule. Comparison of the structure of the guanylate cyclase domain with the known structures of adenylate cyclases confirms the close similarity in architecture between these two enzymes. as expected from their sequence similarity.

1051514,The structure of the leukemia drug imatinib bound to human quinone reductase 2 (NQO2),2009,Jonathan A Winger and Oliver Hantschel and Giulio Superti-Furga and John Kuriyan,9,BMC structural biology,1,1-12,BioMed Central,Imatinib represents the first in a class of drugs targeted against chronic myelogenous leukemia to enter the clinic. showing excellent efficacy and specificity for Abl. Kit. and PDGFR kinases. Recent screens carried out to find off-target proteins that bind to imatinib identified the oxidoreductase NQO2. a flavoprotein that is phosphorylated in a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line. We examined the inhibition of NQO2 activity by the Abl kinase inhibitors imatinib. nilotinib. and dasatinib. and obtained IC50 values of 80 nM. 380 nM. and >100 μM. respectively. Using electronic absorption spectroscopy. we show that imatinib binding results in a perturbation of the protein environment around the flavin prosthetic group in NQO2. We have determined the crystal structure of the complex of imatinib with human NQO2 at 1.75 Å resolution. which reveals that imatinib binds in the enzyme active site. adjacent to the flavin isoalloxazine ring. We find that phosphorylation of NQO2 has little effect on enzyme activity and is therefore likely to regulate other aspects of NQO2 function. The structure of the imatinib-NQO2 complex demonstrates that imatinib inhibits NQO2 activity by competing with substrate for the active site. The overall conformation of imatinib when bound to NQO2 resembles the folded conformation observed in some kinase complexes. Interactions made by imatinib with residues at the rim of the active site provide an explanation for the binding selectivity of NQO2 for imatinib. nilotinib. and dasatinib. These interactions also provide a rationale for the lack of inhibition of the related oxidoreductase NQO1 by these compounds.

They are recruited. via their tandem-SH2 (Src-homology domain 2) domains. to doubly phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on invariant chains of immune antigen receptors. Because of their critical roles in immune signalling. ZAP-70 and Syk are targets for the development of drugs for autoimmune diseases. We show that three thiol-reactive small molecules can prevent the tandem-SH2 domains of ZAP-70 and Syk from binding to phosphorylated ITAMs. We identify a specific cysteine residue in the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket of each protein (Cys39 in ZAP-70.

During acute hypoxic states. the body responds with a compensatory increase in cardiac output that further increases myocardial O2 demand. predisposing the heart to ischemic stress and myocardial dysfunction. Here. we test the utility of a novel engineered protein derived from the heme-based nitric oxide (NO)/oxygen (H-NOX) family of bacterial proteins as an O2 delivery biotherapeutic (Omniox-cardiovascular [OMX-CV]) for the hypoxic myocardium. Because of their unique binding characteristics. H-NOX–based variants effectively deliver O2 to hypoxic tissues. but not those at physiologic O2 tension. Additionally. H-NOX–based variants exhibit tunable binding that is specific for O2 with subphysiologic reactivity towards NO. circumventing a significant toxicity exhibited by hemoglobin (Hb)-based O2 carriers (HBOCs).

Hypoxia favors an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by promoting Treg recruitment and activation and suppressing T cell and NK cell proliferation and effector function and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Therefore. reversing tumor hypoxia could create an immunopermissive microenvironment and improve the efficacy of several immunotherapies. Omniox has developed an oxygen carrier OMX that can specifically deliver oxygen to hypoxic tumor regions without affecting oxygenation of tissues within physiologic oxygen levels.

In this work. streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats fed with a high-fat diet were treated daily with NS oil (NSO) in order to study the effect on the blood glucose. lipid profile. oxidative stress parameters. and the gene expression of some insulin receptor-induced signaling molecules. This treatment was combined also with some drugs (metformin and glimepiride) and the insulin receptor inhibitor I-OMe-AG538. The administration of NSO significantly induced the gene expression of insulin receptor compared to rats that did not receive NSO. Also. it upregulated the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 and phosphoinositide-3 kinase. whereas the expression of ADAM-17 was downregulated. The expression of ADAM-17 is corroborated by the analysis of TIMP-3 content.

The exact mechanism for unexplained male infertility and its correlation to oxidative stress incidence and/or the inflammatory reactions within the male genital tract is still controversially unclear till know. Previous studies have shown the presence of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). a key player in the inflammation process. in the semen of infertile men. However. the mechanism of their effect on human sperm functions is still in need for further under investigations. We expect that. seminal inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α) and its expression regulator. testicular ADAM 17. will be varied. when seminal OS is established. that in turn. will vary cellular integrity and energy status. As conventional treatment of male infertility such as mineral and vitamins supplementation has poor success rates and leaves a lot to be desired. natural antioxidant ingredients are greatly suggested. nowadays. to ameliorate oxidative stress and the inflammatory detrimental effects accompanied to idiopathic male infertility.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) triggers different aspects of disorders such as impaired endogenous lipid metabolism. hypercholesterolemia. oxidative stress. and neurotoxicity. In this study. we examined the mechanism by which NASH induces neurotoxicity and the protective effect of berberine against both NASH and its associated neurotoxicity. NASH induced rats showed significant impairments in lipid metabolism with increased serum triglycerides. cholesterol. and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The NASH induced group also demonstrated a significant oxidative stress which is characterized by increased TBARs level and decreased antioxidant capacity such as GSH and SOD levels. Moreover. the NASH induction was associated with inflammation which was demonstrated by increased TNFα and nitric oxide levels. Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia were observed in the NASH induced group. Also. our results showed a significant increase in the expression of the acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and amyloid beta precursor protein (AβPP).

Acad. J. Biol. Sci,2,147-164,,Three extracts were prepared from the wild plant Fagonia bruguieri: methanolic extract. petroleum ether extract and n-butanolic extract. These extracts were assessed against the penultimate and last instar nymphs of Schistocerca gregaria. After treatment of the penultimate instar nymphs. a dose-dependent trend of mortality could be observed for the methanolic extract. To some extent. a lesser toxic action was exerted on the nymphs by petroleum ether extract or n-butanolic extract. After treatment of the last instar nymphs. an ascending mortality% was estimated as the concentration level of methanolic extract was increased. After treatment of the penultimate instar nymphs. the growth of the same treated nymphs was affected to some extent by the methanolic extract. irrespective of the concentration level. The remarkably influenced nymphal growth was detected only at the highest concentration level of petroleum ether extract and the higher two concentration levels of n-butanolic extract. Also. the profoundly extended developmental duration was caused by petroleum ether extract at the higher three concentration levels. After treatment of the last instar nymphs. all extracts exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth because the nymphs were prohibited to gain somatic weights as their control congeners obtained.

The main body metabolites. carbohydrates. proteins and lipids. were determined during the pupal stage. The lowest dose of Lufenuron or Diofenolan caused a gradual decrease in carbohydrate content. but the highest and medium doses induced a reciprocal V-shaped trend in this metabolite throughout the pupal life. The higher two dose-levels of Diofenolan and all dose-levels of Lufenuron. induced such trend in protein content of pupae. The available results indicated a greater reducing action on protein content of Lufenuron than of Diofenolan. In connection with the lipids. the higher two dose-levels of each acylurea suppressed and then stimulated. the content of this metabolite along the pupal stage.

Five concentration levels (1000. 500. 250. 125 and 62.5 ppm) were given through the fresh plant food to the newly moulted (4th or 5th ) instar or late-aged 5th instar nymphs. All results were obtained 24 h after feeding. The growth of Lufenuron-treated nymphs was profoundly inhibited because their weight gain was drastically  reduced. Such reducing action of Lufenuron  was dose-dependent after treatment of 4th instar nymphs but at the higher two concentration levels after treatment of newly moulted 5th instar nymphs and at the higher three concentration levels after treatment of late-aged  5th instar nymphs.

J. Adv. Res,5,584-596,,The desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Forskal)(Orthoptera: Acrididae) is a destructive pest to many crops in several African and Asian countries due to its voracious feeding and invasions in swarms. Most recent large-scale outbreaks of it occurred in 1986-1989 and in 2003-2005. mostly on the African continent (Latchininsky. 2013). In 2003-2005. to curtail the outbreak of this locust. 13 million ha were treated with broad-spectrum insecticides in 26 countries on three continents. Such transcontinental operations. together with food aid for affected populations. cost over half a billion USD to the world community. not to mention human and environmental health costs (Belaynech. 2005).Current locust control operations are mainly based on organophosphorus pesticides as a result of the banning of organochlorines (Lecoq. 2001). The widespread use of such synthetic pesticides has considerable drawbacks. such as the development of insect resistance to insecticides. increased costs. handling hazards. concerns about insecticide residues. and great threats to both human and environmental health (Garriga and Caballero. 2011). Therefore. many institutions have intensified their efforts in the search for integrated locust control measures.

Parkinson’s and diabetes. In each system. self-assembly into oligomers is observed and can also result in poration of artificial membranes. Structural requirements for poration and the relationship of structure to cytotoxicity is unaddressed. Here we focus on islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) mediated loss-of-insulin secreting cells in patients with diabetes. Newly developed methods enable structure-function enquiry to focus on intracellular oligomers composed of hundreds of IAPP. The key insights are that porating oligomers are internally dynamic. grow in discrete steps and are not canonical amyloid. Moreover. two classes of poration occur; an IAPP-specific ligand establishes that only one is cytotoxic. Toxic rescue occurs by stabilising non-toxic poration without displacing IAPP from mitochondria.

Recent studies have decisively demonstrated that the prefibrillar soluble oligomers are the neurotoxic culprits and are associated with the pathology of AD. Nascent Aβ42 is predominantly disordered but samples α-helical conformations covering residues 15–24 and 29–35 in the presence of micelles and structure-inducing solvents. In this report. a focused library of oligopyridylamide based α-helical mimetics was designed to target the central α-helix subdomain of Aβ (Aβ13–26). A tripyridylamide.

However. clinical progress is impeded by the limited structural information about the neurotoxic oligomers. To address this issue. we have adopted a synthetic approach. where a library of oligopyridylamide-based small molecules was tested against various microscopic events implicated in the self-assembly of Aβ. Two oligopyridylamides bind to different domains of Aβ and affect distinct microscopic events in Aβ self-assembly.

Upon contact with lipid bilayers. it is stabilized into a heterogeneous ensemble of structural states. These processes are associated with gains of function. including catalysis of β sheet-rich amyloid formation. cell membrane penetration. loss of membrane integrity. and cytotoxicity.

Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) catalyze the reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to the methionine residue. To assess the role of this enzyme. we generated transgenic rice using a pepper CaMSRB2 gene under the control of the rice Rab21 (responsive to ABA protein 21) promoter with/without a selection marker. the bar gene.  Results A drought resistance test on transgenic plants showed that CaMSRB2 confers drought tolerance to rice. as evidenced by less oxidative stress symptoms and a strengthened PSII quantum yield under stress conditions. and increased survival rate and chlorophyll index after the re-watering. The results from immunoblotting using a methionine sulfoxide antibody and nano-LC-MS/MS spectrometry suggest that porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). which is involved in chlorophyll synthesis. is a putative target of CaMSRB2. The oxidized methionine content of PBGD expressed in E. coli increased in the presence of H2O2. and the Met-95 and Met-227 residues of PBGD were reduced by CaMSRB2 in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). An expression profiling analysis of the overexpression lines also suggested that photosystems are less severely affected by drought stress.

Beta-cyfluthrin is a type II pyrethroid pesticide and is widely used against crop and house hold pests. The present study has been designed to assess histochemical alterations following beta-cyfluthrin intoxication in the liver of the female albino rat (Rattus norvegicus). Beta-cyfluthrin was orally administrated. 35.48 mg/kg b. wt. for acute (1 day) and 5.06. 2.53 and 1.68 mg/kg b. wt. for sub-acute (7. 14 and 21 days) treatments respectively. Beta-cyfluthrin caused marked hepatotoxicity in the form of altered hepatosomatic index viz. liver weight. body weight and liver weight-body weight ratio and histochemical localization of DNA and proteins in the liver of albino rat. On the basis of histochemical study. it could be revealed that beta-cyfluthrin causes a reduction in hepatic proteins and an enhancement in the hepatic DNA. The centrilobular zone was the zone of maximum alteration followed by the midzone and periportal zone of the hepatic lobule. Decreased protein content is a consequence of lysis of structural proteins and the need to support increased cell proliferation under stress of beta-cyfluthrin. whereas increased DNA is a consequence of increased mitogenic activity resulting in excessive cell proliferation.. It is proposed that xenobiotic metabolising enzymes. which are most concentrated in the centrilobular zone. cause the formation of metabolites of beta-cyfluthrin. which are toxic to the liver. Lower oxygen levels in the centrilobular zone. compared to other parts of the liver lobule. may have also contributed to the observed histochemical changes …,True,7x5QDfAAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,30,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brijender_Bhushan/publication/315692752_Beta-cyfluthrin_induced_histochemical_changes_in_the_liver_of_albino_arts/data/58dbe4edaca2725c472712bc/204-400-1-SM.pdf,766189416861569982,/scholar?cites=766189416861569982,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brijender_Bhushan/publication/315692752_Beta-cyfluthrin_induced_histochemical_changes_in_the_liver_of_albino_arts/data/58dbe4edaca2725c472712bc/204-400-1-SM.pdf,0,0,0

The niosomes were characterized by in vitro studies like entrapment efficiency. particle size. drug release profile. zeta potential. stability studies. etc.. and in vivo bioavailability study. The anti-proliferative efficacy of formulation was evaluated against MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines which exhibited an excellent response in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis assay demonstrated that anti-proliferative activity occurred due to an apoptotic pathway. which revealed the potential in formulation development of lycopene against cancer. The overall results indicate that the methodology for the formulation of lycopene niosomes is promising and very effective. It has the potential for wider applications along with the fact that. the method used for active drug loading into niosomes strongly influences the pharmaceutical performance of the formulation.,True,7x5QDfAAAAAJ:Br1UauaknNIC,25,https://www.academia.edu/download/52518240/novel-encapsulation-of-lycopene-in-niosomes-and-assessment-of-its-anticancer-activity-jbb-1000300.pdf,13285138814707714000,/scholar?cites=13285138814707714000,,https://www.academia.edu/download/52518240/novel-encapsulation-of-lycopene-in-niosomes-and-assessment-of-its-anticancer-activity-jbb-1000300.pdf,0,0,0

Brevican. an abundant extracellular matrix component in the adult brain. plays a critical role in the process of glioma. The mechanisms for the highly invasive behavior of gliomas are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to examine whether brevican is a predictor of glioma and its roles in glioma cell motility. In this study. immunohistochemistry staining for brevican expression was performed in malignant gliomas and benign controls. We also explored the effects of brevican on cell adhesion and migration in brevican-overexpressed cells. Knockdown of brevican expression was achieved by stable transfection of U251 cells transduced with a construct encoding a short hairpin DNA directed against the brevican gene. which correspondingly. down-regulated the proliferation. invasion and spread of brevican-expressing cells. Moreover. the role of brevican in the growth and progression of glioma was demonstrated by in vivo studies. Our results provide evidence for the molecular and cellular mechanisms that may underlie the motility-promoting role of brevican in the progression of glioma. The role of brevican as a target for immunotherapy might be taken into consideration in future studies. This study suggests that expression of brevican is associated with glioma cell adhesion. motility and tumor growth. and also is related to glioma cell differentiation. therefore it may be a marker for malignance degree of glioma,True,DCazrWwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,31,https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-12-607,15435504776399184614,/scholar?cites=15435504776399184614,,https://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2407-12-607,0,0,0

In 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Brd2 normally co-represses PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) and inhibits adipogenesis. Here. we show that Brd2 over-expression in preadipocytes inhibits their differentiation into adipocytes. while Brd2 knockdown promotes adipogenic differentiation in vitro and forces cells to undergo adipogenesis independent of the MDI (methyisobutylxanthane. dexamethasone and insulin) induction. In this study. the two key transcription factors for adipogenesis. PPARγ and C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α) were persistently expressed during the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes in Brd2 knockdown 3T3-L1 cells. but their expression was inhibited in cells in which Brd2 was overexpressed. To investigate the role of Brd2 in signal transduction we examined the expression of several signaling molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation by immunoblotting assay. Down-regulation of Brd2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells led to a decrease in extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) activity and. conversely. the up-regulation of Brd2 leads to increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Nevertheless. changes in Brd2 expression do not affect the activities of JNK and p38 MAPK. In addition. the phosphorylation of Rafs is not affected by changes in Brd2 expression in 3T3-L1 cells.

Recombinant human microplasminogen (rhμPlg) is a derivative of plasmin that solely consists of the catalytic domain of human plasmin and lacks the five kringle domains found in the native protein. Developing an industrial production method that provides high yields of this protein with high purity. quality. and potency is critical for preclinical research. The human microplasminogen gene was cloned into the pPIC9K vector. and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into Pichia pastoris strain GS115. The concentration of plasmin reached 510.1 mg/L of culture medium. Under fermentation conditions. the yield of rhμPlg was 1.0 g/L.

Rac1 is expressed in smooth muscle cells. a critical cell type involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension. The molecular mechanisms that underlie hypoxia-associated pulmonary hypertension are not well-defined.   Methodology/Principal Findings Bcr and abr null mutant mice were compared to wild type controls for the development of pulmonary hypertension after exposure to hypoxia. Also. pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from those mice were cultured in hypoxia and examined for proliferation. p38 activation and IL-6 production. Mice lacking Bcr or Abr exposed to hypoxia developed increased right ventricular pressure. hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Perivascular leukocyte infiltration in the lungs was increased. and under hypoxia bcr−/− and abr−/− macrophages generated more reactive oxygen species. Consistent with a contribution of inflammation and oxidative stress in pulmonary hypertension-associated vascular damage. Bcr and Abr-deficient animals showed elevated endothelial leakage after hypoxia exposure. Hypoxia-treated pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from Bcr- or Abr-deficient mice also proliferated faster than those of wild type mice. Moreover. activated Rac1. phosphorylated p38 and interleukin 6 were increased in these cells in the absence of Bcr or Abr.

Here. we probed the role of glutathione transferase (GST) P1-1. an antiapoptotic protein often overexpressed in drug-resistant tumors. as a cis-DDP–binding protein. Our results show that cis-DDP is not a substrate for the glutathione (GSH) transferase activity of GST P1-1. Instead. GST P1-1 sequesters and inactivates cisplatin with the aid of 2 solvent-accessible cysteines. resulting in protein subunits cross-linking. while maintaining its GSH-conjugation activity. Furthermore. it is well known that GST P1-1 binding to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibits JNK phosphorylation. which is required for downstream apoptosis signaling. Thus. in turn.

NBDs have been shown to impair the growth and survival of a broad-spectrum of tumor types. in vitro and in vivo. Herein. we evaluated the effects of the new compound MC3181 on U-2OS osteosarcoma cells and investigated the impact of both NBDHEX and MC3181 on autophagy. Cell viability was evaluated by sulforhodamine B assay. The dissociation of the TRAF2-GSTP1-1 complex was detected by proximity ligation assay. while the phospho-activation of JNK was assessed by western blotting. The effects of NBDs on autophagy were evaluated by GFP-LC3 puncta formation. western blotting for LC3-II and p62. and LC3 turnover assay in the presence of bafilomycin A1. The role of JNK in the reduction of autophagic flux caused by NBDs was investigated using JNK1 shRNA-transfected cells. Fluorogenic caspase activity assay and flow cytometric analysis of DNA content were used to determine the cytotoxic effects of NBDs on JNK1-silenced cells. Similar to NBDHEX. MC3181 reduced viability and activated TRAF2/JNK signaling in U-2OS cells. Moreover.

The primary met product is a 150 kDa precursor that is glycosylated to generate a 170 kDa (p170met) proreceptor protein. The mature form of the receptor is generated by cleavage of p170met to yield a disulfide-linked 140 kDa beta-subunit (p140met) and a 45 kDa alpha-subunit (p45met). Both products are glycosylated. Under non-reducing conditions both p170met and the alpha. beta-disulfide-linked protein are detected as a 185 kDa product (p185met). but only alpha-beta heterodimeric p185met is cross-linked and rendered resistant to disulfide reduction with membrane-impermeable 6.4 A linker length cross-linking reagents. These data indicate that the p170 precursor is not on the cell surface.

Lubben and J.A. Traugh (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258. 13992-13997). In these studies. we have shown that PAK II can be activated in a Ca2+-independent manner with phospholipids/diolein using histone 1. eukaryotic initiation factor 2. and 40 S ribosomal subunits as substrates. The addition of Ca2+ results in a diminution of PAK II activity. The Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) is present in reticulocytes and is separated from PAK II during purification by chromatography on ADP-agarose.

1051733,A quasi-exclusive European ancestry in the Senepol tropical cattle breed highlights the importance of the slick locus in tropical adaptation,2012,Laurence Flori and Mary Isabel Gonzatti and Sophie Thevenon and Isabelle Chantal and Joar Pinto and David Berthier and Pedro M Aso and Mathieu Gautier,7,PloS one,5,e36133,Public Library of Science,Background The Senepol cattle breed (SEN) was created in the early XXth century from a presumed cross between a European (EUT) breed (Red Poll) and a West African taurine (AFT) breed (N’Dama). Well adapted to tropical conditions. it is also believed trypanotolerant according to its putative AFT ancestry. However. such origins needed to be verified to define relevant husbandry practices and the genetic background underlying such adaptation needed to be characterized.   Methodology/Principal Findings We genotyped 153 SEN individuals on 47.365 SNPs and combined the resulting data with those available on 18 other populations representative of EUT. AFT and Zebu (ZEB) cattle. We found on average 89% EUT. 10.4% ZEB and 0.6% AFT ancestries in the SEN genome. We further looked for footprints of recent selection using standard tests based on the extent of haplotype homozygosity. We underlined i) three footprints on chromosome (BTA) 01. two of which are within or close to the polled locus underlying the absence of horns and ii) one footprint on BTA20 within the slick hair coat locus. involved in thermotolerance. Annotation of these regions allowed us to propose three candidate genes to explain the observed signals (TIAM1. GRIK1 and RAI14).   Conclusions/Significance Our results do not support the accepted concept about the AFT origin of SEN breed. Initial AFT ancestry (if any) might have been counter-selected in early generations due to breeding objectives oriented in particular toward meat production and hornless phenotype. Therefore. SEN animals are likely susceptible to African trypanosomes which questions the …,True,Y-VM8yAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,51,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036133,1196862130770698179,/scholar?cites=1196862130770698179,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036133,0,0,0

The causative agents are various species of protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. among which T. congolense and T. evansi are the major pathogenic species. The extracellular position of trypanosomes obliges us to consider both the parasite and its excreted/secreted factors in the course of the physiopathologic process. The advent of proteomics led us to propose a comparative approach of the proteome (ie. the whole parasite content) and the secretome (ie. naturally excreted/secreted molecules) of T. congolense and T. evansi with particular attention to common and specific molecules between strains of differing virulence and pathogenicity.

It is caused by several species of the genus Trypanosoma that are transmitted cyclically by tsetse flies. mechanically by other haematophagous flies. or sexually. Trypanosoma congolense (subgenus Nannomonas) and T. vivax (subgenus Dutonella) are genetically and morphologically distinct from T. brucei. T. equiperdum and T. evansi (subgenus Trypanozoon). It remains controversial whether the three latter taxa should be considered distinct species. Recent outbreaks of surra and dourine in Europe illustrate the risk and consequences of importation of equine trypanosomosis with infected animals into non-endemic countries. Knowledge on the epidemiological situation is fragmentary since many endemic countries do not report the diseases to the World Organisation for Animal Health. OIE. Other major obstacles to the control of equine trypanosomosis are the lack of vaccines. the inability of drugs to cure the neurological stage of the disease. the inconsistent case definition and the limitations of current diagnostics. Especially in view of the ever-increasing movement of horses around the globe. there is not only the obvious need for reliable curative and prophylactic drugs but also for accurate diagnostic tests and algorithms.

1051749,The human met oncogene is a member of the tyrosine kinase family.,1986,M Gonzatti-Haces and M Park and M Dean and DG Blair and Vande Woude GF,17,,,221-232,,Prolonged exposure of a nontumorigenic human osteogenic sarcoma cell line (HOS) with the direct acting carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) gave rise to morphologically transformed cells which were tumorigenic in nude mice and termed MNNG-HOS. We have shown that DNA from MNNG-HOS cells will transform NIH/3T3 cells and have isolated greater than 35 kb of human DNA containing an oncogene. termed met. The activated met oncogene expresses a novel 5.0 kb RNA transcript which is a hybrid RNA derived from a DNA rearrangement involving two distinct genetic loci termed met and tpr (translocated promoter region). The met proto-oncogene has been localized to 7q21-q31 by in situ hybridization. This locus expresses a 9.0 kb RNA in fibroblast and epithelial cell lines. but is not commonly expressed in cell lines derived from the hematopoietic cell lineage. In contrast. the tpr locus is on chromosome 1. and expresses a 10.0 kb RNA in all human cell lines tested. The novel 5.0 kb met oncogene RNA is 3'co-terminal with the 9.0 kb met proto-oncogene RNA. while the 5'portion of this RNA uses at least two exons derived from the 10.0 kb tpr RNA. These exons are small and are presumably in the promoter region of both tpr and tpr-met transcripts. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 3'end of met shows that it is a member of the tyrosine kinase family of genes. Peptide antibody to the C-terminal coding region of met immunoprecipitates a 65 kilodalton (kd) polypeptide (p65) in both MNNG-HOS cells and met transformed NIH/3T3 cells.

In both stages three is a cAMP receptor protein (CARPT). with unique properties that differentiate it from the regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RI and RII). The CARPT from T. cruzi epimastigotes was purified using ion-exchange chromatography. affinity chromatography and gel filtration. After the final step of purification. two protein bands were obtained. p89 and p70. corresponding to the intact CARPT and its proteolytic product. These two CARPT polypeptides were utilized to prepare polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Previous results from our laboratory showed that CARPT cross-reacts with polyclonal antibodies prepared against the regulatory subunit (RII) of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). As expected from these results. the anti-CARPT antibody recognized purified RII protein in an ELISA assay. The anti-CARPT antibodies were used for immunoblot analyses of epimastigote lysates. The two bands corresponding to the CARPT (p89 and p70). as well as a p40 band. were recognized. Immunoscreening of a T. cruzi lambda ZAP cDNA library with these anti-CARPT polyclonal antibodies yielded one positive clone (pBSCARPT) which contained a 540 bp insert.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). deferoxamine (DFO) and selenium in protection against renal injury in ADR nephropathy.Methods: The study included 53 Sprague Dawley male rats. Nephrotic syndrome was induced by injection of ADR 5 mg/kg intravenously (n= 46). Control rats (n= 7) were injected with an equal volume of isotonic saline. After ADR administration. they were divided into a group given only ADR (n= 17) and 3 antioxidant treatment groups:(i) NAC (n= 10).(ii) DFO (n= 10) and (iii) selenium (n= 9).

SM causes debilitating effects that can leave an exposed individual incapacitated for days to months; therefore delayed SM toxicity is of much greater importance than its ability to cause lethality. Although not fully understood. acute toxicity of SM is related to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. oxidative stress. DNA damage. poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation and energy depletion within the affected cell. Therefore several antioxidants and PARP inhibitors show beneficial effects against acute SM toxicity. The delayed toxicity of SM however. currently has no clear mechanistic explanation. One third of the 100.000 Iranian casualties are still suffering from the detrimental effects of SM in spite of the extensive treatment. We. therefore. made an attempt whether epigenetic aberrations may contribute to pathogenesis of mustard poisoning. Preliminary evidence reveals that mechlorethamine (a nitrogen mustard derivative) exposure may not only cause oxidative stress. DNA damage. but epigenetic perturbations as well. Epigenetic refers to the study of changes that influence the phenotype without causing alteration of the genotype. It involves changes in the properties of a cell that are inherited but do not involve a change in DNA sequence.

Its agricultural usage may also cause environmental contamination leading to some harmful effects on human health. In addition. aldicarb has a potential risk that terrorist groups might use delibaretely against public as a chemical weapon due to its commercial availability on the markets and handling without any restriction. Therefore. its removal or detoxification has been increasingly gaining a great importance.Methods: In this study. we investigated the degradation effect of soil bacteria on aldicarb which contaminates the soil following usage for a long time by using some biochemical methods including chromatograhic and spectrophotometric techniques.Results: The results of various biochemical methods showed that some of the soil bacteria had the ability to utilize aldicarb through hydrolysis and degradation by bacterial enzyme-esterase. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was also determined as having the most biodegradative effect on aldicarb.Conclusion: Based on these data. we may expect that some soil bacteria in the form of biotechnological materials can be used in order to decontaminate/detoxify aldicarb or chemical agents similar to such pesticides.,True,nksstikAAAAJ:NhqRSupF_l8C,15,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmet_Aydin5/publication/237474205_Bacterial_Biodegradation_of_Aldicarb_and_Determination_of_Bacterium_Which_Has_The_Most_Biodegradative_Effect_Aldikarbin_Bakteriyel_Parcalanmasi_ve_Parcalayici_Etkisi_En_Fazla_Olan_Bakterinin_Saptanmas/links/548c21f60cf2d1800d7dbc63.pdf,12517139954560327106,/scholar?cites=12517139954560327106,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmet_Aydin5/publication/237474205_Bacterial_Biodegradation_of_Aldicarb_and_Determination_of_Bacterium_Which_Has_The_Most_Biodegradative_Effect_Aldikarbin_Bakteriyel_Parcalanmasi_ve_Parcalayici_Etkisi_En_Fazla_Olan_Bakterinin_Saptanmas/links/548c21f60cf2d1800d7dbc63.pdf,0,0,0
