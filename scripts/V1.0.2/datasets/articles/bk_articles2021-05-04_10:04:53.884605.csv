1286357,Shared-nearest-neighbor-based clustering by fast search and find of density peaks,2018,Rui Liu and Hong Wang and Xiaomei Yu,450,Information Sciences,,200-226,Elsevier,Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks (DPC) is a new clustering method that was reported in Science in June 2014. This clustering algorithm is based on the assumption that cluster centers have high local densities and are generally far from each other. With a decision graph. cluster centers can be easily located. However. this approach suffers from certain disadvantages. First. the definition of the local density and distance measurement is too simple; therefore. the DPC algorithm might perform poorly on complex datasets that are of multiple scales. cross-winding. of various densities. or of high dimensionality. Second. the one-step allocation strategy is not robust and has poor fault tolerance. Thus. if a point is assigned incorrectly. then the subsequent allocation will further amplify the error. resulting in more errors. which will have a severe negative impact on the clustering results. Third. the cutoff distance …,True,FMbmNJQAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,123,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025518302093,7745308741099971675,/scholar?cites=7745308741099971675,,,https://resume.liurui.info/asset/Shared-Nearest-Neighbor-Based%20Clustering%20by%20Fast%20Search%20and%20Find%20of%20Density%20Peaks.pdf,0,0,0

The major existed content-aware methods perform well. However. there are two problems should be improved: the slight distortion appeared at the object edges and the structure distortion in the nonsalient area. According to psychological theories. people evaluate image quality based on multi-level judgments and comparison between different areas. both image content and image structure. The paper proposes a new standard: the structure preserving in non-salient area. After observation and image analysis. blur (slight blur) is generally existed at the edge of objects.

1286359,Real-Time Streaming Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Graphs,2020,Siddharth Bhatia and Rui Liu and Bryan Hooi and Minji Yoon and Kijung Shin and Christos Faloutsos,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.08452,,,,Given a stream of graph edges from a dynamic graph. how can we assign anomaly scores to edges in an online manner. for the purpose of detecting unusual behavior. using constant time and memory? Existing approaches aim to detect individually surprising edges. In this work. we propose MIDAS. which focuses on detecting microcluster anomalies. or suddenly arriving groups of suspiciously similar edges. such as lockstep behavior. including denial of service attacks in network traffic data. We further propose MIDAS-F. to solve the problem by which anomalies are incorporated into the algorithm's internal states. creating a'poisoning'effect which can allow future anomalies to slip through undetected. MIDAS-F introduces two modifications: 1) We modify the anomaly scoring function. aiming to reduce the'poisoning'effect of newly arriving edges; 2) We introduce a conditional merge step. which updates the algorithm's data structures after each time tick. but only if the anomaly score is below a threshold value. also to reduce thepoisoning'effect. Experiments show that MIDAS-F has significantly higher accuracy than MIDAS. MIDAS has the following properties:(a) it detects microcluster anomalies while providing theoretical guarantees about its false positive probability;(b) it is online. thus processing each edge in constant time and constant memory. and also processes the data 130 to 929 times faster than state-of-the-art approaches;(c) it provides 41% to 55% higher accuracy (in terms of ROC-AUC) than state-of-the-art approaches.,True,FMbmNJQAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,2,https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08452,17219820478536116274,/scholar?cites=17219820478536116274,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08452,0,0,0
1286360,Isconna: Streaming Anomaly Detection with Frequency and Patterns,2021,Rui Liu and Siddharth Bhatia and Bryan Hooi,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.01632,,,,An edge stream is a common form of presentation of dynamic networks. It can evolve with time. with new types of nodes or edges being continuously added. Existing methods for anomaly detection rely on edge occurrence counts or compare pattern snippets found in historical records. In this work. we propose Isconna. which focuses on both the frequency and the pattern of edge records. The burst detection component targets anomalies between individual timestamps. while the pattern detection component highlights anomalies across segments of timestamps. These two components together produce three intermediate scores. which are aggregated into the final anomaly score. Isconna does not actively explore or maintain pattern snippets; it instead measures the consecutive presence and absence of edge records. Isconna is an online algorithm. it does not keep the original information of edge records; only statistical values are maintained in a few count-min sketches (CMS). Isconna's space complexity  is determined by two user-specific parameters. the size of CMSs. In worst case. Isconna's time complexity can be up to . but it can be amortized in practice. Experiments show that Isconna outperforms five state-of-the-art frequency-and/or pattern-based baselines on six real-world datasets with up to 20 million edge records.,True,FMbmNJQAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01632,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01632,0,0,0

This cost is in great part due to the excessive number of trained parameters. which are well-known to be redundant and compressible for the execution phase. This paper proposes a novel transformation which changes the topology of the DL architecture such that it reaches an optimal cross-layer connectivity. This transformation leverages our important observation that for a set level of accuracy. convergence is fastest when network topology reaches the boundary of a Small-World Network. Small-world graphs are known to possess a specific connectivity structure that enables enhanced signal propagation among nodes. Our small-world models. called SWNets. provide several intriguing benefits: they facilitate data (gradient) flow within the network. enable feature-map reuse by adding long-range connections and accommodate various network architectures/datasets. Compared to densely connected networks (eg. DenseNets). SWNets require a substantially fewer number of training parameters while maintaining a similar level of classification accuracy.

1286380,A Public Transport Bus Assignment Problem: Parallel Metaheuristics Assessment,2015,David Semedo,,,,,,Combinatorial Optimization Problems occur in a wide variety of contexts and generally are NP-hard problems. At a corporate level solving this problems is of great importance since they contribute to the optimization of operational costs. In this thesis we propose to solve the Public Transport Bus Assignment problem considering an heterogeneous fleet and line exchanges. a variant of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem in which additional constraints are enforced to model a real life scenario. The number of constraints involved and the large number of variables makes impracticable solving to optimality using complete search techniques. Therefore. we explore metaheuristics. that sacrifice optimality to produce solutions in feasible time. More concretely. we focus on the development of algorithms based on a sophisticated metaheuristic. Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO). which is based on a stochastic learning mechanism. For complex problems with a considerable number of constraints. sophisticated metaheuristics may fail to produce quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Thus. we developed parallel shared-memory (SM) synchronous ACO algorithms. however. synchronism originates the straggler problem. Therefore. we proposed three SM asynchronous algorithms that break the original algorithm semantics and differ on the degree of concurrency allowed while manipulating the learned information. Our results show that our sequential ACO algorithms produced better solutions than a Restarts metaheuristic. the ACO algorithms were able to learn and better solutions were achieved by increasing the amount of cooperation …,True,yvWC4jsAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/16173,16031462335827166243,/scholar?cites=16031462335827166243,,,https://run.unl.pt/bitstream/10362/16173/1/Semedo_2015.pdf,0,0,0

1286382,Bridging Vision and Language over Time with Neural Cross-modal Embeddings,2020,David Fernandes Semedo,,,,,,Giving computers the ability to understand multimedia content is one of the goals of Artificial Intelligence systems. While humans excel at this task. it remains a challenge. requiring bridging vision and language. which inherently have heterogeneous computational representations. Cross-modal embeddings are used to tackle this challenge. by learning a common space that uni es these representations. However. to grasp the semantics of an image. one must look beyond the pixels and consider its semantic and temporal context. with the latter being de ned by images’ textual descriptions and time dimension. respectively. As such. external causes (e.g. emerging events) change the way humans interpret and describe the same visual element over time. leading to the evolution of visual-textual correlations. In this thesis we investigate models that capture patterns of visual and textual interactions over time. by incorporating time in cross-modal embeddings: 1) in a relative manner. where by using pairwise temporal correlations to aid data structuring. we obtained a model that provides better visual-textual correspondences on dynamic corpora. and 2) in a diachronic manner. where the temporal dimension is fully preserved. thus capturing visual-textual correlations evolution under a principled approach that jointly models vision+language+time. Rich insights stemming from data evolution were extracted from a 20 years large-scale dataset. Additionally. towards improving the e ectiveness of these embedding learning models. we proposed a novel loss function that increases the expressiveness of the standard triplet-loss. by making it adaptive to the data …,True,yvWC4jsAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,1,https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/101656,16089259776535173620,/scholar?cites=16089259776535173620,,,https://run.unl.pt/bitstream/10362/101656/1/Semedo_2020.pdf,0,0,0

Existing self-training based UDA approaches assign pseudo labels for target data and treat them as ground truth labels to fully leverage unlabeled target data for model adaptation.

To tackle this issue. we advance a MetaCorrection framework. where a Domain-aware Meta-learning strategy is devised to benefit Loss Correction (DMLC) for UDA semantic segmentation. In particular. we model the noise distribution of pseudo labels in target domain by introducing a noise transition matrix (NTM) and construct meta data set with domain-invariant source data to guide the estimation of NTM. Through the risk minimization on the meta data set. the optimized NTM thus can correct the noisy issues in pseudo labels and enhance the generalization ability of the model on the target data.

However. simply combing these features may cause high dimensionality and lead to noises. Feature selection and fusion are common choices for multiple feature representation. In this paper. we propose a multi-view feature selection and fusion method which chooses and fuses discriminative features from multiple feature sets. For discriminative feature selection. we learn the selection matrix W by the minimization of the trace ratio objective function with ℓ 2.1  norm regularization. For multiple feature fusion. we incorporate local structures of each view in the Laplacian matrix.

1286402,Post-training 4-bit quantization of convolution networks for rapid-deployment,2018,Ron Banner and Yury Nahshan and Elad Hoffer and Daniel Soudry,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.05723,,,,Convolutional neural networks require significant memory bandwidth and storage for intermediate computations. apart from substantial computing resources. Neural network quantization has significant benefits in reducing the amount of intermediate results. but it often requires the full datasets and time-consuming fine tuning to recover the accuracy lost after quantization. This paper introduces the first practical 4-bit post training quantization approach: it does not involve training the quantized model (fine-tuning). nor it requires the availability of the full dataset. We target the quantization of both activations and weights and suggest three complementary methods for minimizing quantization error at the tensor level. two of whom obtain a closed-form analytical solution. Combining these methods. our approach achieves accuracy that is just a few percents less the state-of-the-art baseline across a wide range of convolutional models.

Current post-training quantization methods fall short in terms of accuracy for INT4 (or lower) but provide reasonable accuracy for INT8 (or above).

Additionally. we show that the structure is flat and separable for mild quantization. enabling straightforward post-training quantization methods to achieve good results. We show that with more aggressive quantization. the loss landscape becomes highly non-separable with steep curvature. making the selection of quantization parameters more challenging.

This makes the trained model highly dependent on the precise way quantization is performed. Since low-precision accelerators differ in their quantization policies and their supported mix of data-types. a model trained for one accelerator may not be suitable for another. To address this issue. we propose KURE. a method that provides intrinsic robustness to the model against a broad range of quantization implementations.

However. this training is not always possible in real-world scenarios. as it requires the full dataset. Lately. post-training quantization methods have gained considerable attention. as they are simple to use and require only a small. unlabeled calibration set. Yet. they usually incur significant accuracy degradation when quantized below 8-bits. This paper seeks to address this problem by introducing two pipelines. advanced and light. where the former involves:(i) minimizing the quantization errors of each layer by optimizing its parameters over the calibration set;(ii) using integer programming to optimally allocate the desired bit-width for each layer while constraining accuracy degradation or model compression; and (iii) tuning the mixed-precision model statistics to correct biases introduced during quantization. While the light pipeline which invokes only (ii) and (iii) obtains surprisingly accurate results; the advanced pipeline yields state-of-the-art accuracy-compression ratios for both vision and text models. For instance. on ResNet50. we obtain less than 1% accuracy degradation while compressing the model to 13% of its original size.

Key substrates of ADAM17 are the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and TNF-α. The extracellular region of ADAM17 consists of a prodomain. a catalytic domain. a disintegrin domain. and a membrane-proximal domain as well as a small stalk region. This study demonstrates that this juxtamembrane segment is highly conserved. α-helical. and involved in IL-6R binding. This process is regulated by the structure of the preceding membrane-proximal domain. which acts as molecular switch of ADAM17 activity operated by a protein-disulfide isomerase.

They are increasingly being used in medical imaging to provide clinically plausible explanations for the decisions the neural network makes. However. the utility and robustness of these visualization maps has not yet been rigorously examined in the context of medical imaging. We posit that trustworthiness in this context requires 1) localization utility. 2) sensitivity to model weight randomization. 3) repeatability. and 4) reproducibility. Using the localization information available in two large public radiology datasets. we quantify the performance of eight commonly used saliency map approaches for the above criteria using area under the precision-recall curves (AUPRC) and structural similarity index (SSIM). comparing their performance to various baseline measures. Using our framework to quantify the trustworthiness of saliency maps. we show that all eight saliency map techniques fail at least one of the criteria and are. in most cases. less trustworthy when compared to the baselines. We suggest that their usage in the high-risk domain of medical imaging warrants additional scrutiny and recommend that detection or segmentation models be used if localization is the desired output of the network.

We first train the encoding arm as a localization network to predict the center of the target. before extending it into a U-net architecture for segmentation. We apply our proposed method to the problem of segmenting the optic disc from fundus photographs. Our work shows that the features learned by encoding arm can be transferred to the segmentation network to reduce the annotation burden.

1286454,Multimodal dynamic MRI for structural and functional assessment of cancer,2017,Endre Grøvik,,,,,,Cancer is the general term for more than 100 different diseases involving abnormal cell growth that are classified by the type of cell initially affected. The aggressiveness. treatment response. and prognosis vary greatly among this collection of diseases. where alterations in oncogenes. tumour suppressor genes and/or stability genes are causes of disease initiation and progression. In 2012. an estimated 14.1 million people were diagnosed with cancer worldwide. and 8.2 million cancer deaths occurred (1). The three most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung. breast. and colorectal. with breast-and colorectal cancer ranked as the 5th and 4th leading causes of death by cancer. respectively (1). Even though the biology of different cancer phenotypes is complex and highly heterogeneous. a common set of hallmarks of cancer has been identified (2. 3). These hallmarks define a set of capabilities that cancer cells must acquire in order to develop malignant potential. One of these is the ability to induce angiogenesis. defined as the physiological process through which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing vessels. This is essential since the proliferation. as well as metastatic spread. of cancer cells depends on a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients. in addition to the removal of waste products. Angiogenesis is a normal and vital process in normal tissue; however. in cancer tissue this process is no longer governed by normal control mechanisms. leading to tumour vessels that are structurally chaotic and highly permeable (4).

Recently. a variety of deep learning methods have been applied to segmentation tasks in medical images. with promising results for computer-aided diagnosis. For MR images. effectively integrating different pulse sequences is important to optimize performance. However. the best way to integrate different pulse sequences remains unclear. In this study. we evaluate multiple architectural features and characterize their effects in the task of metastasis segmentation. Specifically. we consider (1) different pulse sequence integration schemas.(2) different modes of weight sharing for parallel network branches. and (3) a new approach for enabling robustness to missing pulse sequences. We find that levels of integration and modes of weight sharing that favor low variance work best in our regime of small data (n= 100). By adding an input-level dropout layer. we could preserve the overall performance of these networks while allowing for inference on inputs with missing pulse sequence. We illustrate not only the generalizability of the network but also the utility of this robustness when applying the trained model to data from a different center. which does not use the same pulse sequences. Finally. we apply network visualization methods to better understand which input features are most important for network performance.

However. the need for accurately labeled input data. often requiring time-and labor-intensive annotation by experts. is a major limitation to the use of deep learning. One solution to this challenge is to allow for use of coarse or noisy labels. which could permit more efficient and scalable labeling of images. In this work. we develop a lopsided loss function based on entropy regularization that assumes the existence of a nontrivial false negative rate in the target annotations. Starting with a carefully annotated brain metastasis lesion dataset. we simulate data with false negatives by (1) randomly censoring the annotated lesions and (2) systematically censoring the smallest lesions. The latter better models true physician error because smaller lesions are harder to notice than the larger ones. Even with a simulated false negative rate as high as $50% $. applying our loss function to randomly censored data preserves maximum sensitivity at $97% $ of the baseline with uncensored training data. compared to just $10% $ for a standard loss function. For the size-based censorship. performance is restored from $17% $ with the current standard to $88% $ with our lopsided bootstrap loss.

The trainable pre-processing module can generate learned inputs with better diversity and more pertinent features as compared to those derived inputs produced by hand-selected pre-processing methods. The backbone module implements a novel attention-based multi-scale estimation on a grid network. which can effectively alleviate the bottleneck issue often encountered in the conventional multi-scale approach. The post-processing module helps to reduce the artifacts in the final output. Experimental results indicate that the GridDehazeNet outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-world images.

Input frames are warped according to flow-like information to eliminate inter-frame differences. These methods have to make a trade-off between the distraction caused by spatio-temporal inconsistency and the pixel-wise detail damage caused by compensation.

With the rapid rise of deep learning. many recently proposed video super-resolution methods use convolutional neural networks in conjunction with explicit motion compensation to capitalize on statistical dependencies within and across low-resolution frames. Two common issues of such methods are noteworthy. Firstly. the quality of the final reconstructed HR video is often very sensitive to the accuracy of motion estimation. Secondly. the warp grid needed for motion compensation. which is specified by the two flow maps delineating pixel displacements in horizontal and vertical directions. tends to introduce additional errors and jeopardize the temporal consistency across video frames. To address these issues. we propose a novel dynamic local filter network to perform implicit motion estimation and compensation by employing. via locally connected layers. sample-specific and position-specific dynamic local filters that are tailored to the target pixels. We also propose a global refinement network based on ResBlock and autoencoder structures to exploit non-local correlations and enhance the spatial consistency of super-resolved frames.

PSCC-Net processes the image in a two-path procedure: a top-down path that extracts local and global features and a bottom-up path that detects whether the input image is manipulated. and estimates its manipulation masks at 4 scales. where each mask is conditioned on the previous one. Different from the conventional encoder-decoder and no-pooling structures. PSCC-Net leverages features at different scales with dense cross-connections to produce manipulation masks in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Moreover. a Spatio-Channel Correlation Module (SCCM) captures both spatial and channel-wise correlations in the bottom-up path. which endows features with holistic cues. enabling the network to cope with a wide range of manipulation attacks. Thanks to the light-weight backbone and progressive mechanism. PSCC-Net can process 1.080 P images at 50+ FPS.

However. due to the limited size of camera sensors on phone. the photographed image is still visually distinct to the one taken by the digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera. To narrow this performance gap. one is to redesign the camera image signal processor (ISP) to improve the image quality. Owing to the rapid rise of deep learning. recent works resort to the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to develop a sophisticated data-driven ISP that directly maps the phone-captured image to the DSLR-captured one. In this paper. we introduce a novel network that utilizes the attention mechanism and wavelet transform. dubbed AWNet. to tackle this learnable image ISP problem. By adding the wavelet transform. our proposed method enables us to restore favorable image details from RAW information and achieve a larger receptive field while remaining high efficiency in terms of computational cost. The global context block is adopted in our method to learn the non-local color mapping for the generation of appealing RGB images. More importantly. this block alleviates the influence of image misalignment occurred on the provided dataset.

How to build appropriate sparse models. how to numerically find solutions from the sparse models and how to derive theoretical guarantees of the correctness of the solutions are essential for the success of sparsity in applications. In this thesis. we study sparse modeling in image processing and machine learning. We propose a novel two-stage (projection followed by correction) modeling framework for image reconstruction from nonuniform Fourier measurements. We design domain adaptive sparsity regularization schemes that are able to maintain image smoothness as well as edge details. Various numerical results in both one-dimensional signals and two-dimensional images are also presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared with other methods.,True,aGXLoccAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=case1523017795312546,,,,,https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=case1523017795312546&disposition=inline,0,0,0

A planar square spiral mono coil is printed on an FR-4 substrate. and layers of magnetic sheets are attached to the substrate. The coil geometry is modelled using the finite-element method. and the static magnetic field distributions are compared. With the magnetic sheet backing. the magnetic field is shown to increase in the target direction and to decrease in the opposite direction. The coils are fabricated and applied to a PI MD system. It is demonstrated that the proposed magnetic sheet-backed search coils have longer detection ranges than the coil without magnetic sheet backing.,True,aqbVhdkAAAAJ:3jqAvCjcdfEC,2,https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/el.2014.2116,8465557170233045306,/scholar?cites=8465557170233045306,,,https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/el.2014.2116,0,0,0

Since landmines have diverse sizes. it is critical to select an appropriate window size to represent the landmine region consistently. Conventional detection systems are incapable of extracting consistent landmine features because they employ fixed window sizes. This paper proposes a window size selection method according to the size of a landmine. The proposed method selects an appropriate window size based on the type of a landmine estimated from the response signal of the system. Data on various types of soils and landmines were generated from a simulation program to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results verified that the proposed method. which employs an adaptive window size. yields a better landmine detection rate than the conventional methods. which employ fixed window sizes.,True,aqbVhdkAAAAJ:pe4chHNxNLUC,2,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201422354180218.page,10388675168703247478,/scholar?cites=10388675168703247478,,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201422354180218.pdf,0,0,0

Most of the conventional SSL methods assume that the classes of unlabeled data are included in the set of classes of labeled data.

The severity of OSA can lead to many symptoms such as sudden cardiac death (SCD). Polysomnography (PSG) is a gold standard for OSA diagnosis.

Each frequency represents one command to control a machine. For example. multiple target stimuli with different frequencies can be used to control the moving speeds of a robot. Each target stimulus frequency corresponds to a speed level. Such a conventional SSVEPBCI is choice selection paradigm with discrete information. allowing users to discretely control the speed of a movable object. This can result in non-smooth object movement. To overcome the problem. in this study. a conceptual design of a SSVEP-BCI with continuous information for continuous control is proposed to allow users to control the moving speed of an object smoothly. A predictive model for SSVEP magnitude variation plays an important role in the proposed design. Thus. this study mainly focuses on a feasibility study concerning the use of SSVEP magnitude prediction for BCI. A basic experiment is therefore conducted to gather SSVEP responses from varying stimulus intensity using times with a fixed frequency. Random Forest Regression (RF) is outperformed by simple regression and neural networks in these predictive tasks. Finally. the advantages of the proposed SSVEP-BCI is demonstrated by streaming real SSVEP responses from ten healthy subjects into a brain-controlled robotic simulator.

The importance of NEs has been observed in intranet search engines. including university web sites. In this paper. a mechanism is built exclusively to recognize the three named entities. which are constantly referenced in the University of Essex domain: names. course codes. and room numbers. While a person name is considered a common named entity. course codes and room numbers are specific to the University domain. We developed a technique specifically to train three different classifiers on electronic corpora. consisting of 16.629 examples in total. which were collected and annotated manually from the University domain.

1286544,Minimally-supervised Methods for Arabic Named Entity Recognition,2016,Maha Althobaiti,,,,,,Named Entity Recognition (NER) has attracted much attention over the past twenty years. as a main task of Information Extraction. The current dominant techniques for addressing NER are supervised methods that can achieve high performance. but require new manually annotated data for every new domain and/or genre change. Our work focuses on approaches that make it possible to tackle new domains with minimal human intervention to identify Named Entities (NEs) in Arabic text. Specifically. we investigate two minimally-supervised methods: semi-supervised learning and distant learning. Our semi-supervised algorithm for identifying NEs does not require annotated training data or gazetteers. It only requires. for each NE type. a seed list of a few instances to initiate the learning process. Novel aspects of our algorithm include (i) a new way to produce and generalise the extraction patterns (ii) a new filtering criterion to remove noisy patterns (iii) a comparison of two ranking measures for determining the most reliable candidate NEs. Next. we present our methodology to exploit Wikipedia structure to automatically develop an Arabic NE annotated corpus. A novel mechanism is introduced. based on the high coverage of Wikipedia. in order to address two challenges particular to tagging NEs in Arabic text: rich morphology and the absence of capitalisation. Neither technique has yet achieved performance levels comparable to those of supervised methods. Semi-supervised algorithms tend to have high precision but comparatively low recall. whereas distant learning tends to achieve higher recall but lower precision.

1286545,Automatic Arabic Dialect Identification Systems for Written Texts: A Survey,2020,Maha J. Althobaiti,,,,,,Arabic dialect identification is a specific task of natural language processing. aiming to automatically predict the Arabic dialect of a given text. Arabic dialect identification is the first step in various natural language processing applications such as machine translation. multilingual text-to-speech synthesis. and cross-language text generation. Therefore. in the last decade. interest has increased in addressing the problem of Arabic dialect identification. In this paper. we present a comprehensive survey of Arabic dialect identification research in written texts. We first define the problem and its challenges. Then. the survey extensively discusses in a critical manner many aspects related to Arabic dialect identification task. So. we review the traditional machine learning methods. deep learning architectures. and complex learning approaches to Arabic dialect identification. We also detail the features and techniques for feature representations used to train the proposed systems. Moreover. we illustrate the taxonomy of Arabic dialects studied in the literature. the various levels of text processing at which Arabic dialect identification are conducted (eg. token. sentence. and document level). as well as the available annotated resources. including evaluation benchmark corpora.

Our general non-linear asset pricing model is estimated with deep neural networks applied to all US equity data combined with a substantial set of macroeconomic and firm-specific information. We estimate the stochastic discount factor that explains all asset returns from the conditional moment constraints implied by no-arbitrage. Our asset pricing model outperforms out-of-sample all other benchmark approaches in terms of Sharpe ratio. explained variation and pricing errors. We trace its superior performance to including the no-arbitrage constraint in the estimation and to accounting for macroeconomic conditions and non-linear interactions between firm-specific characteristics. Our generative adversarial network enforces no-arbitrage by identifying the portfolio strategies with the most pricing information.

The introduction of the ReLUs establishes an efficient gradient propagation. induces sparsity in the proposed network. and is efficient in terms of computations making these networks suitable for real time compression systems. Experiments performed on standard real world images show that using ReLUs instead of logistic sigmoid units speeds up the training of the DNN by converging markedly faster. The evaluation of objective and subjective quality of reconstructed images also proves that our DNN achieves better generalization as most of the images are never seen by the network before.,True,Ceah4QsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,21,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/3184840/abs/,4438536735035752447,/scholar?cites=4438536735035752447,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/3184840/abs/,0,0,0

This task becomes challenging due to inclusion of noise in acquisition process owing to number of different factors. In this paper we propose a system for heart sound localization and classification into S1 and S2. The proposed system introduces the concept of quality assessment before localization. feature extraction and classification of heart sounds. Methods: The signal quality is assessed by predefined criteria based upon number of peaks and zero crossing of PCG signal. Once quality assessment is performed. then heart beats within PCG signal are localized. which is done by envelope extraction using homomorphic envelogram and finding prominent peaks.

One of the problems faced by drivers is the faded scene visibility and lower contrast while driving in foggy conditions. In this paper. we present a novel approach to provide a solution to this problem by employing deep neural networks. We assume that the fog in an image can be mathematically modeled by an unknown complex function and we utilize the deep neural network to approximate the corresponding mathematical model for the fog. The advantages of our technique are as follows: (i) its real-time operation and (ii) being based on minimal input. that is. a single image. and exhibiting robustness/generalization for various unseen image data. Experiments carried out on various synthetic images indicate that our proposed technique has the abilities to approximate the corresponding fog function reasonably and remove it for better visibility and safety.,True,Ceah4QsAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,17,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/3894832/abs/,16779388846458410148,/scholar?cites=16779388846458410148,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/3894832/abs/,0,0,0

Given that conventional button-and touch-based interfaces may distract the driver. developing novel distraction-free interfaces for the various devices present in cars has becomes necessary. Hand gesture recognition may provide an alternative interface inside cars. Given that cars are the targeted application area. we determined the optimal location for the radar sensor. so that the signal reflected from the driver’s hand during gesturing is unaffected by interference from the motion of the driver’s body or other motions within the car. We implemented a Convolutional Neural Network-based technique to recognize the finger-counting-based hand gestures using an Impulse Radio (IR) radar sensor.

Currently. the PV market is dominated by crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells which accounts for more than 80% of the share. Lower cost. optimized process parameters and improved PV cell efficiencies are required to reduce the overall cost per watt peak (W). In this regard. PV cell manufacturers are currently adopting thinner wafers. which tends to increase the surface recombination velocity (SRV). Excellent surface passivation at the front and rear of the PV cell becomes imperative for realizing superior efficienciy on c-Si substrates.

The analysis of the results allows concluding that the effectiveness of a RE can be improved if the age of the data. and if a global view of the data is considered.

Emerging initiatives use low-cost receivers in large deployments for sensing the radio spectrum or collecting air-traffic signals at large scale. One of the major drawbacks of low-cost spectrum receivers is their limited sampling rate. which does not allow to decode wideband signals. In order to circumvent the hardware limitations of single receivers. we envision a scenario where non-coherent receivers sample the signal collaboratively to cover a larger bandwidth than the one of the single receiver and then. enable the signal reconstruction and decoding in the backend.

Action recognition methods designed for third person videos may not optimally represent actions captured by first-person videos. We propose a method to represent the high level dynamics of sub-events in first-person videos by dynamically pooling features of sub-intervals of time series using a temporal feature pooling function. The sub-event dynamics are then temporally aligned to make a new series. To keep track of how the sub-event dynamics evolve over time. we recursively employ the Fast Fourier Transform on a pyramidal temporal structure. The Fourier coefficients of the segment define the overall video representation. We perform experiments on two existing benchmark first-person video datasets which have been captured in a controlled environment. Addressing this gap. we introduce a new dataset collected from YouTube which has a larger number of classes and a greater diversity of capture conditions thereby more closely depicting real-world challenges in first-person video analysis.

The advantage of the proposed method is that only one Lyapunov equation needs to be solved in order to obtain the information regarding the frequency interval controllability and observability of the system. In addition this method overcomes the limitations of using cross Gramians which are not applicable for filters with complex coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a numerical example.1. Introduction. Complex FIR filters are often utilized when the filter design criteria for a particular application requires an asymmetric magnitude response [14. 2. 13. 17. 15]. Complex FIR filters can be designed by first designing a real FIR filter using one of the standard filter design methods followed by a suitable frequency transformation process. Complex FIR filters have been widely used in a variety of applications such as seismic migration. image and audio signal processing. notch filters and variable fractional delay filters. One of the disadvantages of an FIR filter design is that in order to obtain an FIR filter which meets the particular design criteria. a high order filter is necessary. This holds true for both FIR filters with real coefficients and also complex coefficients. In order to mitigate the problems associated with high order filters such as increased computational complexity. storage space and simulation times.

Management of international sporting and recreational events also require satisfactory road and pavement conditions. Before pavement conditions can be improved. it is an essential prerequisite to obtain comprehensive information about road irregularities such as the location and also severity of the road irregularity (depth of the potholes and height of bumps).

The demand for data sharing is increasing day by day due to the tremendous knowledge hidden in the digital data that is generated by humans and machines. However. data cannot be published as such due to the information leaks that can occur by linking the published data with other publically available datasets or with the help of some background knowledge. Various anonymization techniques have been proposed by researchers for privacy preserving sensitive data publishing. This paper proposes a (k. n. m) anonymity approach for sensitive data publishing by making use of the traditional k-anonymity technique. The selection of quasi identifiers is automated in this approach using graph theoretic algorithms and is further enhanced by choosing similar quasi identifiers based on the derived and composite attributes. The usual method of choosing a single value of ‘k’is modified in this technique by selecting different values of ‘k’for the same dataset based on the risk of exposure and sensitivity rank of the sensitive attributes. The proposed anonymity approach can be used for sensitive big data publishing after applying few extension mechanisms.

It is a challenging task because of the poor distinguishability of features and the missing values in practice. A novel multi-task based neural network. SurvNet. is proposed in this paper. The proposed SurvNet model is trained in a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn across three related tasks: input reconstruction. survival classification. and Cox regression. It uses an input reconstruction mechanism cooperating with incomplete-aware reconstruction loss for latent feature learning of incomplete data with missing values. Besides. the SurvNet model introduces a context gating mechanism to bridge the gap between survival classification and Cox regression. A new real-world dataset of 1.137 patients with IB-IIA stage nonsmall cell lung cancer is collected to evaluate the performance of the SurvNet model. The proposed SurvNet achieves a higher concordance index than the traditional Cox model and Cox-Net. The difference between high-risk and low-risk groups obtained by SurvNet is more significant than that of high-risk and low-risk groups obtained by the other models.

Despite much attention. however. progress towards more robust models is significantly impaired by the difficulty of evaluating the robustness of neural network models. Today's methods are either fast but brittle (gradient-based attacks). or they are fairly reliable but slow (score-and decision-based attacks). We here develop a new set of gradient-based adversarial attacks which (a) are more reliable in the face of gradient-masking than other gradient-based attacks.(b) perform better and are more query efficient than current state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks.(c) can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of adversarial criteria and (d) require virtually no hyperparameter tuning. These findings are carefully validated across a diverse set of six different models and hold for L0. L1. L2 and Linf in both targeted as well as untargeted scenarios. Implementations will soon be available in all major toolboxes (Foolbox. CleverHans and ART).

However. current generative models lack the ability to capture the inherently compositional and layered nature of visual scenes. While recent work has made progress towards unsupervised learning of object-based scene representations. most models still maintain a global representation space (ie. objects are not explicitly separated). and cannot generate scenes with novel object arrangement and depth ordering. Here. we present an alternative approach which uses an inductive bias encouraging modularity by training an ensemble of generative models (experts). During training. experts compete for explaining parts of a scene. and thus specialise on different object classes. with objects being identified as parts that re-occur across multiple scenes. Our model allows for controllable sampling of individual objects and recombination of experts in physically plausible ways. In contrast to other methods. depth layering and occlusion are handled correctly. moving this approach closer to a causal generative scene model.

Fitting a GP implies computing a posterior distribution of functions consistent with the observed data. Similarly. deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) should allow us to compute a posterior distribution of compositions of multiple functions giving rise to the observations. However. exact Bayesian inference is intractable for DGPs. motivating the use of various approximations. We show that the application of simplifying mean-field assumptions across the hierarchy leads to the layers of a DGP collapsing to near-deterministic transformations. We argue that such an inference scheme is suboptimal. not taking advantage of the potential of the model to discover the compositional structure in the data.

In addition. we consider the utility of a monotonic random process as a part of a hierarchical probabilistic model; we examine the task of temporal alignment of time-series data where it is beneficial to use a monotonic random process in order to preserve the uncertainty in the temporal warpings.,True,YGEMpYUAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,5,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/ustyuzhaninov20a.html,17770519516897284460,/scholar?cites=17770519516897284460,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/ustyuzhaninov20a/ustyuzhaninov20a.pdf,0,0,0
1286636,Towards Nonlinear Disentanglement in Natural Data with Temporal Sparse Coding,2020,David Klindt and Lukas Schott and Yash Sharma and Ivan Ustyuzhaninov and Wieland Brendel and Matthias Bethge and Dylan Paiton,,,,,https://openreview.net/forum?id=EbIDjBynYJ8,We construct an unsupervised learning model that achieves nonlinear disentanglement of underlying factors of variation in naturalistic videos. Previous work suggests that representations can be disentangled if all but a few factors in the environment stay constant at any point in time. As a result. algorithms proposed for this problem have only been tested on carefully constructed datasets with this exact property. leaving it unclear whether they will transfer to natural scenes. Here we provide evidence that objects in segmented natural movies undergo transitions that are typically small in magnitude with occasional large jumps. which is characteristic of a temporally sparse distribution. We leverage this finding and present SlowVAE. a model for unsupervised representation learning that uses a sparse prior on temporally adjacent observations to disentangle generative factors without any assumptions on the number of changing factors. We provide a proof of identifiability and show that the model reliably learns disentangled representations on several established benchmark datasets. often surpassing the current state-of-the-art. We additionally demonstrate transferability towards video datasets with natural dynamics.

Ecker,,,,,https://openreview.net/forum?id=rklr9kHFDB,Similar to a convolutional neural network (CNN). the mammalian retina encodes visual information into several dozen nonlinear feature maps. each formed by one ganglion cell type that tiles the visual space in an approximately shift-equivariant manner. Whether such organization into distinct cell types is maintained at the level of cortical image processing is an open question. Predictive models building upon convolutional features have been shown to provide state-of-the-art performance. and have recently been extended to include rotation equivariance in order to account for the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons. However. generally no direct correspondence between CNN feature maps and groups of individual neurons emerges in these models. thus rendering it an open question whether V1 neurons form distinct functional clusters.

1286638,Sequence Alignment with Dirichlet Process Mixtures,2018,Ieva Kazlauskaite and Ivan Ustyuzhaninov and Carl Henrik Ek and Neill DF Campbell,,,,,,We present a probabilistic model for unsupervised alignment of high-dimensional time-warped sequences based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). We follow the approach introduced in (Kazlauskaite. 2018) of simultaneously representing each data sequence as a composition of a true underlying function and a time-warping. both of which are modelled using Gaussian processes (GPs)(Rasmussen. 2005). and aligning the underlying functions using an unsupervised alignment method. In (Kazlauskaite. 2018) the alignment is performed using the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM)(Lawrence. 2005) as a model of sequences. while our main contribution is extending this approach to using DPMM. which allows us to align the sequences temporally and cluster them at the same time. We show that the DPMM achieves competitive results in comparison to the GP-LVM on synthetic and real-world data sets. and discuss the different properties of the estimated underlying functions and the time-warps favoured by these models.,True,YGEMpYUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10689,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10689,0,0,0
1286639,Texture synthesis using random shallow neural networks,2016,I Ustyuzhaninov and W Brendel and L Gatys and M Bethge,,,,233-234,,Natural image generation is currently one of the most actively explored fields in Deep Learning. A surprising recent result has been that feature representations from networks trained on a purely discriminative task can be used for state-of-the-art image synthesis (Gatys et al.. 2015). However. it is still unclear what aspects of the pre-trained network are critical for high generative performance. It could be. for example. the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in terms of the number of layers. specific pooling techniques. the connection between filter complexity and filter scale (larger filters are more non-linear). the training task and the network’s performance on that task or the data it was trained on. To explore the importance of learnt filters and deep architectures. we here consider the task of synthesising natural textures using only a single-layer CNN with completely random filters. Our surprising finding is that we can synthesise natural textures of high perceptual quality that sometimes even rival current state-of-the-art methods (Gatys et al.. 2015; Liu et al.. 2016) which rely on deep. supervisedly trained multi-layer representations. We hence conclude that neither the supervised training nor the depth of the architecture is indispensable for natural texture generation. Furthermore. we evaluate the importance of other architectural aspects of random CNNs for natural texture synthesis. For that we introduce a new quantitative measure of texture quality based on the state-of-the-art parametric texture model by Gatys et al. This measure allows us to objectively quantify the performance of each architecture and perform a large-scale grid …,True,YGEMpYUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2547156,,,,,,0,0,0

We first propose a new set of timing-related features based on burst-level characteristics to further identify more ways that timing patterns could be used by classifiers to identify sites. Then we evaluate the effectiveness of both raw timing and directional timing which is a combination of raw timing and direction in a deep-learning-based WF attack. Our closed-world evaluation shows that directional timing performs best in most of the settings we explored. achieving:(i) 98.4% in undefended Tor traffic;(ii) 93.5% on WTF-PAD traffic. several points higher than when only directional information is used; and (iii) 64.7% against onion sites. 12% higher than using only direction. Further evaluations in the open-world setting show small increases in both precision (+ 2%) and recall (+ 6%) with directional-timing on WTF-PAD traffic. To further investigate the value of timing information. we perform an information leakage analysis on our proposed handcrafted features.

1286650,SubRosa 2: An Experimental Evaluation Of Timing Analysis Attacks And Defenses In Anonymity Systems,2013,Payap Sirinam,,,,,,A circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication service such as Tor helps  Internet users hide their IP addresses and thereby conceal their identities when communicating online. However. this kind of service is vulnerable to timing analysis attacks that can discern the relationship between incoming and outgoing messsages in order to find correlations between them. The attacker can use this information to reveal the idenity of the internet users without knowing the IP addresses concealed in the anonymous communication services.Dependent link padding (DLP) is a scheme propsed to enable anonymity systems to resist these attacks. However. DLP adds high overhead from dummy packets in the network systems. resulting in poor quality of service. We have developed a Tor-like experimental evaluation platform called SubRosa 2 for studying and investigating the overall dummy packets overhead on each scheme that is used to prevent timing timing analysis attacks. We have developed our platform on real distributed networks by using the DETERLab network testbed. which is a public facility for medium-scale repeatable experiments in computer security. In our experiments. we evaluated DLP and reduced overhead dependent link padding (RO-DLP).  Furthermore. We compared these schemes to a recently-proposed technique called selective grouping (SG) that aims to further reduce overhead from dummy packets in the  padding algorithms at the cost of some anonymity.Through evaluations of the whole anonymity systems. we validated that RO-DLP could significantly reduce dummy packet overhead and enable larger number of users …,True,1-WhZZMAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/handle/10106/11575,,,,,https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/11575/Sirinam_uta_2502M_11859.pdf,0,0,0

By recording and analyzing ambient noise. a seismic network can image underground infrastructures and provide velocity variation information of the subsurface that can help to detect anomalies. By studying the variation in the noise cross-correlation function of the noise. it is possible to determine the subsurface seismic velocity and image underground infrastructures. Ambient noise imaging can be done in a decentralized fashion using Distributed Spatial Auto-Correlation (dSPAC). In dSPAC over sensor networks. the cross-correlation is the most intensive communication process since nodes need to communicate their data with neighbor nodes. In this paper. a new communication-reduced method for cross-correlation is presented to meet bandwidth and cost of communication constraints in networks while ambient noise imaging is performed using dSPAC method. By applying the proposed communication-reduced method. we show that energy and computational cost of the nodes is also preserved.

1286672,Sprsf: Sparse phase retrieval via smoothing function,2018,Samuel Pinilla and Jorge Bacca and Henry Arguello,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.09703,,,,Phase retrieval (PR) is an ill-conditioned inverse problem which can be found in various science and engineering applications. Assuming sparse priority over the signal of interest. recent algorithms have been developed to solve the phase retrieval problem. Some examples include SparseAltMinPhase (SAMP). Sparse Wirtinger flow (SWF) and Sparse Truncated Amplitude flow (SPARTA). However. the optimization cost functions of the mentioned algorithms are non-convex and non-smooth. In order to fix the non-smoothness of the cost function. the SPARTA method uses truncation thresholds to calculate a truncated step update direction. In practice. the truncation procedure requires calculating more parameters to obtain a desired performance in the phase recovery. Therefore. this paper proposes an algorithm called SPRSF (Sparse Phase retrieval via Smoothing Function) to solve the sparse PR problem by introducing a smoothing function. SPRSF is an iterative algorithm where the update step is obtained by a hard thresholding over a gradient descent direction. Theoretical analyses show that the smoothing function uniformly approximates the non-convex and non-smooth sparse PR optimization problem. Moreover. SPRSF does not require the truncation procedure used in SPARTA. Numerical tests demonstrate that SPRSF performs better than state-of-the-art methods. especially when there is no knowledge about the sparsity . In particular. SPRSF attains a higher mean recovery rate in comparison with SPARTA. SAMP and SWF methods. when the sparsity varies for the real and complex cases.

However. radar data is sparse and noisy. resulting in challenges for radar mapping. On the other hand. the most popular available map currently is built by lidar. In this paper. we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for Radar Localization on Lidar Map (RaLL) to bridge the gap. which not only achieves the robust radar localization but also exploits the mature lidar mapping technique. thus reducing the cost of radar mapping. We first embed both sensor modals into a common feature space by a neural network. Then multiple offsets are added to the map modal for exhaustive similarity evaluation against the current radar modal. yielding the regression of the current pose.

This problem is called place recognition. In recent years. LiDAR scan based place recognition has drawn attention as it is robust against the appearance change. In this letter. we propose a LiDAR-based place recognition method. named Differentiable Scan Context with Orientation (DiSCO). which simultaneously finds the scan at a similar place and estimates their relative orientation. The orientation can further be used as the initial value for the down-stream local optimal metric pose estimation. improving the pose estimation especially when a large orientation between the current scan and retrieved scan exists. Our key idea is to transform the feature into the frequency domain. We utilize the magnitude of the spectrum as the place descriptor. which is theoretically rotation-invariant.

Therefore. the ability to keep customers in a brand is becoming more challenging these days. Churn happens when a customer leaves a brand to another competitor. Most of the previous work considers the problem of churn prediction using the Call Detail Records (CDRs). In this paper. we use micro-posts to classify customers into churny or non-churny. We explore the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) since they achieved state-of-the-art in various computer vision and NLP applications. However. the robustness of end-to-end models has some limitations such as the availability of a large amount of labeled data and uninterpretability of these models. We investigate the use of CNNs augmented with structured logic rules to overcome or reduce this issue. We developed our system called Churn_teacher by using an iterative distillation method that transfers the knowledge. extracted using just the combination of three logic rules. directly into the weight of the DNNs. Furthermore. we used weight normalization to speed up training our convolutional neural networks.

Typically. a common assumption used in visual tracking is that the raw video sequences are clear. while real-world data is with significant noise and irrelevant patterns. Consequently. the learned features may be not all relevant and noisy. To address this problem. we propose a novel visual tracking method via a point-wise gated convolutional deep network (CPGDN) that jointly performs the feature learning and feature selection in a unified framework. The proposed method performs dynamic feature selection on raw features through a gating mechanism. Therefore. the proposed method can adaptively focus on the task-relevant patterns (i.e.. a target object). while ignoring the task-irrelevant patterns (i.e.. the surrounding background of a target object). Specifically. inspired by transfer learning. we firstly pre-train an object appearance model offline to learn generic image features and then transfer rich feature hierarchies from an offline pre-trained CPGDN into online tracking. In online tracking. the pre-trained CPGDN model is fine-tuned to adapt to the tracking specific objects. Finally. to alleviate the tracker drifting problem. inspired by an observation that a visual target should be an object rather than not. we combine an edge box-based object proposal method to further improve the tracking accuracy.

Offline pre-training is time-consuming. and the learned generic representation may be either less discriminative for tracking specific objects or overfitted to typical tracking datasets. In this paper. we propose an online discriminative tracking method based on robust feature learning without large-scale pre-training.

To achieve superior speed and great discriminative power. correlation filter based trackers are equipped with circulant matrix and fast Fourier transform (FFT). which implicitly use a large amount of samples to efficiently train the correlation filters and contribute significantly to model complexity. However. the number of training samples is significantly reduced when a target's size is small. Consequently. the performance of the resulting correlation filter based trackers may be inhibited. Moreover. how to cope with the scale variations and the tracker drift is still an open problem.

Extensive navigation strategies have been studied and developed. but few focus on scenarios with reconfigurable robot agents. This paper proposes a navigation strategy that accomplishes complete path planning for a Tetris-inspired hinge-based self-reconfigurable robot (hTetro). which consists of two main phases. In the first phase. polyomino form-based tilesets are generated to cover the predefined area based on the tiling theory. which generates a series of unsequenced waypoints that guarantee complete coverage of the entire workspace. Each waypoint specifies the position of the robot and the robot morphology on the map. In the second phase. an energy consumption evaluation model is constructed in order to determine a valid strategy to generate the sequence of the waypoints. The cost value between waypoints is formulated under the consideration of the hTetro robot platform’s kinematic design. where we calculate the minimum sum of displacement of the four blocks in the hTetro robot. With the cost function determined. the waypoint sequencing problem is then formulated as a travelling salesman problem (TSP). In this paper. a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed as a strong candidate to solve the TSP. The GA produces a viable navigation sequence for the hTetro robot to follow and to accomplish complete coverage tasks.

1286756,Stacked 1D convolutional networks for end-to-end small footprint voice trigger detection,2020,Takuya Higuchi and Mohammad Ghasemzadeh and Kisun You and Chandra Dhir,,,,,,We propose a stacked 1D convolutional neural network (S1DCNN) for end-to-end small footprint voice trigger detection in a streaming scenario. Voice trigger detection is an important speech application. with which users can activate their devices by simply saying a keyword or phrase. Due to privacy and latency reasons. a voice trigger detection system should run on an always-on processor on device. Therefore. having small memory and compute cost is crucial for a voice trigger detection system. Recently. singular value decomposition filters (SVDFs) has been used for end-to-end voice trigger detection. The SVDFs approximate a fully-connected layer with a low rank approximation. which reduces the number of model parameters. In this work. we propose S1DCNN as an alternative approach for end-to-end small-footprint voice trigger detection. An S1DCNN layer consists of a 1D convolution layer followed by a depth-wise 1D convolution layer. We show that the SVDF can be expressed as a special case of the S1DCNN layer. Experimental results show that the S1DCNN achieve 19.0% relative false reject ratio (FRR) reduction with a similar model size and a similar time delay compared to the SVDF. By using longer time delays. the S1DCNN further improve the FRR up to 12.2% relative.,True,j32u9VYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,3,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03405,14703445282973655198,/scholar?cites=14703445282973655198,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03405,0,0,0

Keyword-based search methods have been widely used due to their ease of use. but their search accuracy has been often problematic because of the semantic ambiguity of terminologies in engineering documents and queries. The semantic ambiguity can be alleviated by using a domain ontology. Also. if queries are expanded to incorporate the engineer’s personalized information needs. the accuracy of the search result would be improved. Therefore. we propose a framework to search engineering documents with less semantic ambiguity and more focus on each engineer’s personalized information needs.

In order to tackle the multi-label classification on this challenging dataset. it is necessary to solve several issues such as temporal modeling of videos. label imbalances. and correlations between labels. We develop a deep neural network model. which consists of four components: the frame encoder. the classification layer. the label processing layer. and the loss function. We introduce our newly proposed methods and discusses how existing models operate in the YouTube-8M Classification Task. what insights they have. and why they succeed (or fail) to achieve good performance.

Cham,Evaluation of cryptographic implementations against profiled side-channel attacks plays a fundamental role in security testing nowadays. Recently. deep neural networks and especially Convolutional Neural Networks have been introduced as a new tool for that purpose. Although having several practical advantages over common Gaussian templates such as intrinsic feature extraction. the deep-learning-based profiling techniques proposed in literature still require a suitable leakage model for the implementation under test. Since this is a crucial task. we are introducing domain knowledge to exploit the full power of approximating very complex functions with neural networks. By doing so. we are able to attack the secret key directly without any assumption about the leakage behavior.

1286820,Domain-invariant projection learning for zero-shot recognition,2018,An Zhao and Mingyu Ding and Jiechao Guan and Zhiwu Lu and Tao Xiang and Ji-Rong Wen,31,,,1025-1036,,Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen object classes without any training samples. which can be regarded as a form of transfer learning from seen classes to unseen ones. This is made possible by learning a projection between a feature space and a semantic space (eg attribute space). Key to ZSL is thus to learn a projection function that is robust against the often large domain gap between the seen and unseen classes. In this paper. we propose a novel ZSL model termed domain-invariant projection learning (DIPL). Our model has two novel components:(1) A domain-invariant feature self-reconstruction task is introduced to the seen/unseen class data. resulting in a simple linear formulation that casts ZSL into a min-min optimization problem. Solving the problem is non-trivial. and a novel iterative algorithm is formulated as the solver. with rigorous theoretic algorithm analysis provided.(2) To further align the two domains via the learned projection. shared semantic structure among seen and unseen classes is explored via forming superclasses in the semantic space.

1286821,Learning depth-guided convolutions for monocular 3d object detection,2020,Mingyu Ding and Yuqi Huo and Hongwei Yi and Zhe Wang and Jianping Shi and Zhiwu Lu and Ping Luo,,,,11672-11681,,3D object detection from a single image without LiDAR is a challenging task due to the lack of accurate depth information. Conventional 2D convolutions are unsuitable for this task because they fail to capture local object and its scale information. which are vital for 3D object detection. To better represent 3D structure. prior arts typically transform depth maps estimated from 2D images into a pseudo-LiDAR representation. and then apply existing 3D point-cloud based object detectors. However. their results depend heavily on the accuracy of the estimated depth maps. resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work. instead of using pseudo-LiDAR representation. we improve the fundamental 2D fully convolutions by proposing a new local convolutional network (LCN). termed Depth-guided Dynamic-Depthwise-Dilated LCN (D4LCN). where the filters and their receptive fields can be automatically learned from image-based depth maps. making different pixels of different images have different filters. D4LCN overcomes the limitation of conventional 2D convolutions and narrows the gap between image representation and 3D point cloud representation. Extensive experiments show that D4LCN outperforms existing works by large margins. For example. the relative improvement of D4LCN against the state-of-the-art on KITTI is 9.1% in the moderate setting.,True,w4yTWwoAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,36,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/html/w60/Ding_Learning_Depth-Guided_Convolutions_for_Monocular_3D_Object_Detection_CVPRW_2020_paper.html,3992022189090691047,/scholar?cites=3992022189090691047,,,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2020/papers/w60/Ding_Learning_Depth-Guided_Convolutions_for_Monocular_3D_Object_Detection_CVPRW_2020_paper.pdf,0,0,0

Recently. retrieval-based methods have been considered as a promising direction as they can be easily generalized to novel scenes. Despite significant progress has been made. we observe that the performance bottleneck of previous methods actually lies in the retrieval module. These methods use the same features for both retrieval and relative pose regression tasks which have potential conflicts in learning. To this end. here we present a coarse-to-fine retrieval-based deep learning framework. which includes three steps. ie. image-based coarse retrieval. pose-based fine retrieval and precise relative pose regression. With our carefully designed retrieval module. the relative pose regression task can be surprisingly simpler.

It specifically needs to address two problems:(1) Both face and body contain useful cues regarding whether a subject is deceptive. How to effectively fuse the two is thus key to the effectiveness of an ADD model.(2) Real-life deceptive samples are hard to collect; learning with limited training data thus challenges most deep learning based ADD models. In this work. both problems are addressed. Specifically. for face-body multimodal learning. a novel face-focused cross-stream network (FFCSN) is proposed. It differs significantly from the popular two-stream networks in that:(a) face detection is added into the spatial stream to capture the facial expressions explicitly. and (b) correlation learning is performed across the spatial and temporal streams for joint deep feature learning across both face and body. To address the training data scarcity problem. our FFCSN model is trained with both meta learning and adversarial learning.

In this work. we propose a unified model SegVoxelNet to address the above two problems. A semantic context encoder is proposed to leverage the free-of-charge semantic segmentation masks in the bird's eye view.

1286826,Segmenting transparent objects in the wild,2020,Enze Xie and Wenjia Wang and Wenhai Wang and Mingyu Ding and Chunhua Shen and Ping Luo,,,,,,Transparent objects such as windows and bottles made by glass widely exist in the real world. Segmenting transparent objects is challenging because these objects have diverse appearance inherited from the image background. making them had similar appearance with their surroundings. Besides the technical difficulty of this task. only a few previous datasets were specially designed and collected to explore this task and most of the existing datasets have major drawbacks. They either possess limited sample size such as merely a thousand of images without manual annotations. or they generate all images by using computer graphics method (ie not real image). To address this important problem. this work proposes a large-scale dataset for transparent object segmentation. named Trans10K. consisting of 10.428 images of real scenarios with carefully manual annotations. which are 10 times larger than the existing datasets. The transparent objects in Trans10K are extremely challenging due to high diversity in scale. viewpoint and occlusion as shown in Fig. 1. To evaluate the effectiveness of Trans10K. we propose a novel boundary-aware segmentation method. termed TransLab. which exploits boundary as the clue to improve segmentation of transparent objects. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans10K and validate the practicality of learning object boundary in TransLab. For example. TransLab significantly outperforms 20 recent object segmentation methods based on deep learning. showing that this task is largely unsolved.

In most benchmark datasets. only one frame of a video clip is annotated. which makes most supervised methods fail to utilize information from the rest of the frames. To exploit the spatio-temporal information in videos. many previous works use pre-computed optical flows. which encode the temporal consistency to improve the video segmentation. However. the video segmentation and optical flow estimation are still considered as two separate tasks. In this paper. we propose a novel framework for joint video semantic segmentation and optical flow estimation. Semantic segmentation brings semantic information to handle occlusion for more robust optical flow estimation. while the non-occluded optical flow provides accurate pixel-level temporal correspondences to guarantee the temporal consistency of the segmentation. Moreover. our framework is able to utilize both labeled and unlabeled frames in the video through joint training. while no additional calculation is required in inference.

1286828,Domain-adaptive few-shot learning,2021,An Zhao and Mingyu Ding and Zhiwu Lu and Tao Xiang and Yulei Niu and Jiechao Guan and Ji-Rong Wen,,,,1390-1399,,Existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods make the implicit assumption that the few target class samples are from the same domain as the source class samples. However. in practice. this assumption is often invalid--the target classes could come from a different domain. This poses an additional challenge of domain adaptation (DA) with few training samples. In this paper. the problem of domain-adaptive few-shot learning (DA-FSL) is tackled. which is expected to have wide use in real-world scenarios and requires solving FSL and DA in a unified framework. To this end. we propose a novel domain-adversarial prototypical network (DAPN) model. It is designed to address a specific challenge in DA-FSL: the DA objective means that the source and target data distributions need to be aligned. typically through a shared domain-adaptive feature embedding space; but the FSL objective dictates that the target domain per class distribution must be different from that of any source domain class. meaning aligning the distributions across domains may harm the FSL performance. How to achieve global domain distribution alignment whilst maintaining source/target per-class discriminativeness thus becomes the key. Our solution is to explicitly enhance the source/target per-class separation before domain-adaptive feature embedding learning. to alleviate the negative effect of domain alignment on FSL.

Its main difficulty lies in that there often exists a large domain gap between the seen and unseen class domains. Inspired by the fact that an unseen class is not strictly ‘zero-shot’ (thus easier to recognize) if it falls into a superclass that consists of one or more seen classes. we propose a new ZSL model. termed ZSL with superclasses (ZSLS). that leverages the superclasses as the bridge between seen and unseen classes to narrow the domain gap. By generating the superclasses with k-means clustering over all seen and unseen class prototypes. we formulate ZSLS as a min-min optimization problem.

Canada,2020,Sungil Kim and Kwang Hyun Kim and Baehyun Min and Jungtek Lim and Kyungbook Lee,2020,Geofluids,,,Hindawi,This study proposes a deep neural network- (DNN-) based prediction model for creating synthetic log. Unlike previous studies. it focuses on building a reliable prediction model based on two criteria: fit-for-purpose of a target field (the Golden field in Alberta) and compliance with domain knowledge. First. in the target field. the density log has advantages over the sonic log for porosity analysis because of the carbonate depositional environment. Considering the correlation between the density and sonic logs. we determine the sonic log as input and the density log as output for the DNN. Although only five wells have a pair of training data in the field (i.e.. sonic and density logs). we obtain. based on geological knowledge. 29 additional wells sharing the same depositional setting in the Slave Point Formation. After securing the data. 5 wells among the 29 wells are excluded from dataset during preprocessing procedures (elimination of abnormal data and min–max normalisation) to improve the prediction model. Two cases are designed according to usage of the well information at the target field. Case 1 uses only 23 of the surrounding wells to train the prediction model. and another surrounding well is used for model testing. In Case 1. the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm shows a fast and reliable performance and the numbers of neurons in the two hidden layers are of 45 and 14. respectively. In Case 2. the 24 surrounding wells and four wells from the target field are used to train the DNN with the optimised parameters from Case 1.

The trained CAE is recurrently applied in reservoir model calibration without additional forward simulation.

This article proposes a new approach for history matching and uncertainty analysis in oil sands reservoirs. The first step is to set an area affected by the expansion of the steam chamber.

Several realizations are selected based on the same interval sampling and ranked with similar levels in production curve. The sampling weights are assigned proportional to the rankings and one realization is selected accordingly.

Not only in the gesture community. but also in psycholinguistics and psychology. the way how human act with their hands and body is of relevance. To solve the different research questions. a detailed annotation of multimodal data (video and speech) is performed. This annotation is basically performed manually by human raters and it is usually a very time consuming process. In empirical analysis of hand movement behaviour and gesture. the coding system NEUROGES and the annotation tool ELAN are very useful tools in this research domain [1][2]. Although. the manual annotation process is supported very well. it is still a very time consuming process to get at least the basic assignment such as start and end of hand movements to perform the seemingly most simple step. ie. to segment the ongoing flow of behaviour into natural units. We present an automatic video analysis tool that supports the researchers in this exhaustive exercise inspecting and analysing videos that substantially facilitates the segmentation and annotation processes. Many significant events in human body motion can be detected quite robust by modern video analysis tools and therefore speed up the annotation process by a serious amount.

However. there is a paucity of studies that focus on precipitation variability over the region on this time-scale. which is essential for more accurate forecasts and precipitation projections in a changing climate. The dissertation research tries to contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of sub-seasonal precipitation variability over selected regions of tropical Africa. The work includes: (1) analysis of the drivers and mechanisms associated with summer (June-September) precipitation variability in the Blue Nile river basin. (2) assessment of intra-seasonal  influences of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) on the East African long (March-May) and short (October-December) rains. and (3) examination of sub-seasonal impacts of the MJO on Equatorial West Africa’s springtime (March-June) precipitation.

However. not all ENSO and IOD events are associated with significant precipitation anomalies over EA. Our analysis shows that the IOD and ENSO influence EA rainfall by modifying the MJO. Composite analysis of rainfall and outgoing longwave radiation data show that the MJO over the Indian Ocean (phases 2 and 3 of the Wheeler and Hendon index) is associated with significant increase in precipitation over EA during El Niño. In La Niña and non-ENSO years. the MJO over the Indian Ocean has very weak impacts on EA convection and precipitation.

Sayed and Mariam Raheem and Gustavo Gameiro and Mohamed Abou Shousha,8,Translational Vision Science & Technology,3,,Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.,Purpose: To propose automatic segmentation algorithm (AUS) for corneal microlayers on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.Methods: Eighty-two corneal OCT scans were obtained from 45 patients with normal and abnormal corneas. Three testing data sets totaling 75 OCT images were randomly selected. Initially. corneal epithelium and endothelium microlayers are estimated using a corneal mask and locally refined to obtain final segmentation. Flat-epithelium and flat-endothelium images are obtained and vertically projected to locate inner corneal microlayers. Inner microlayers are estimated by translating epithelium and endothelium microlayers to detected locations then refined to obtain final segmentation. Images were segmented by trained manual operators (TMOs) and by the algorithm to assess repeatability (ie. intraoperator error). reproducibility (ie. interoperator and segmentation errors). and running time. A random masked subjective test was conducted by corneal specialists to subjectively grade the segmentation algorithm.Results: Compared with the TMOs. the AUS had significantly less mean intraoperator error (0.53±1.80 vs. 2.32±2.39 pixels; P< 0.0001). it had significantly different mean segmentation error (3.44±3.46 vs. 2.93±3.02 pixels; P< 0.0001). and it had significantly less running time per image (0.19±0.07 vs. 193.95±194.53 seconds; P< 0.0001). The AUS had insignificant subjective grading for microlayer-segmentation grading (4.94±0.32 vs. 4.96±0.24; P= 0.5081). but it had significant subjective grading for regional-segmentation grading (4.96±0.26 vs. 4.79±0.60; P= 0.025).Conclusions: The AUS can reproduce …,True,MvJ6d4cAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,9,https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2735971,13111696445793010578,/scholar?cites=13111696445793010578,,,https://tvst.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2735971,0,0,0

1286885,Exploring the Consistency of the Quality Scores with Machine Learning for Next-Generation Sequencing Experiments,2020,Erdal Cosgun and Min Oh,2020,BioMed Research International,,,Hindawi,Background. Next-generation sequencing enables massively parallel processing. allowing lower cost than the other sequencing technologies. In the subsequent analysis with the NGS data. one of the major concerns is the reliability of variant calls. Although researchers can utilize raw quality scores of variant calling. they are forced to start the further analysis without any preevaluation of the quality scores. Method. We presented a machine learning approach for estimating quality scores of variant calls derived from BWA+GATK. We analyzed correlations between the quality score and these annotations. specifying informative annotations which were used as features to predict variant quality scores. To test the predictive models. we simulated 24 paired-end Illumina sequencing reads with 30x coverage base. Also. twenty-four human genome sequencing reads resulting from Illumina paired-end sequencing with at least 30x coverage were secured from the Sequence Read Archive. Results. Using BWA+GATK. VCFs were derived from simulated and real sequencing reads. We observed that the prediction models learned by RFR outperformed other algorithms in both simulated and real data. The quality scores of variant calls were highly predictable from informative features of GATK Annotation Modules in the simulated human genome VCF data (R2: 96.7%. 94.4%. and 89.8% for RFR. MLR. and NNR. respectively). The robustness of the proposed data-driven models was consistently maintained in the real human genome VCF data (R2: 97.8% and 96.5% for RFR and MLR. respectively).,True,tUomquAAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,0,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/8531502/,,,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/8531502/,0,0,0

Although there are some recent works that have attempted to generate questions from images in the open domain. the task of VQG in the medical domain has not been explored so far. In this paper. we introduce an approach to generation of visual questions about radiology images called VQGR. ie an algorithm that is able to ask a question when shown an image. VQGR first generates new training data from the existing examples. based on contextual word embeddings and image augmentation techniques. It then uses the variational auto-encoders model to encode images into a latent space and decode natural language questions. Experimental automatic evaluations performed on the VQA-RAD dataset of clinical visual questions show that VQGR achieves good performances compared with the baseline system.

Its combustion leads to explode with extreme violence in environment and safety control. A highly effective sensor for C2H2 detection is essential instrument for solving problem. Therefore. we aim to develop an effective thick film solid state molecular sensor based on nn semiconductor heterojunction of nanocrystalline tungsten oxide-tin oxide (WO3-SnO2) compound in order to early detection of C2H2. We examine the effects of the nanostructure of sintered SnO2 solid state gas sensors and the influences of W doped SnO2 (WTO) concentration on the sensitivity and electrical properties to C2H2. The WTO gas sensor was fabricated by using the screen printing technique. The series of doped substrates with various WO3 loadings from 1-70 wt.% were tested and measured for the electrical resistances in normal atmosphere and also for the sensor response to C2H2. The results showed that with W doping by range of 0.1-0.5 wt.%. the electrical resistances of films lowered significantly. Their optimal conditions for C2H2 sensor showed the sintering temperature (ST) of 600 ํ C for 6 h and the composition of 0.5 wt.% WTO at the optimum operating temperature of 300 ํ C. The C2H2 sensor sensitivities were further improved from 1.792 (pure SnO2) to 2.527 through the best sensor prototype.

1286923,End-to-end pore extraction and matching in latent fingerprints: going beyond minutiae,2019,Dinh-Luan Nguyen and Anil K Jain,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.11472,,,,Latent fingerprint recognition is not a new topic but it has attracted a lot of attention from researchers in both academia and industry over the past 50 years. With the rapid development of pattern recognition techniques. automated fingerprint identification systems (AFIS) have become more and more ubiquitous. However. most AFIS are utilized for live-scan or rolled/slap prints while only a few systems can work on latent fingerprints with reasonable accuracy. The question of whether taking higher resolution scans of latent fingerprints and their rolled/slap mate prints could help improve the identification accuracy still remains an open question in the forensic community. Because pores are one of the most reliable features besides minutiae to identify latent fingerprints. we propose an end-to-end automatic pore extraction and matching system to analyze the utility of pores in latent fingerprint identification. Hence. this paper answers two questions in the latent fingerprint domain:(i) does the incorporation of pores as level-3 features improve the system performance significantly? and (ii) does the 1.000 ppi image resolution improve the recognition results? We believe that our proposed end-to-end pore extraction and matching system will be a concrete baseline for future latent AFIS development.,True,i6wx2AEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,7,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11472,545454876305922242,/scholar?cites=545454876305922242,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11472,0,0,0

While feasible. digital attacks have limited applicability in attacking deployed systems. including face recognition systems. where an adversary typically has access to the input and not the transmission channel. In such setting. physical attacks that directly provide a malicious input through the input channel pose a bigger threat. We investigate the feasibility of conducting real-time physical attacks on face recognition systems using adversarial light projections. A setup comprising a commercially available web camera and a projector is used to conduct the attack. The adversary uses a transformation-invariant adversarial pattern generation method to generate a digital adversarial pattern using a one or more images of the target available to the adversary. The digital adversarial pattern is then projected onto the adversary's face in the physical domain to either impersonate a target (impersonation) or evade recognition (obfuscation). We conduct preliminary experiments using two open-source and one commercial face recognition system on a pool of 50 subjects.

Some of these variations may not be included in the training data. which means that the models have a risk to not generalize well. Addressing such variations and evaluating them in reproducible scenarios allows understanding of when the models generalize better. which is crucial for performance improvements and better DCNN models. Staining normalization techniques and color augmentation approaches have shown improvements in the generalization of the classification tasks for several tissue types. Domain-invariant training of DCNN's is also a promising technique to address the problem of training a single model for different domains. since it includes the source domain information to guide the training towards domain-invariant features. achieving state-of-the-art results in classification tasks. In this article. deep domain adaptation in convolutional networks (DANN) is applied to computational pathology and compared with widely used staining normalization and color augmentation methods in two challenging classification tasks. The classification tasks rely on two openly accessible datasets. targeting Gleason grading in prostate cancer and mitosis classification in breast tissue.

The ever-increasing cybersecurity threats faced by today’s digital systems require a strong cyber-defense mechanism that is both reactive in its response to mitigate the known risk and proactive in being prepared for handling the unknown risks. In order to be proactive for handling the unknown risks. the above workforce must be scheduled dynamically so the system is adaptive to meet the day-to-day stochastic demands on its workforce (both size and expertise mix). The stochastic demands on the workforce stem from the varying alert generation and their significance rate. which causes an uncertainty for the cybersecurity analyst scheduler that is attempting to schedule analysts for work and allocate sensors to …,True,V5e7PHkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,36,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2882969,738634522805238118,/scholar?cites=738634522805238118,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2882969,0,0,0

Analysts work in shifts. and the goal at the end of each shift is to ensure that all alerts from each sensor (client) are analyzed. The goal is often not met because the CSOC is faced with adverse conditions such as variations in alert generation rates or in the time taken to thoroughly analyze new alerts. Current practice at many CSOCs is to pre-assign analysts to sensors based on their expertise. and the alerts from the sensors are triaged. queued. and presented to analysts.

The remote inference scheme that executes the DNNs on the server-class or cloud backend can address the above two challenges. However. it brings the concern of leaking the privacy of the IoT devices’ users to the curious backend since the user-generated/related data is to be transmitted to the backend.

A unified architecture for joint vehicle detection and motion segmentation is introduced. In this architecture. a two-stream encoder is shared among both tasks. In order to evaluate our method in autonomous driving setting. KITTI annotated sequences with detection and odometry ground truth are used to automatically generate static/dynamic annotations on the vehicles. This dataset is called KITTI Moving Object Detection dataset (KITTI MOD). The dataset will be made publicly available to act as a benchmark for the motion detection task. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state of the art methods that utilize motion cue only with 21.5% in mAP on KITTI MOD. Our method performs on par with the state of the art unsupervised methods on DAVIS benchmark for generic object segmentation. One of our interesting conclusions is that joint training of motion segmentation and vehicle detection benefits motion segmentation. Motion segmentation has relatively fewer data. unlike the detection task. However. the shared fusion encoder benefits from joint training to learn a generalized representation.

Laser scanner sensors (LiDAR. Light Detection And Ranging) became a fundamental choice due to its long-range and robustness to low light driving conditions. The problem of designing a control software for self-driving cars is a complex task to explicitly formulate in rule-based systems. thus recent approaches rely on machine learning that can learn those rules from data. The major problem with such approaches is that the amount of training data required for generalizing a machine learning model is big. and on the other hand LiDAR data annotation is very costly compared to other car sensors.

In the last few decades. the deployment of center pivot irrigation systems has increased dramatically throughout the United States. Monitoring the installment and operation of the center pivot systems can help:(i) Water resource management agencies to objectively assess water consumption and properly allocate water resources.(ii) Agro-businesses to locate potential customers. and (iii) Researchers to investigate land use change.

Although popular computer vision datasets like Cityscapes. MS-COCO. PASCAL provide good benchmarks for several tasks (eg image classification. segmentation. object detection). these datasets are hardly suitable for post disaster damage assessments. On the other hand. existing natural disaster datasets include mainly satellite imagery which have low spatial resolution and a high revisit period. Therefore. they do not have a scope to provide quick and efficient damage assessment tasks. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can effortlessly access difficult places during any disaster and collect high resolution imagery that is required for aforementioned tasks of computer vision. To address these issues we present a high resolution UAV imagery. FloodNet. captured after the hurricane Harvey. This dataset demonstrates the post flooded damages of the affected areas. The images are labeled pixel-wise for semantic segmentation task and questions are produced for the task of visual question answering. FloodNet poses several challenges including detection of flooded roads and buildings and distinguishing between natural water and flooded water. With the advancement of deep learning algorithms. we can analyze the impact of any disaster which can make a precise understanding of the affected areas. In this paper. we compare and contrast the performances of baseline methods for image classification. semantic segmentation. and visual question answering on our dataset.,True,8Gcf-GoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02951,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02951,0,0,0

First. a new data driven approach for predicting the Covid-19 pandemic dynamics is introduced. The second contribution consists in reporting and discussing the results that were obtained with this approach for the Brazilian states. with predictions starting as of 4 May 2020. As a preliminary study. we first used an Long Short Term Memory for Data Training-SAE (LSTM-SAE) network model. Although this first approach led to somewhat disappointing results. it served as a good baseline for testing other ANN types. Subsequently. in order to identify relevant countries and regions to be used for training ANN models. we conduct a clustering of the world’s regions where the pandemic is at an advanced stage. This clustering is based on manually engineered features representing a country’s response to the early spread of the pandemic. and the different clusters obtained are used to select the relevant countries for training the models. The final models retained are Modified Auto-Encoder networks. that are trained on these clusters and learn to predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to estimate important statistics about the disease. such as peaks and number of confirmed cases. Finally. curve fitting is carried out to find the distribution that best fits the outputs of the MAE. and to refine the estimates of the peaks of the pandemic. Predicted numbers reach a total of more than one million infected Brazilians. distributed among the different states. with São Paulo leading with about 150 thousand confirmed cases predicted.

However. the specific features extracted. and. by extension. the selected CNN architecture. can have a major impact on the clustering results. In practice. this crucial design choice is often decided arbitrarily due to the impossibility of using cross-validation with unsupervised learning problems. However. information contained in the different pretrained CNN architectures may be complementary. even when pretrained on the same data. To improve clustering performance. we rephrase the image clustering problem as a multi-view clustering (MVC) problem that considers multiple different pretrained feature extractors as different"" views"" of the same data. We then propose a multi-input neural network architecture that is trained end-to-end to solve the MVC problem effectively. Our experimental results. conducted on three different natural image datasets. show that: 1. using multiple pretrained CNNs jointly as feature extractors improves image clustering; 2. using an end-to-end approach improves MVC; and 3. combining both produces state-of-the-art results for the problem of image clustering.",True,gO-31VYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,11,https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07760,11551915732564755376,/scholar?cites=11551915732564755376,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07760,0,0,0

Usually. to decide where to sort an object. the system needs to solve either an instance retrieval (known object) or a supervised classification (predefined set of classes) problem. In this paper. we introduce a new decision making module. where the robotic system chooses how to sort the objects in an unsupervised way. We call this problem Unsupervised Robotic Sorting (URS) and propose an implementation on an industrial robotic system. using deep CNN feature extraction and standard clustering algorithms. We carry out extensive experiments on various standard datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed image clustering pipeline. To evaluate the robustness of our URS implementation. we also introduce a complex real world dataset containing images of objects under various background and lighting conditions. This dataset is used to fine tune the design choices (CNN and clustering algorithm) for URS. Finally. we propose a method combining our pipeline with ensemble clustering to use multiple images of each object.

Such an algorithm was developed to implement a robotics application consisting in sorting and storing objects in an unsupervised way. The toy dataset used to validate such application consists of Lego bricks of different shapes and colors. The uncontrolled lighting conditions together with the use of RGB color features. respectively involve data with a large spread and different levels of measurement between data dimensions. To overcome the combination of these two characteristics in the data. we have developed a new weighted K-means algorithm. called gap-ratio K-means. which consists in weighting each dimension of the feature space before running the K-means algorithm. The weight associated with a feature is proportional to the ratio of the biggest gap between two consecutive data points. and the average of all the other gaps.

Although deep learning has facilitated progress in image understanding. a robot's performance in problems like object recognition often depends on the angle from which the object is observed. Traditionally. robot sorting tasks rely on a fixed top-down view of an object. By changing its viewing angle. a robot can select a more semantically informative view leading to better performance for object recognition. In this paper. we introduce the problem of semantic view selection. which seeks to find good camera poses to gain semantic knowledge about an observed object.

Due to their large scale in presence. computer based image analysis is used to facilitate such analysis with improved analysis efficiency and reproducibility. To ensure the quality of downstream biomedical analyses. it is essential to segment clustered nuclei with high quality. However. this presents a technical challenge commonly encountered in a large number of biomedical research. as nuclei are often overlapped due to a high cell density.

1287034,Job rotation: effects on muscular activity variability,2017,Andres C Rodriguez and Lope H Barrero,60,,,83-92,Elsevier,Job rotation strategies have been used for years as an administrative intervention to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The benefits of job rotation have been hypothesized to occur via changes in muscular activity variability (MAV). However. the effect of job rotation on MAV has not been fully analyzed in a literature review. A wide search was conducted to identify studies testing the effect of different job rotation strategies on MAV. Twenty-six studies of acceptable quality were included. Several studies on different types of tasks supported the view that job rotation can increase muscular activity variability. particularly with strategies such as alternating tasks and pace changes. However. it remains uncertain whether such variability changes immediately translate into benefits for the worker because little evidence was found that showed simultaneous changes in different muscular groups. Additionally. variability …,True,8KKPgc8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,18,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687016302496,12768066303301911026,/scholar?cites=12768066303301911026,,,,0,0,0
1287035,Counting the uncountable: deep semantic density estimation from Space,2018,Andres C Rodriguez and Jan D Wegner,,,,351-362,Springer. Cham,We propose a new method to count objects of specific categories that are significantly smaller than the ground sampling distance of a satellite image. This task is hard due to the cluttered nature of scenes where different object categories occur. Target objects can be partially occluded. vary in appearance within the same class and look alike to different categories. Since traditional object detection is infeasible due to the small size of objects with respect to the pixel size. we cast object counting as a density estimation problem. To distinguish objects of different classes. our approach combines density estimation with semantic segmentation in an end-to-end learnable convolutional neural network (CNN). Experiments show that deep semantic density estimation can robustly count objects of various classes in cluttered scenes. Experiments also suggest that we need specific CNN architectures in remote sensing …,True,8KKPgc8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,9,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-12939-2_24,1487422029539788514,/scholar?cites=1487422029539788514,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07091,0,0,0

Our main motivation is recognition of animal species for ecological applications like biodiversity modelling. which can be challenging due to long-tailed species distributions due to rare species. and strong dataset biases in repetitive scenes such as in camera traps. To counteract these challenges. we propose a weakly-supervised visual attention mechanism that has access to keypoints highlighting the most important object parts. This privileged information. implemented via a novel privileged pooling operation. is only accessible during training and helps the model to focus on the regions that are most discriminative.

Methods: WMSDs were identified from the 1992-2014 Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses conducted by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Risk of WMSDs was measured by number of WMSDs per 10.000 full-time equivalent workers (FTEs). FTEs were calculated from the Current Population Survey. The risk of WMSDs was stratified by major demographic and employment subgroups. Time series analysis was performed to examine the trend of WMSDs in construction over time. Results: From 1992 to 2014. the number of WMSDs significantly dropped in construction industry. following the overall injury trends. However. the rate of WMSDs in construction remained higher than in all industries combined. and the median of days away from work extended. At the same time. the proportion of WMSDs for construction workers 55 and older significantly increased from single-digit to double-digit. reflecting the aging workforce in construction. The rate of WMSDs for Hispanic construction workers was lower than their white. non-Hispanic counterparts. suggesting injury underreporting among Hispanic workers. By occupation. helpers. heating and air-conditioning mechanics. and cement masons had the highest rates of WMSDs. In addition. more than 40% of WMSDs in construction were back injuries.

1287053,On the comparison of wearable sensor data fusion to a single sensor machine learning technique in fall detection,2018,Panagiotis Tsinganos and Athanassios Skodras,18,Sensors,2,592,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In the context of the ageing global population. researchers and scientists have tried to find solutions to many challenges faced by older people. Falls. the leading cause of injury among elderly. are usually severe enough to require immediate medical attention; thus. their detection is of primary importance. To this effect. many fall detection systems that utilize wearable and ambient sensors have been proposed. In this study. we compare three newly proposed data fusion schemes that have been applied in human activity recognition and fall detection. Furthermore. these algorithms are compared to our recent work regarding fall detection in which only one type of sensor is used. The results show that fusion algorithms differ in their performance. whereas a machine learning strategy should be preferred. In conclusion. the methods presented and the comparison of their performance provide useful insights into the problem of fall detection.

This particular combination finds many applications. including sign language recognition. robotic equipment control. virtual reality gaming. and prosthetics control [1]. Among the various sensor modalities that have been used to capture hand gesture information. electromyography (EMG) is considered more appropriate since it captures the muscle’s electrical activity; the physical phenomenon that results in hand gestures. EMG data can be recorded either with invasive or non-invasive methods.

A common problem regularly encountered in literature is the inadequate data availability. Data augmentation. which aims at generating new synthetic data from the existing ones. is the most common approach to deal with this data shortage in other research domains. In the case of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. there is limited research in augmentation methods and quite regularly the results differ between available studies. In this work. we provide a detailed evaluation of existing (ie. additive noise. overlapping windows) and novel (ie. magnitude warping. wavelet decomposition. synthetic sEMG models) strategies of data augmentation for electromyography signals. A set of metrics (ie. classification accuracy. silhouette score. and Davies–Bouldin index) and visualizations help with the assessment and provides insights about their performance. Methods like signal magnitude warping and wavelet decomposition yield considerable increase (up to 16%) in classification accuracy across two benchmark datasets.

Most existing methods for graph similarity focus either on local or on global properties of graphs. However. even if graphs seem very similar from a local or a global perspective. they may exhibit different structure at different scales. In this paper. we present a general framework for graph similarity which takes into account structure at multiple different scales. The proposed framework capitalizes on the wellknown k-core decomposition of graphs in order to build a hierarchy of nested subgraphs. We apply the framework to derive variants of four graph kernels. namely graphlet kernel. shortest-path kernel. Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel. and pyramid match graph kernel. The framework is not limited to graph kernels. but can be applied to any graph comparison algorithm. The proposed framework is evaluated on several benchmark datasets for graph classification. In most cases. the corebased kernels achieve significant improvements in terms of classification accuracy over the base kernels. while their time complexity remains very attractive.,True,e8sOVRcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,38,http://www.tensorinfinity.com/upload/files/20181227/1545889245470344.pdf,2042589865209707438,/scholar?cites=2042589865209707438,,,http://www.tensorinfinity.com/upload/files/20181227/1545889245470344.pdf,0,0,0

Capitalizing on the fact that neural networks inherently constitute multipartite graphs among neuron layers. we aim to analyze directly their structure to extract meaningful information that can improve the learning process. To our knowledge graph mining techniques for enhancing learning in neural networks have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper we propose an adapted version of the k-core structure for the complete weighted multipartite graph extracted from a deep learning architecture. As a multipartite graph is a combination of bipartite graphs. that are in turn the incidence graphs of hypergraphs. we design k-hypercore decomposition. the hypergraph analogue of k-core degeneracy. We applied k-hypercore to several neural network architectures. more specifically to convolutional neural networks and multilayer perceptrons for image recognition tasks after a very short pretraining. Then we used the information provided by the hypercore numbers of the neurons to re-initialize the weights of the neural network. thus biasing the gradient optimization scheme.

In this paper. we propose a novel template-free approach called G2Gs by transforming a target molecular graph into a set of reactant molecular graphs. G2Gs first splits the target molecular graph into a set of synthons by identifying the reaction centers. and then translates the synthons to the final reactant graphs via a variational graph translation framework.

Existing work focuses on developing neural models to generate either molecular sequences or chemical graphs. However. it remains a big challenge to find novel and diverse compounds satisfying several properties. In this paper. we propose MARS. a method for multi-objective drug molecule discovery. MARS is based on the idea of generating the chemical candidates by iteratively editing fragments of molecular graphs. To search for high-quality candidates. it employs Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) on molecules with an annealing scheme and an adaptive proposal. To further improve sample efficiency. MARS uses a graph neural network (GNN) to represent and select candidate edits. where the GNN is trained on-the-fly with samples from MCMC. Experiments show that MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-objective settings where molecular bio-activity. drug-likeness. and synthesizability are considered.

Collaborative recommendation with heterogeneous explicit feedbacks (CR-HEF) such as 5-star grade scores and like/dislike binary ratings is a new and important problem. because it provides a rich and accurate source for learning users’ preferences. However. most previous works on collaborative recommendation only focus on exploiting homogeneous explicit feedbacks such as grade scores or homogeneous implicit feedbacks such as clicks or purchases.

For decision-making research that requires human data. high-quality datasets serve as important benchmarks to facilitate the development of new methods by providing a common reproducible standard. Many human decision-making tasks require visual attention to obtain high levels of performance. Therefore. measuring eye movements can provide a rich source of information about the strategies that humans use to solve decision-making tasks. Here. we provide a large-scale. high-quality dataset of human actions with simultaneously recorded eye movements while humans play Atari video games. The dataset consists of 117 hours of gameplay data from a diverse set of 20 games. with 8 million action demonstrations and 328 million gaze samples. We introduce a novel form of gameplay. in which the human plays in a semi-frame-by-frame manner. This leads to near-optimal game decisions and game scores that are comparable or better than known human records. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset through two simple applications: predicting human gaze and imitating human demonstrated actions. The quality of the data leads to promising results in both tasks. Moreover. using a learned human gaze model to inform imitation learning leads to an 115% increase in game performance.

The existing fixed-length fingerprint feature extraction methods either suffer from redundant feature magnitude or lack of template security. In this letter. we present a compact (128 bytes) and cancelable fingerprint binary codes generation scheme which enables accurate and efficient comparison as well as high security. This binary representation is also available for advanced encryption schemes (e.g. fuzzy commitment). Specifically. a kernel learning-based real-valued fingerprint feature is converted into compact and cancelable binary code via one permutation hashing.

Unfortunately. such characteristic of unordered and variable-sized minutiae information causes a restriction on the operation in some advanced template protection methods (e.g. fuzzy commitment). which usually require an ordered and fixed-length binary feature representation as the system input. In this study. in order to simultaneously extend the application of fingerprint recognition and provide satisfactory system performance. the authors propose a novel fixed-length bit-string conversion framework based on spectral clustering and the proposed newly designed discriminative fingerprint representation called minutia vicinity combined feature (MVCF).

1287136,3D-CNN-based fused feature maps with LSTM applied to action recognition,2019,Sheeraz Arif and Jing Wang and Tehseen Ul Hassan and Zesong Fei,11,Future Internet,2,42,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Human activity recognition is an active field of research in computer vision with numerous applications. Recently. deep convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks (RNN) have received increasing attention in multimedia studies. and have yielded state-of-the-art results. In this research work. we propose a new framework which intelligently combines 3D-CNN and LSTM networks. First. we integrate discriminative information from a video into a map called a ‘motion map’by using a deep 3-dimensional convolutional network (C3D). A motion map and the next video frame can be integrated into a new motion map. and this technique can be trained by increasing the training video length iteratively; then. the final acquired network can be used for generating the motion map of the whole video. Next. a linear weighted fusion scheme is used to fuse the network feature maps into spatio-temporal features. Finally. we use a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder for final predictions. This method is simple to implement and retains discriminative and dynamic information. The improved results on benchmark public datasets prove the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.

1287139,Interference management in femtocells by the adaptive network sensing power control technique,2018,Tehseen Ul Hassan and Fei Gao and Babur Jalal and Sheeraz Arif,10,Future Internet,3,25,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The overlay integration of low-power femtocells over macrocells in a heterogeneous network (HetNet) plays an important role in dealing with the increasing demand of spectral efficiency. coverage and higher data rates. at a nominal cost to network operators. However. the downlink (DL) transmission power of an inadequately deployed femtocell causes inter-cell interference (ICI). which leads to severe degradation and sometimes link failure for nearby macrocell users. In this paper. we propose an adaptive network sensing (ANS) technique for downlink power control to obviate the ICI. The simulation results have shown that the ANS power control technique successfully decreases the cell-edge macro user’s interference and enhances the throughput performance of macro users. while also optimizing the coverage and capacity of the femtocell. When compared with the Femto User Equipment (FUE)-assisted and Macro User Equipment (MUE)-assisted power control technique. the proposed technique offers a good tradeoff in reducing interference to macro users. while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the femtocell users.

1287140,Video Representation via Fusion of Static and Motion Features Applied to Human Activity Recognition.,2019,Sheeraz Arif and Jing Wang and Zesong Fei and Fida Hussain,13,KSII Transactions on Internet & Information Systems,7,,,In human activity recognition system both static and motion information play crucial role for efficient and competitive results. Most of the existing methods are insufficient to extract video features and unable to investigate the level of contribution of both (Static and Motion) components. Our work highlights this problem and proposes Static-Motion fused features descriptor (SMFD). which intelligently leverages both static and motion features in the form of descriptor. First. static features are learned by two-stream 3D convolutional neural network. Second. trajectories are extracted by tracking key points and only those trajectories have been selected which are located in central region of the original video frame in order to to reduce irrelevant background trajectories as well computational complexity. Then. shape and motion descriptors are obtained along with key points by using SIFT flow. Next. cholesky transformation is introduced to fuse static and motion feature vectors to guarantee the equal contribution of all descriptors. Finally. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is utilized to discover long-term temporal dependencies and final prediction. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. extensive experiments have been conducted on three well-known datasets ie UCF101. HMDB51 and YouTube.

The co-prime array interpolation approach can detect O (MN) paths with O (M+ N) sensors in the array. However. the presence of missing elements (holes) in the difference coarray has limited the number of DOFs. To implement co-prime coarray on subspace based DOA estimation algorithm namely multiple signal classification (MUSIC). a reshaping operation followed by the spatial smoothing technique have been presented in the literature. In this paper. an active coarray interpolation (ACI) is proposed to efficiently recovering the covariance matrix of the augmented coarray from the original covariance matrix of source signals with no vectorizing and spatial smoothing operation; thus. the computational complexity reduces significantly. Moreover. the numerical simulations of the proposed ACI approach offers better performance compared to its counterparts.

The core driver of the model uses Biot's theory of poroelasticity. The model uses a time-dependent analysis that accounts for the poroelastic effects of pore pressure and deviatoric stress. which are not accounted for in the common static linear elasticity analyses. The use of pseudo-3D FEM based on the theory of generalized plane strain. allows the freedom to analyze complex geometries such as inclined boreholes in anisotropic formation under three dimensional stress field.

1287157,Risk-controlled wellbore stability analysis in anisotropic formations,2015,Majed F Kanfar and Z Chen and SS Rahman,134,Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,,214-222,Elsevier,The paper presents a semi-analytical solution for the stability of inclined boreholes drilled in isotropic and anisotropic formations. Conventional analytical or semi-analytical models are designed to yield no borehole collapse failure along the borehole wall. However. in deep wells. where there are high hoop stresses acting on the borehole wall. it is difficult to apply the safe mud weight produced by these ubiquitous models. The proposed solution in this work imposes a constraint on how much failure will occur along the borehole wall. This risk-controlled stability analysis will produce a safe mud window that can be realistically achieved during drilling operations. Analytical solutions for stress distribution for isotropic and anisotropic rocks are presented. In addition. a solution for the upper limit for the mud window to prevent tensile failure is developed.

Elastic anisotropy plays a major role in the estimation of local stresses. especially in the perturbed region around the borehole.

It has been attracting interests in both theoretical and empirical studies. However. most of the recent developments are limited to the simplified single-layered networks. Multiplex social networks are social networks with multiple layers where the same set of nodes appear in different layers. Consequently. a single attack can trigger simultaneous propagation in all corresponding layers. Therefore. suppressing propagation in multiplex topologies is more challenging given the fact that each layer also has a different structure. In this paper. we address the problem of suppressing the epidemic propagation in multiplex social networks by allocating protection resources throughout different layers. Given a multiplex graph. such as a social network. and k budget of protection resources. we aim to protect a set of nodes such that the percentage of survived nodes at the end of epidemics is maximized. We propose MultiplexShield. which employs the role of graph spectral properties. degree centrality and layer-wise stochastic propagation rate to pre-emptively select k nodes for protection. We also comprehensively evaluate our proposal in two different approaches: multiplex-based and layer-based node protection schemes. Furthermore. two kinds of common attacks are also evaluated: random and targeted attack.

Suppressing the epidemic spreading in such networks is quite challenging. The problem of protecting a limited number of nodes to restrain the spreading of malicious attacks or dangerous rumor in the networks is called graph protection problem. However. most of existing strategies only consider to protect at once regardless the evolving network structure and incoming attacks over time. i.e.. these strategies either pre-protect important nodes before the epidemic starts or post-allocate the protection while the attacks have already spread over the network. In this paper. we introduce multiple-turns protection strategies. which divide the size of protection budget into several turns and protect nodes according to the currently observed temporal snapshot of dynamic networks. We construct a minimum vertex cover of the input network efficiently using reinforcement learning approach. To capture the state of the input network. a feature-based representation of each node is constructed using a graph embedding technique. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed methods. namely ReProtect and ReProtect-p effectively restrain epidemic propagation in synthetic and real-world network datasets.

Moreover. the existing protection schemes are limited to the simplified pre-emptive and post-emptive schemes.

Lately. 3D HPR is widely performed using a depth imaging sensor. but this approach has limitations: 1) orientations of body parts cannot be accurately recognized and 2) it suffers from occlusion. To achieve an accurate and stable recognition of human poses in real-time. in this study. we propose to use inertial measurement units (IMUs) which are used to estimate the orientation of body limbs and solve the occlusion problem. Via fusion of depth and IMU sensors. our results demonstrate significantly improved 3D human pose reconstruction: our results show the accurate recognition of twist and location of the arms even under occlusion.

Using techniques from modern differential geometry. we derive relationships between the curvature of the isophotes and the shape operator for the surface.

To answer this question. we created a synthetic image set that prevents sole reliance on either low-level visual features or high-level context for the detection of target objects. Rendered images consist of smoothly varying. globally aligned contour fragments (amoebas) distributed among groups of randomly rotated fragments (clutter). The time course and accuracy of amoeba detection by humans was measured using a two-alternative forced choice protocol with self-reported confidence and variable image presentation time (20-200 ms). followed by an image mask optimized so as to interrupt visual processing. Measured psychometric functions were well fit by sigmoidal functions with exponential time constants of 30-91 ms. depending on amoeba complexity. Key aspects of the psychophysical experiments were accounted for by a computational network model. in which simulated responses across retinotopic arrays of orientation-selective elements were modulated by cortical association fields. represented as multiplicative kernels computed from the differences in pairwise edge statistics between target and distractor images. Comparing the experimental and the computational results suggests that each iteration of the lateral interactions takes at least  ms of cortical processing time.

Differences across individuals are minimal near certain configurations such as ridges and boundaries. and it is these configurations that are often represented in line drawings. In particular. we introduce a method for inferring a qualitative three-dimensional shape from shading patterns that link the shape-from-shading inference with shape-from-contour inference. For a given shape. certain shading patches approach “line drawings” in a well-defined limit. Under this limit. and invariably with respect to rendering choices. these shading patterns provide a qualitative description of the surface.

First. depending on the rendering physics. images can change significantly with (even) small changes in lighting or viewpoint. while the percept frequently does not. Second. brightness variations can be induced by material effects—such as pigmentation—as well as by shading effects. Improperly interpreted. material effects would confound shading effects. We show how these dilemmas are coupled by reviewing recent developments in shape inference together with a role for colour in separating material from shading effects. Aspects of both are represented in a common geometric (flow) framework. and novel displays of hue/shape interaction demonstrate a global effect with interactions limited to localized regions. Not all parts of an image are perceptually equal; shape percepts appear to be constructed from image anchor regions.,True,JPZWLKQAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,11,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0019,3525044598165528785,/scholar?cites=3525044598165528785,,,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0019,0,0,0

Motivated by neurobiology. we introduce the shading flow field (the tangent map to the image isophotes) between the image and the surface levels.

However. these two types of flows provide fundamentally different information about surface structure. Texture flows. when derived from distinct elements. mainly signal first-order features (surface slant). whereas shading flow orientations primarily relate to second-order surface properties. It is therefore crucial for the brain to identify whether flow patterns originate from shading or texture to correctly infer shape. One possible approach would be to use'surface appearance'(eg smooth gradients vs. fine-scale texture) to distinguish texture from shading. However. the structure of the flow fields themselves may indicate whether a given flow is more likely due to first-or second-order shape information. Here we test these two possibilities.

We have previously shown that orientation flows produced by the various cues provide fundamentally different information about shape. leading to complementary strengths and weaknesses (see Cholewiak & Fleming.

Here we sought to predict specific regions of interest (ROIs) within shapes where the different cues lead to better or worse shape perception. Since the predictions were derived from the orientation flows. our analysis provides a key test of how and when the visual system uses orientation flows to estimate shape.

Though multi-view structure-from-motion could build 3D maps. it is not robust in textureless environments. Some learning based methods exploit human demonstration to predict a steering command directly from a single image. However. this method is usually biased towards certain tasks or demonstration scenarios and also biased by human understanding. In this paper. we propose a new method to predict a trajectory from images. We train our system on more diverse NYUv2 dataset. The ground truth trajectory is computed from the designed cost functions automatically. The Convolutional Neural Network perception is divided into two stages: first. predict depth map and surface normal from RGB images. which are two important geometric properties related to 3D obstacle representation. Second. predict the trajectory from the depth and normal. Results show that our intermediate perception increases the accuracy by 20% than the direct prediction. Our model generalizes well to other public indoor datasets and is also demonstrated for robot flights in simulation and experiments.,True,7MI2vokAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,35,https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08759,13946695934730882456,/scholar?cites=13946695934730882456,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08759,0,0,0

Carnegie Mellon University,In this thesis. we investigate vision-based techniques to support robot mobile autonomy in human environments. including also understanding the important image features with respect to a classification task. Given this wide goal of transparent vision-based autonomy. the work proceeds along three main fronts. Our first algorithm enables a UAV to visually localize and navigate with respect to CoBot. a ground mobile robot. in order to perform visual search tasks. Our approach leverages the robust localization and navigation capabilities of CoBot while allowing the UAV to search for the object of interest in locations that CoBot cannot access. Second. to enable safe UAV navigation using its monocular camera. we contribute a deep learning based perception system to avoid obstacles in real-time. We demonstrate that using our system. UAVs can navigate safely in various challenging environments. Finally. we address our goal towards justification of vision-based decisions.

However. running deep learning models on mobile devices is generally challenging due to limitation of the available computing resources. It is common to let the users send their service requests to cloud servers that run the large-scale deep learning models to process. Sending the data associated with the service requests to the cloud. however. impose risks on the user data privacy. Some prior arts proposed sending the features extracted from raw data (eg. images) to the cloud. Unfortunately. these extracted features can still be exploited by attackers to recover raw images and to infer embedded private attributes (eg. age. gender. etc.). In this paper. we propose an adversarial training framework DeepObfuscator that can prevent extracted features from being utilized to reconstruct raw images and infer private attributes. while retaining the useful information for the intended cloud service (ie. image classification). DeepObfuscator includes a learnable encoder. namely. obfuscator that is designed to hide privacy-related sensitive information from the features by performingour proposed adversarial training algorithm. Our experiments on CelebAdataset show that the quality of the reconstructed images fromthe obfuscated features of the raw image is dramatically decreased from 0.9458 to 0.3175 in terms of multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM). The person in the reconstructed image. hence. becomes hardly to be re-identified.

1287226,Mobieye: An efficient cloud-based video detection system for real-time mobile applications,2019,Jiachen Mao and Qing Yang and Ang Li and Hai Li and Yiran Chen,,,,1-6,,In recent years. machine learning research has largely shifted focus from the cloud to the edge. While the resulting algorithm-and hardware-level optimizations have enabled local execution for the majority of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices. the sheer magnitude of DNNs associated with real-time video detection workloads has forced them to remain relegated to remote execution in the cloud. This problematic when combined with the strict latency requirements that are coupled with these workloads. and imposes a unique set of challenges not directly addressed in prior works. In this work. we design MobiEye. a cloud-based video detection system optimized for deployment in real-time mobile applications. MobiEye is able to achieve up to a 32% reduction in latency when compared to a conventional implementation of video detection system with only a marginal reduction in accuracy.,True,JVKSaWIAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,7,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3316781.3317865,8459162217804021459,/scholar?cites=8459162217804021459,,,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10097296,0,0,0
1287227,Privacy-Preserving Multiparty Learning For Logistic Regression,2018,Wei Du and Ang Li and Qinghua Li,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02400,,,,In recent years. machine learning techniques are widely used in numerous applications. such as weather forecast. financial data analysis. spam filtering. and medical prediction. In the meantime. massive data generated from multiple sources further improve the performance of machine learning tools. However. data sharing from multiple sources brings privacy issues for those sources since sensitive information may be leaked in this process. In this paper. we propose a framework enabling multiple parties to collaboratively and accurately train a learning model over distributed datasets while guaranteeing the privacy of data sources.

1287228,Lotteryfl: Personalized and communication-efficient federated learning with lottery ticket hypothesis on non-iid datasets,2020,Ang Li and Jingwei Sun and Binghui Wang and Lin Duan and Sicheng Li and Yiran Chen and Hai Li,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.03371,,,,Federated learning is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm with enhanced privacy. Its primary goal is learning a global model that offers good performance for the participants as many as possible. The technology is rapidly advancing with many unsolved challenges. among which statistical heterogeneity (ie. non-IID) and communication efficiency are two critical ones that hinder the development of federated learning. In this work. we propose LotteryFL--a personalized and communication-efficient federated learning framework via exploiting the Lottery Ticket hypothesis. In LotteryFL. each client learns a lottery ticket network (ie. a subnetwork of the base model) by applying the Lottery Ticket hypothesis. and only these lottery networks will be communicated between the server and clients. Rather than learning a shared global model in classic federated learning. each client learns a personalized model via LotteryFL; the communication cost can be significantly reduced due to the compact size of lottery networks. To support the training and evaluation of our framework. we construct non-IID datasets based on MNIST. CIFAR-10 and EMNIST by taking feature distribution skew. label distribution skew and quantity skew into consideration. Experiments on these non-IID datasets demonstrate that LotteryFL significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of personalization and communication cost.,True,JVKSaWIAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,6,https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03371,5538302767268235791,/scholar?cites=5538302767268235791,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03371,0,0,0
1287229,PhotoSafer: content-based and context-aware private photo protection for smartphones,2018,Ang Li and David Darling and Qinghua Li,,,,10-18,IEEE,Nowadays many people store photos in smartphones. Many of the photos contain sensitive. private information. such as a photocopy of driver's license and credit card. An arising privacy concern is with the unauthorized accesses to such private photos by installed apps. The Android permission system offers all-or-nothing access to photos stored on smartphones. which is still coarse-grained control and makes users unaware of the exact behavior of installed apps. Our analysis found that 82% of the top 200 free apps have complete access to stored photos and network on a user's smartphone. In addition. our user survey revealed that 87.5% of 112 respondents are not aware that certain apps can access their photos without informing users. and all the respondents believe that the stored photos on their smartphones contain different types of private information.

1287230,Politecamera: Respecting strangers’ privacy in mobile photographing,2018,Ang Li and Wei Du and Qinghua Li,,,,227-247,Springer. Cham,Camera is a standard on-board sensor of modern mobile phones. It makes photo taking popular due to its convenience and high resolution. However. when users take a photo of a scenery. a building or a target person. a stranger may also be unintentionally captured in the photo. Such photos expose the location and activity of strangers. and hence may breach their privacy. In this paper. we propose a cooperative mobile photographing scheme called PoliteCamera to protect strangers’ privacy. Through the cooperation between a photographer and a stranger. the stranger’s face in a photo can be automatically blurred upon his request when the photo is taken. Since multiple strangers nearby the photographer might send out blurring requests but not all of them are in the photo. an adapted balanced convolutional neural network (ABCNN) is proposed to determine whether the requesting stranger is in the …,True,JVKSaWIAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-01701-9_13,15634747219211055504,/scholar?cites=15634747219211055504,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11634,0,0,0
1287231,Privacy-preserving outsourcing of large-scale nonlinear programming to the cloud,2018,Ang Li and Wei Du and Qinghua Li,,,,569-587,Springer. Cham,The increasing massive data generated by various sources has given birth to big data analytics. Solving large-scale nonlinear programming problems (NLPs) is one important big data analytics task that has applications in many domains such as transport and logistics. However. NLPs are usually too computationally expensive for resource-constrained users. Fortunately. cloud computing provides an alternative and economical service for resource-constrained users to outsource their computation tasks to the cloud. However. one major concern with outsourcing NLPs is the leakage of user’s private information contained in NLP formulations and results. Although much work has been done on privacy-preserving outsourcing of computation tasks. little attention has been paid to NLPs. In this paper. we for the first time investigate secure outsourcing of general large-scale NLPs with nonlinear constraints.

The hand gestures are detected using the inertial sensors present in wearable devices. Existing sensor based gesture detection algorithms have limitations which prevent its use in smart wearable devices and smart phones.
