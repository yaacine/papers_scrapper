Principal Findings We herein use single-cysteine mutagenesis technique to investigate conformational changes in TM helices of rhodopsin upon photoactivation. Specifically. we study changes in accessibility and reactivity of cysteine residues introduced into the TM helix-III of rhodopsin. Twenty-eight single-cysteine mutants of rhodopsin (P107C-R135C) were prepared after substitution of all natural cysteine residues (C140/C167/C185/C222/C264/C316) by alanine.

Protein phosphorylation is believed to play a key role in regulating auxin-mediated responses. To determine the phosphoproteins affected by auxin in Arabidopsis. we used phospho-specific antibodies to analyze their profiles on two-dimensional gels. then identified them by mass spectrometry. We found two phosphoproteins. enolase and the beta subunit of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS-beta). and noted that their phosphorylation was increased by auxin. To investigate their importance in auxin-mediated processes. we characterized Arabidopsis knockout mutants of the two genes.

Reactivation of the p53 by small molecules has emerged as a promising new strategy for cancer therapy. Several classes of small-molecules that activate the p53 pathway have been discovered using various approaches. Here. we identified harmine (β-carboline alkaloid) as a novel activator of p53 signaling involved in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth. Harmine induced p53 phosphorylation and disrupted the p53-MDM2 interaction. Harmine also prevented p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide and activated nuclear accumulation of p53 followed by increasing its transcriptional activity in endothelial cells. Moreover. harmine not only induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. but also suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay. Finally. harmine inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor angiogenesis. as demonstrated by a xenograft tumor model.

1212483,Modulating DDAH/NOS pathway to discover vasoprotective insulin sensitizers,2016,Li Lai and Yohannes T Ghebremariam,2016,,,,Hindawi,Insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) is a configuration of cardiovascular risk factors involved in the development of metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to diet. age. socioeconomic. and environmental factors. genetic factors that impair insulin signaling are centrally involved in the development and exacerbation of IRS. Genetic and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that the nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) genes are critically involved in the regulation of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. The generation of NO by the NOS enzymes is known to contribute to vascular homeostasis including insulin-mediated skeletal muscle vasodilation and insulin sensitivity. By contrast. excessive inhibition of NOS enzymes by exogenous or endogenous factors is associated with insulin resistance (IR). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous molecule that competitively inhibits all the NOS enzymes and contributes to metabolic perturbations including IR. The concentration of ADMA in plasma and tissue is enzymatically regulated by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). a widely expressed enzyme in the cardiovascular system. In preclinical studies. overexpression of DDAH has been shown to reduce ADMA levels. improve vascular compliance. and increase insulin sensitivity.

It is time consuming and costly to determine DTI experimentally. Hence. it is necessary to develop computational methods for the prediction of potential DTI. Based on complex network theory. three supervised inference methods were developed here to predict DTI and used for drug repositioning. namely drug-based similarity inference (DBSI). target-based similarity inference (TBSI) and network-based inference (NBI). Among them. NBI performed best on four benchmark data sets. Then a drug-target network was created with NBI based on 12.483 FDA-approved and experimental drug-target binary links. and some new DTIs were further predicted. In vitro assays confirmed that five old drugs. namely montelukast. diclofenac. simvastatin. ketoconazole. and itraconazole. showed polypharmacological features on estrogen receptors or dipeptidyl peptidase-IV with half maximal inhibitory or effective concentration ranged from 0.2 to 10 µM.

Efforts to elucidate the cancer progression reveal the importance of bone metastasis for tumor malignancy. one of the leading causes for high mortality rate. Multiple cancers develop bone metastasis. from which breast cancers exhibit the highest rate and have been well recognized. Numerous cells and environmental factors have been believed to synergistically facilitate bone metastasis in breast cancers. from which breast cancer cells. osteoclasts. osteoblasts and their produced cytokines have been well recognized to form a vicious cycle that aggravates tumor malignancy. Except the cytokines or chemokines. calcium ions are another element largely released from bones during bone metastasis that leads to hypercalcemia. however. have not been well characterized yet in modulation of bone metastasis. Calcium ions act as a type of unique second messenger that exhibits omnipotent functions in numerous cells. including tumor cells. osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Calcium ions cannot be produced in the cells and are dynamically fluxed among extracellular calcium pools. intracellular calcium storages and cytosolic calcium signals. namely calcium homeostasis. raising a possibility that calcium ions released from bone during bone metastasis would further enhance bone metastasis and aggravate tumor progression via the vicious cycle due to abnormal calcium homeostasis in breast cancer cells. osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

However. whether β-arrestin 2 has any effect on the function of Mdm2 is still unclear. Our current results demonstrated that the binding of Mdm2 to β-arrestin 2 was significantly enhanced by stimulation of GPCRs. Activation of GPCRs led to formation of a ternary complex of Mdm2. β-arrestin 2. and GPCRs and thus recruited Mdm2 to GPCRs at plasma membrane. Moreover. the binding of β-arrestin 2 to Mdm2 suppressed the self-ubiquitination of Mdm2 and consequently reduced the Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation and ubiquitination.

The E3 ligase WWP2 specifically interacts with K119-methylated Sox2 through its HECT domain to promote Sox2 ubiquitination. In contrast. AKT1 phosphorylates Sox2 at T118 and stabilizes Sox2 by antagonizing K119me by Set7 and vice versa. In mouse ESCs.

Ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation is one of the main ways in which cells control c-Myc abundance at a post-translational level. However. the underlying mechanism by which c-Myc is directly deubiquitinated is not fully understood. In this study. by screening ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) that may regulate c-Myc stability. we identified USP37 as a novel deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that stabilizes c-Myc via direct binding.

We found that men with prostate cancers expressing high levels of the G protein–coupled receptor LGR4 had a significantly shorter recurrence-free survival compared with patients with cancers having low LGR4 expression. LGR4 expression was elevated in human prostate cancer cell lines with metastatic potential. We therefore generated a novel transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model to investigate the role of Lgr4 in prostate cancer development and metastasis in vivo. TRAMP Lgr4−/− mice exhibited an initial delay in prostate intraepithelial neoplasia formation. but the frequency of tumor formation was equivalent between TRAMP and TRAMP Lgr4−/− mice by 12 weeks.

How these cells modulate spermatogenesis and the signaling pathways that are involved are largely unknown.

In this study. we identified a nucleolar protein called PAK1IP1 as another regulator of this loop. PAK1IP1 was induced when cells were treated with chemicals that disturb ribosome biogenesis. Overexpression of PAK1IP1 inhibited cell proliferation by inducing p53-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest. PAK1IP1 bound to MDM2 and inhibited its ability to ubiquitinate and to degrade p53. consequently leading to the accumulation of p53 levels. Interestingly. knockdown of PAK1IP1 in cells also inhibited cell proliferation and induced p53-dependent G1 arrest. Deficiency of PAK1IP1 increased free ribosomal protein L5 and L11 which were required for PAK1IP1 depletion-induced p53 activation.

We evaluated the influence of NCTD on host defense against invaded pathogens by acute peritonitis mouse model. ELISA. Q-PCR. nitrite quantification. phagocytosis assay and gelatin zymography assay. Our data showed that the survival and the serum concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-α were all enhanced by NCTD significantly in peritonitis mouse model. Accordingly. LPS-induced cytokine. nitric oxide and MMP-9 production as well as the phagocytosis of bacteria were all up-regulated by NCTD in a dose dependent manner in both RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs).

Experimental models of congenital Zika syndrome identified neural progenitor cells as a target of viral infection. Neural progenitor cells are responsible for populating the developing central nervous system with neurons and glia. Neural progenitor dysfunction can lead to severe birth defects. namely. lissencephaly. microcephaly. and cognitive deficits. For this study. the consequences of ZIKV infection in human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor (hNP) cells and neurons were evaluated. ZIKV isolates from Asian and African lineages displayed lineage-specific replication kinetics. cytopathic effects. and impacts on hNP function and neuronal differentiation. The currently circulating ZIKV isolates exhibit a unique profile of virulence. cytopathic effect. and impaired cellular functions that likely contribute to the pathological mechanism of congenital Zika syndrome. The authors found that infection with Asian-lineage ZIKV isolates impaired the proliferation and migration of hNP cells. and neuron maturation. In contrast. the African-lineage infections resulted in abrupt and extensive cell death. This work furthers the understanding of ZIKV-induced brain pathology.

Currently. developmental neurotoxicity testing relies heavily on neurobehavioral and neuropathological studies in rodent models; however. an existing backlog of chemicals lack appropriate neurotoxicity information due to the low throughput nature and subsequent high cost of in vivo animal testing. Alternative models have been developed to replace rodent models (including non-mammalian models. brain slice culture. and primary and transformed cell models) though limitations to increasing throughput and reproducibility remain. In this review. we focus on the use of human pluripotent stem cells as a cell source for in vitro chemical screening. Pluripotent stem cell-based assays are derived from a virtually unlimited and uniform cell source making studies highly reproducible and relatively low cost compared to rodent models. Moreover. directed differentiation to distinct neural lineages. including neurons and astrocytes. provides isogenic. precise and tunable cell mixtures to mimic in vivo brain composition for high throughput screening. Thus. human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural models are poised to vastly increase throughput and decrease costs for developmental neurotoxicity screening.,True,TPkT2ykAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC,0,https://www.pediatricsresearchjournal.com/articles/modeling-human-pregnancyassociated-developmental-neurotoxicity-in-vitro-using-pluripotent-stem-cellderived-neurons-and-astrocytes.html,,,,https://www.pediatricsresearchjournal.com/articles/modeling-human-pregnancyassociated-developmental-neurotoxicity-in-vitro-using-pluripotent-stem-cellderived-neurons-and-astrocytes.html,0,0,0

This study took place in four ambulatory care clinics at a large urban medical center. All clinics received standard ROR training. Two of the four clinics received additional ROR training and bookmarks with age-specific advice about reading aloud with children. Following the intervention. medical providers reported no behavioral differences. however caregivers in the intervention group reported: more frequent trips to the library. receiving more books from their pediatrician. and receiving more advice on how to read with their child than caregivers in from the comparison clinics.

Here. we investigated the protein-coding capacities and the expression levels of their isoforms for human known genes. the conservation and disease association of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with two transcriptome sequencing datasets from human brain tissues and 10 mixed cell lines. Comparative analysis revealed that about two-thirds of the genes expressed between brain and cell lines are the same. but less than one-third of their isoforms are identical. Besides those genes specially expressed in brain and cell lines. about 66% of genes expressed in common encoded different isoforms. Moreover. most genes dominantly expressed one isoform and some genes only generated protein-coding (or noncoding) RNAs in one sample but not in another. We found 282 human genes could encode both protein-coding and noncoding RNAs through alternative splicing in the two samples. We also identified more than 1.000 long ncRNAs. and most of those long ncRNAs contain conserved elements across either 46 vertebrates or 33 placental mammals or 10 primates. Further analysis showed that some long ncRNAs differentially expressed in human breast cancer or lung cancer. several of those differentially expressed long ncRNAs were validated by RT-PCR. In addition. those validated differentially expressed long ncRNAs were found significantly correlated with certain breast cancer or lung cancer related genes. indicating the important biological relevance between long ncRNAs and human cancers.

The cDNA of hieiPN is 5743 bp long. encoding a protein product of 634 amino acids containing a BTB domain. The protein is highly conserved across different species. Western blot analysis indicates that the KLHL31 protein is abundantly expressed in both embryonic skeletal and heart tissue. In COS-7 cells.

We examined the cytokine profile of the eyelid lesions. measured the behavioral response. and documented the treatment response to topical steroids.Results.: Our results show that Stat6VT mice spontaneously developed blepharitis. keratitis. and uveitis similar to that observed in patients with AD. Histologic findings of allergic inflammation in affected eyelids in this model include the presence of a lymphocyte-predominant infiltrate and tissue eosinophilia in the dermis.

To investigate the mechanism of this induction. the viability of lens epithelial cells in calcimycin (calcium ionophore. A23187)-treated rat lenses were examined. During incubation of lenses with 5μm calcimycin. apoptotic epithelial cells were found after a 2-hr treatment as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) labeling. The percentage of apoptotic cells quickly rose as the incubation time increased. After a 12-hr incubation. more than 60% of the lens epithelial cells underwent apoptosis. Prolonged c-fos expression. previously shown to be an indicator of programmed cell death. was also observed during this treatment.

According to a recent statistical analysis. a total of 1479350 new cancer cases and 562340 deaths from cancer occurred in the United States in 2009 [1]. Unlike heart disease. death rates for cancer remained approximately the same in the United States from 1975 through 2002. Indeed. it is predicted that by 2020 approximately 15 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed worldwide and 12 million cancer patients will die [2]. One of the most important findings to have emerged during the past three decades is that cancer is a preventable disease. Thus. people need to be educated about the risk factors for cancer and those that prevent the disease. As many as 90% of all cancers have been shown to be due to environmental/acquired factors such as tobacco. diet. radiation. and infectious organisms. etc.. and only the remaining 5–10% of cases are caused by internal factors such as inherited mutations. hormones. and immune conditions [3]. A strong link between diet and cancer is indicated by the large variation in incidence rates of specific cancers and the observed changes in the incidence of cancer in migrating populations.

In addition. these treatments are often toxic and expensive. thus new agents which are safe. affordable and effective are urgently needed. We describe here the results of our study with acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA). an agent obtained from an Ayurvedic medicine. gum resin of Boswellia serrata. Whether AKBA has an activity against human PaCa. was examined in in vitro models and in an orthotopic nude mouse model of PaCa. We found that AKBA inhibited the proliferation of four different PaCa cell lines (AsPC-1. PANC-28. and MIA PaCa-2 with K-Ras and p53 mutations. and BxPC-3 with wild-type K-Ras and p53 mutation). These effects correlated with an inhibition of constitutively active NF-κB and suppression of NF-κB regulating gene expression. AKBA also induced apoptosis. and sensitized the cells to apoptotic effects of gemcitabine. In the orthotopic nude mouse model of PaCa. p.o. administration of AKBA alone (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the tumor growth; this activity was enhanced by gemcitabine. In addition. AKBA inhibited the metastasis of the PaCa to spleen. liver. and lungs. This correlated with decreases in Ki-67. a biomarker of proliferation. and CD31. a biomarker of microvessel density. in the tumor tissue.

According to a recent statistical analysis. a total of 1479350 new cancer cases and 562340 deaths from cancer occurred in the United States in 2009 [1]. Unlike heart disease. death rates for cancer remained approximately the same in the United States from 1975 through 2002. Indeed. it is predicted that by 2020 approximately 15 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed worldwide and 12 million cancer patients will die [2]. One of the most important findings to have emerged during the past three decades is that cancer is a preventable disease. Thus. people need to be educated about the risk factors for cancer and those that prevent the disease. As many as 90% of all cancers have been shown to be due to environmental/acquired factors such as tobacco. diet. radiation. and infectious organisms. etc.. and only the remaining 5–10% of cases are caused by internal factors such as inherited mutations. hormones. and immune conditions [3]. A strong link between diet and cancer is indicated by the large variation in incidence rates of specific cancers and the observed changes in the incidence of cancer in migrating populations. For example. Ho [4] showed that although the Chinese in Shanghai will have a cancer incidence of 2 cases per 100000 population. among those who migrate to the United States. the incidence increases to 23 per 100000 within 5 years.

Available anti-cancer drugs exhibit limited efficacy. associated with severe side effects. and are also expensive. Thus identification of pharmacological agents that do not have these disadvantages is required. Curcumin. a polyphenolic compound derived from turmeric (Curcumin longa). is one such agent that has been extensively studied over the last three to four decades for its potential anti-inflammatory and/or anti-cancer effects. Curcumin has been found to suppress initiation. progression. and metastasis of a variety of tumors. These anti-cancer effects are predominantly mediated through its negative regulation of various transcription factors. growth factors. inflammatory cytokines. protein kinases. and other oncogenic molecules. It also abrogates proliferation of cancer cells by arresting them at different phases of the cell cycle and/or by inducing their apoptosis. The current review focuses on the diverse molecular targets modulated by curcumin that contribute to its efficacy against various human cancers.

The Mdm2C305F/C305F mice. although phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) mice when fed normal chow. demonstrated decreased fat accumulation along with improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance after prolonged HFD feeding. We found that HFD increases expression of c-MYC and RPL11 in both WT and Mdm2C305F/C305F mice; however. p53 was induced in WT but not in Mdm2C305F/C305F mice.

Although the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) results from enhanced mitochondrial respiration during stimulation with glucose and other fuels. the expression of antioxidant defense genes is unusually low (or disallowed) in beta cells.Critical …,True,uJ6oNRUAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C,260,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ars.2016.6755,1871991037581114371,/scholar?cites=1871991037581114371,,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ars.2016.6755,0,0,0

Our proposal is that the MPT occurs as a result of the binding of mitochondrial cyclophilin (CyP-D) to the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This binding is enhanced by thiol modification of the ANT caused by oxidative stress or other thiol reagents. CyP-D binding enhances the ability of the ANT to undergo a conformational change triggered by Ca2+. Binding of ADP or ATP to a matrix site of the ANT antagonises this effect of Ca2+; modification of other ANT thiol groups inhibits ADP binding and sensitises the MPT to [Ca2+]. Increased membrane potential changes the ANT conformation to enhance ATP binding and hence inhibit the MPT.

A key feature of the transition from reversible to irreversible injury is mitochondrial dysfunction which may involve the opening of a non-specific pore in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Pore opening can be induced in vitro by exposure of isolated mitochondria to high [Ca2+] and Pi. Such pore formation is sensitized by adenine nucleotide depletion and oxidative stress and can be blocked by the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A.

This review summarizes the recent evidence obtained in the liver that defines the roles of these products as intracellular messengers of hormone action. Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is mediated by IP3. which releases Ca2+ from a subpopulation of the endoplasmic reticulum. resulting in a rapid increase of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i).

To understand how mitochondria integrate the [Ca 2+] c signals into a final metabolic response. we stimulated hepatocytes with high vasopressin doses that generate a sustained increase in [Ca 2+] c. This elicited a synchronous. single spike of [Ca 2+] m and consequent NAD (P) H formation. which could be related to changes in the activity state of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) measured in parallel.

Mitochondria appear in close association with regions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enriched in IP3R and are particularly responsive to IP3-induced increases of cytosolic Ca2+([Ca2+]c). To determine whether feedback regulation of the IP3R by released Ca2+ is modulated by mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. the interactions between ER and mitochondrial Ca2+ pools were examined by fluorescence imaging of compartmentalized Ca2+ indicators in permeabilized hepatocytes.

Addition of a maximal concentration of vasopressin (100 nM) to hepatocytes prelabeled with 32 P resulted in decreases of TPI and DPI to about 50 and 30%. respectively. which were complete within 15 s. This hormone also caused a rapid decrease of PI. amounting to about 8% of the total PI by 2 min. The activation of phosphorylase by vasopressin was detectable within 5 s. but the elevation of phosphatidic acid (maximally 2-fold at 2 min) was not detectable until after a 5-15 s lag period.

Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) mediates the translocation step of peptide-chain elongation and is inhibited through phosphorylation by eEF2 kinase. In addition. p70S6 kinase can regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating eEF2 kinase or via phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. We have recently shown that eEF2 kinase is also controlled by phosphorylation by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis. Moreover. the mammalian target of rapamycin has also been shown to be inhibited. indirectly. by AMPK. thus leading to the inhibition of p70S6 kinase.

An important regulator of energy supply and demand in eukaryotic cells is the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The rate of peptide chain elongation can be modulated through the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2. which inhibits its activity and is catalyzed by a specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase termed eEF2 kinase. Here we show that AMPK directly phosphorylates eEF2 kinase. and we identify the major site of phosphorylation as Ser-398 in a regulatory domain of eEF2 kinase. AMPK also phosphorylates two other sites (Ser-78 and Ser-366) in eEF2 kinase in vitro.

Here we identify the phosphorylation site in eIF2Bϵ as Ser540 and show that treatment of eIF2B with GSK-3 inhibits its activity. Ser540 is phosphorylated in intact cells and undergoes dephosphorylation in response to insulin. This is blocked by PI 3-kinase inhibitors.

One such substrate is the ε-subunit of rat eukaryotic protein-synthesis initiation factor 2B (eIF2Bε). which is inhibited by the GSK3-catalysed phosphorylation of Ser535.

Addressing the therapeutic potential of modulating mTORC1 signaling and autophagy in human disease requires active chemicals with pharmacologically desirable properties.  Methodology/Principal Findings Using an automated cell-based assay. we screened a collection of >3.500 chemicals and identified three approved drugs (perhexiline. niclosamide. amiodarone) and one pharmacological reagent (rottlerin) capable of rapidly increasing autophagosome content. Biochemical assays showed that the four compounds stimulate autophagy and inhibit mTORC1 signaling in cells maintained in nutrient-rich conditions. The compounds did not inhibit mTORC2. which also contains mTOR as a catalytic subunit. suggesting that they do not inhibit mTOR catalytic activity but rather inhibit signaling to mTORC1. mTORC1 inhibition and autophagosome accumulation induced by perhexiline. niclosamide or rottlerin were rapidly reversed upon drug withdrawal whereas amiodarone inhibited mTORC1 essentially irreversibly. TSC2. a negative regulator of mTORC1. was required for inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rottlerin but not for mTORC1 inhibition by perhexiline. niclosamide and amiodarone.

We report that eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K). which is activated by AMP-kinase (AMPK). confers cell survival under acute nutrient depletion by blocking translation elongation.

Recent studies have shown that expression of inactive mutants of PKR in cultured cells causes them to acquire characteristics typical of transformed cells. These and other findings indicate that PKR plays a role in the normal control of cell growth and differentiation. It seems likely that. in addition to elF-2.

Subsequent recruitment of several components. including the small ribosomal subunit. is thought to allow migration of initiation complexes and recognition of the initiation codon. Mitogens and cytokines stimulate the phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser209. but the functional consequences of this modification have remained a major unresolved question. Using fluorescence spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance techniques. we show that phosphorylation of eIF4E markedly reduces its affinity for capped RNA. primarily due to an increased rate of dissociation.

1212943,Molecular mechanisms for the control of translation by insulin,1997,G Christopher PROUD and M Richard DENTON,328,,2,329-341,Portland Press,Insulin acutely stimulates protein synthesis in mammalian cells. and this involves activation of the process of mRNA translation. mRNA translation is a complex multi-step process mediated by proteins termed translation factors. Several translation factors are regulated in response to insulin. often as a consequence of changes in their states of phosphorylation. The initiation factor eIF4E binds to the cap structure at the 5ʹ-end of the mRNA and mediates assembly of an initiation-factor complex termed eIF4F. Assembly of this complex can be regulated by eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). which inhibit eIF4F complex assembly. Insulin induces phosphorylation of the 4E-BPs. resulting in alleviation of the inhibition.

These factors are carried in the mesenteric lymph and reach the systemic circulation via the mesenteric lymph. thereby ultimately resulting in distant organ injury.

The balance between glucose storage and mobilization is primarily regulated by the counteracting effects of insulin and glucagon. However. numerous signals converge in the liver to ensure energy demand matches the physiological status of the organism. Many circulating hormones regulate glycogenolysis. gluconeogenesis and mitochondrial metabolism by calcium-dependent signaling mechanisms that manifest as cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations. Stimulus-strength is encoded in the Ca2+ oscillation frequency. and also by the range of intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation in the intact liver. In this article. we describe how Ca2+ oscillations and waves can regulate glucose output and oxidative metabolism in the intact liver; how multiple stimuli are decoded though Ca2+ signaling at the organ level. and the implications of Ca …,True,QLhfLJEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,49,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143416014000293,9251237901995109435,/scholar?cites=9251237901995109435,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Larry_Gaspers/publication/260840136_Calcium-dependent_regulation_of_glucose_homeostasis_in_the_liver/links/5accde6c4585154f3f3f3c6b/Calcium-dependent-regulation-of-glucose-homeostasis-in-the-liver.pdf,0,0,0

It is challenging to discriminate these alternatives. because IP3 fluctuations could drive Ca2+ oscillations or could just be a secondary response to the [Ca2+]i spikes. To investigate this problem. we constructed a recombinant IP3 buffer using type-I IP3 receptor ligand-binding domain fused to GFP (GFP-LBD). which buffers IP3 in the physiological range. This IP3 buffer slows hormone-induced [IP3] dynamics without changing steady-state [IP3].

We report here that the fructose metabolite d-glyceraldehyde (d-GA) is a good inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in isolated rat liver mitochondria. We propose that a substantial portion of the protective effect of fructose on hepatocytes is due to d-GA inhibition of the permeability transition. Aldehydes which are substrates of the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (mALDH) afford protection. while poor substrates do not. Protection is prevented by the ALDH inhibitor chloral hydrate.

In hippocampal slices. we report that stimulation of Schaffer collaterals evokes in CA1 neurons delayed inward currents with slow kinetics. in addition to fast excitatory postsynaptic currents. Similar slow events also occur spontaneously. can still be observed when neuronal activity and synaptic glutamate release are blocked. and are found to be mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes acting preferentially on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. The slow currents can be triggered by stimuli that evoke Ca2+ oscillations in astrocytes. including photolysis of caged Ca2+ in single astrocytes.

As a consequence. the concept is emerging that the recruitment of specific intracellular targets and effector system mechanisms depends on exposure to local [Ca2+] that differs substantially from the mean [Ca2+]. A striking example is provided by mitochondria. intracellular organelles that have been overlooked for a long time in the field of calcium signalling due to the low affinity of their Ca2+-uptake pathways. We will summarize here some of the evidence indicating that these organelles actively participate in Ca2+ homeostasis in physiological conditions (with consequences not only for the control of their function. but also for the modulation of the complexity of calcium signals …,True,QxFEhQwAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,191,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.471.461&rep=rep1&type=pdf,6148352731607984752,/scholar?cites=6148352731607984752,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.471.461&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1213044,Calcium signalling: a historical account. recent developments and future perspectives,2000,M Brini and E Carafoli,57,,3,354-370,Birkhäuser Verlag, Ca2+ is a uniquely important messenger that penetrates into cells through gated channels to transmit signals to a large number of enzymes. The evolutionary choice of Ca2+ was dictated by its unusual chemical properties. which permit its reversible complexation by specific proteins in the presence of much larger amounts of other potentially competing cations. The decoding of the Ca2+ signal consists in two conformational changes of the complexing proteins. of which calmodulin is the most important. The first occurs when Ca2+ is bound. the second (a collapse of the elongated protein) when interaction with the targeted enzymes occurs. Soluble proteins such as calmodulin contribute to the buffering of cell Ca2+. but membrane intrinsic transporting proteins are more important. Ca2+ is transported across the plasma membrane (channel. a pump. a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger) and across the membrane of the …,True,QxFEhQwAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,189,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/PL00000698,12486850307172079913,/scholar?cites=12486850307172079913,,,0,0,0

Transcriptional changes in the components of the phosphatidylinositol cycle and in the receptors for myo-inositol trisphosphate-linked agonists have been found in the cells and in the striatum of the parent Huntington disease mouse. The overall result of the changes is to delay myo-inositol trisphosphate production and to decrease basal Ca2+ in mutant cells. When tested directly. mitochondria in mutant cells behave nearly normally. but are unable to handle large Ca2+ loads. This appears to be due to the increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the permeability transition pore. which dissipates the membrane potential. prompting the release of accumulated Ca2+.

We investigated whether mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis. a key parameter in cell physiology. could be a target for DJ-1 action. Here. we show that DJ-1 modulates mitochondrial Ca2+ transients induced upon cell stimulation with an 1.4.5-inositol-tris-phosphate agonist by favouring the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria tethering.

Numerous studies have established that PINK1 and parkin participate in a common mitochondrial-quality control pathway. promoting the selective degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy. Upregulation of parkin mRNA and protein levels has been proposed as protective mechanism against mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To better understand how parkin could exert protective function we considered the possibility that it could modulate the ER–mitochondria inter-organelles cross talk. To verify this hypothesis we investigated the effects of parkin overexpression on ER–mitochondria crosstalk with respect to the regulation of two key cellular parameters: Ca2 + homeostasis and ATP production.

Behavioural activation has attracted increased interest in recent years. It has been over 5 years since our meta-analyses summarised the evidence supporting and this systematic review updates those findings and examines moderators of treatment effect.  Method Randomised trials of behavioural activation for depression versus controls or anti-depressant medication were identified using electronic database searches. previous reviews and reference lists. Data on symptom level and study level moderators were extracted and analysed using meta-analysis. sub-group analysis and meta-regression respectively.  Results Twenty six randomised controlled trials including 1524 subjects were included in this meta-analysis. A random effects meta-analysis of symptom level post treatment showed behavioural activation to be superior to controls (SMD −0.74 CI −0.91 to −0.56. k = 25. N = 1088) and medication (SMD −0.42 CI −0.83 to-0.00. k = 4. N = 283). Study quality was low in the majority of studies and follow- up time periods short. There was no indication of publication bias and subgroup analysis showed limited association between moderators and effect size.

Ceramide is known to activate both atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) ζ and protein phosphatase (PP) 2A. and each of these effectors has been reported to inhibit PKB. In the present study. palmitate pretreatment was found to elevate PP2A-like activity in myotubes and to prevent its inhibition by insulin.

The elevation of certain intracellular lipid species can lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways that inhibit normal insulin action. Thus. increased diacylglycerol levels in muscle are associated with the activation of one or more isoforms of the protein kinase C family. which is known to attenuate insulin signaling. especially at the level of IRS‐1. In addition. de novo synthesis of ceramide can inhibit more distal sites by the activation of protein phosphatase 2A and hence promote the dephosphorylation and inactivation of protein kinase B.

Isoforms of the protein kinase C (PKC) family have been viewed as candidates for mediating the effects of fat oversupply because they are lipid-dependent kinases with wide-ranging roles in signal transduction. including the positive and negative modulation of insulin action. Until recently. their involvement was based on correlative studies. but now causative roles for distinct PKC isoforms have also been addressed. in both pancreatic β-cells and insulin-sensitive tissues.

Intracellular lipid accumulation contributes to β cell failure through poorly defined mechanisms. Here we report a role for the lipid-regulated protein kinase C isoform PKCɛ in β cell dysfunction. Deletion of PKCɛ augmented insulin secretion and prevented glucose intolerance in fat-fed mice. Importantly. a PKCɛ-inhibitory peptide improved insulin availability and glucose tolerance in db/db mice with preexisting diabetes. Functional ablation of PKCɛ selectively enhanced insulin release ex vivo from diabetic or lipid-pretreated islets and optimized the glucose-regulated lipid partitioning that amplifies the secretory response.

Estimates suggest there are currently 150 million people with diabetes and this number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 95% of all cases and is characterized in part by impaired sensitivity to insulin or 'insulin resistance'. Defects in the insulin signalling pathways underpin this resistance. In the current article we discuss the regulation of Insulin Receptor Substrate‐1 (IRS‐1). a protein that plays a pivotal role in insulin signalling and whose function is impaired in subjects with insulin resistance. Coordination of IRS‐1 function is multi‐faceted. involving phosphorylation of IRS‐1 at multiple serine/threonine residues.

The specific targeting of recombinant GFP within cells would allow it to be used for even more applications. but no information is yet available on the possibility of targeting GFP to intracellular organelles.Results In this study. we show that the GFP cDNA can be expressed at high levels in cultured mammalian cells; the recombinant polypeptide is highly fluorescent and is exclusively localized in the cytosol.

ATPe induced in this cell line two kinds of responses mediated by two different P2 purinergic receptors: 1) an early permeabilization of the plasma membrane to extracellular hydrophilic markers of M(r) up to 900 mediated by P2Z receptors; and 2) a fast mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores mediated by P2Y receptors. Low oATP concentrations (100 microM) completely blocked the first response without affecting the second. ATPe-dependent cell swelling. vacuolization. and lysis were also inhibited. Antagonism developed slowly. as an incubation at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h in the presence of oATP was needed and was irreversible. thus suggesting that the inhibitory action was due to covalent modification of the receptor.

We developed a highly sensitive single muscle fiber proteomics workflow to study human aging and show that the senescence of slow and fast muscle fibers is characterized by diverging metabolic and protein quality control adaptations. Whereas mitochondrial content declines with aging in both fiber types. glycolysis and glycogen metabolism are upregulated in slow but downregulated in fast muscle fibers.

Very recently this nucleotide has been shown to cause cell death by apoptosis. probably by interacting with specific cell-surface receptors. In the present study we have investigated the mechanism of ATPo-dependent cytotoxicity in the macrophage-like mouse cell line J774. It has been previously reported that in this cell type ATPo activates trans-membrane Ca2+ and Na+ fluxes and a drastic increase in the plasma-membrane permeability to hydrophilic solutes smaller than 900 Da. These changes are followed by cell swelling and lysis.

Incomplete coupling is mostly due to a natural leak of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Mitochondrial proton cycling is estimated to cause 20–25% of basal metabolic rate in rats. Proton cycling is equally prominent in hepatocytes from several different mammalian and ectotherm species. so it may be a general pathway of ecologically significant energy loss in all aerobes.

To address this issue. the rate of superoxide production from complex I of rat skeletal muscle mitochondria incubated under a variety of conditions was assessed. By far. the largest rate of superoxide production was from mitochondria respiring on succinate; this rate was almost abolished by rotenone or piericidin. indicating that superoxide production from complex I is large under conditions of reverse electron transport. The high rate of superoxide production by complex I could also be abolished by uncoupler. confirming that superoxide production is sensitive to protonmotive force.

Among these technologies. the Seahorse XF24 Analyzer was designed for use with intact cells attached in a monolayer to a multi-well tissue culture plate. In order to have a high throughput assay system in which both energy demand and substrate availability can be tightly controlled. we have developed a protocol to expand the application of the XF24 Analyzer to include isolated mitochondria. Acquisition of optimal rates requires assay conditions that are unexpectedly distinct from those of conventional polarography.

Sequential measurement of basal. State 3. State 4. and uncoupler-stimulated respiration can be made in each well through additions of reagents from the injection ports.

Catalyzed by OGT and removed by OGA. this dynamic modification is dependent on environmental glucose concentration. O-GlcNAcylation regulates the activities of a wide panel of proteins involved in almost all aspects of cell biology. As a nutrient sensor. O-GlcNAcylation can relay the effects of excessive nutritional intake. an important cancer risk factor. on protein activities and cellular functions. Indeed. O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to play a significant role in cancer development through different mechanisms. O-GlcNAcylation and OGT levels are increased in different cancers (breast. prostate. colon...) and vary during cell cycle progression.

1213182,Molecular basis of insulin action.,1998,M Combettes-Souverain and T Issad,24,,6,477-489,,Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of insulin action. The insulin receptor is a membrane receptor possessing tyrosine kinase activity. The binding of insulin to its receptor induces autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues and thereby stimulates its tyrosine kinase activity towards intracellular substrates such as Shc or IRS1. This tyrosine kinase activity. which plays a crucial role in the transmission of the signal. is decreased in several insulin-resistance situations. This decrease was initially attributed to the phosphorylation of the receptor on serine or threonine residues. but this mechanism is now seriously questioned. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRSs and Shc by the insulin receptor permits the activation of two major signalling pathways. the MAP kinase pathway and the Pl 3-kinase pathway. MAP kinases are involved in proliferation and differentiation processes. in particular by regulating the transcriptional activity of the nucleus. The MAP kinase pathway does not appear to play a significant role in the transmission of the metabolic effects of insulin. In contrast. the Pl 3-kinase pathway is involved in several of the metabolic effects of the hormone. such as glucose transport. glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. The Pl 3-kinase pathway also plays a crucial role in the regulation of protein synthesis by insulin. Moreover. this pathway is involved in cell growth and transmits a strong anti-apoptotic signal.,True,8ggXwy8AAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,143,https://europepmc.org/article/med/9932214,14345621167620544979,/scholar?cites=14345621167620544979,,,0,0,0

This reversible modification depends on the availability of glucose and therefore constitutes a powerful mechanism by which cellular activities are regulated according to the nutritional environment of the cell. O-GlcNAcylation has been implicated in important human pathologies including Alzheimer disease and type-2 diabetes. Only two enzymes. OGT and O-GlcNAcase. control the O-GlcNAc level on proteins.

These dynamic modifications are tightly dependent on the availability of glucose and on its flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. We recently showed that treatments that increase protein O-GlcNAc glycosylation (high-glucose concentrations. glucosamine) or inhibit their deglycosylation (PUGNAc). induced O-GlcNAc modification of FoxO1 in HEK293 cells. O-GlcNAc glycosylation of FoxO1 resulted in an increased of its activity towards a glucose 6-phosphatase promoter–luciferase reporter gene (G6Pase-luc).

Whereas the fetus oxidizes mainly glucose. lactate and aminoacids. the new-born is fed with milk. a high fat. low carbohydrate diet. At weaning. milk is replaced pro-gressively by the adult diet which contains less fat and more carbohydrate. In the hours and days following birth. the newborn adapts itself to the new nutritional environment by increasing its capacity to produce glucose de novo (gluconeogenesis) in order to satisfy its high glucose needs. Oxidation of fatty acids is enhanced in the liver and at the peripheral level.

Fast and slow acting insulin analogues have been developed. but they may have adverse properties. such as increased mitogenic or anti-apoptotic signaling. Insulin/IGF1 hybrid receptors (IR/IGF1R). present in most tissues. have been proposed to transmit biological effects close to those of IGF1R. However. the study of hybrid receptors is difficult because of the presence of IR and IGF1R homodimers. Our objective was to perform the first study on the pharmacological properties of the five marketed insulin analogues towards IR/IGF1R hybrids.   Methodology To study the effect of insulin analogues on IR/IGF1R hybrids. we used our previously developed Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay that permits specific analysis of the pharmacological properties of hybrid receptors. Moreover. we have developed a new. highly sensitive BRET-based assay to monitor phophatidylinositol-3 phosphate (PIP3) production in living cells. Using this assay. we performed a detailed pharmacological analysis of PIP3 production induced by IGF1. insulin and insulin analogues in living breast cancer-derived MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells.   Results Among the five insulin analogues tested. only glargine stimulated IR/IGF1R hybrids with an EC50 that was significantly lower than insulin and close to that of IGF1. Glargine more efficiently stimulated PIP3 production in MCF-7 cells but not in MDA-MB231 cells as compared to insulin.

We now report that mammalian neuraminidase 1 (Neu1). in addition to its catabolic function in lysosomes. is transported to the cell surface where it is involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. Insulin binding to its receptor rapidly induces interaction of the receptor with Neu1. which hydrolyzes sialic acid residues in the glycan chains of the receptor and. consequently. induces its activation. Cells from sialidosis patients with a genetic deficiency of Neu1 show impairment of insulin-induced phosphorylation of downstream protein kinase AKT. and treatment of these cells with purified Neu1 restores signaling.

However. progress in using inhibitors of mTOR signaling as therapeutic agents in oncology has been limited by a number of factors. including the fact that the classic mTOR inhibitor. rapamycin. inhibits only some of the effects of mTOR; the existence of several feedback loops; and the crucial importance of mTOR in normal physiology.,True,jrj7ew8AAAAJ:0izLItjtcgwC,201,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5007757/,12964167521379756609,/scholar?cites=12964167521379756609,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc5007757/,0,0,0

The designs are based on sequence-to-structure relationships both from the literature and analysis of a database of known coiled-coil X-ray crystal structures.

Various sequence-based coiled-coil predictors are available. but key issues remain: oligomeric state and protein–protein interface prediction and extension to all genomes. We present SpiriCoil (http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/spiricoil). which is based on a novel approach to the coiled-coil prediction problem for coiled coils that fall into known superfamilies: hundreds of hidden Markov models representing coiled-coil-containing domain families. Using whole domains gives the advantage that sequences flanking the coiled coils help. SpiriCoil performs at least as well as existing methods at detecting coiled coils and significantly advances the state of the art for oligomer state prediction.

This arginine preference may result from the unique hydration properties of the side chain guanidinium group which facilitates its movement through a hydrophobic plug that seals the center of the VSD. as suggested by molecular dynamics simulations. To test for side chain interactions implicit in this model we inspected interactions of the side chains of arginine and lysine with each of the 19 non-glycine amino acids in proteins in the protein data bank. The arginine guanidinium interacts with non-polar aromatic and aliphatic side chains above and below the guanidinium plane while hydrogen bonding with polar side chains is restricted to in-plane positions. In contrast. non-polar side chains interact largely with the aliphatic part of the lysine side chain.

Here we show that pre-treating human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with synthetic membrane-active myoglobin-polymer–surfactant complexes can provide a reservoir of oxygen capable of alleviating necrosis at the centre of hyaline cartilage. This is achieved through the development of a new cell functionalization methodology based on polymer–surfactant conjugation. which allows the delivery of functional proteins to the hMSC membrane. This new approach circumvents the need for cell surface engineering using protein chimerization or genetic transfection. and we demonstrate that the surface-modified hMSCs retain their ability to proliferate and to undergo multilineage differentiation.

In the present study. the active full-length E1 subunit of the human complex has been expressed and shown to be regulated by Ca2+. adenine nucleotides and NADH. with NADH exerting a major influence on the K0.5 value for Ca2+. We investigated two potential Ca2+-binding sites on E1. which we term site 1 (D114ADLD) and site 2 (E139SDLD).

PDX-1. a major regulator of beta cell identity and function,2001,CM McKinnon and Kevin Docherty,44,,10,1203-1214,Springer-Verlag, Pancreatic duodenal homeobox –1 is a transcription factor that is expressed in beta and δ cells of the islets of Langerhans and in dispersed endocrine cells of the duodenum. It is involved in regulating the expression of a number of key beta-cell genes as well as somatostatin. It also plays a pivotal part in the development of the pancreas and islet cell ontogeny. Thus homozygous disruption of the gene in mice and humans results in pancreatic agenesis. Heterozygous mutations in the gene result in impaired glucose tolerance and symptoms of diabetes as seen in MODY4 and late-onset Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. In adults pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 expression is increased in duct cells of the pancreas that have been induced to proliferate and differentiate to form new islets.

It also regulates the expression of the insulin gene in response to changes in glucose and insulin concentrations. Glucose and insulin regulate PDX-1 by way of a signaling pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and SAPK2/p38. Activation of this pathway leads to phosphorylation of PDX-1 and its movement into the nucleus. To investigate the intracellular trafficking of PDX-1. immunocytochemistry was used to localize PDX-1 in the human β-cell line NesPDX-1. in which PDX-1 is overexpressed. and in MIN6 β-cells.

Studies of insulin receptors on circulating monocytes suggest that the insulin resistance in these patients was due to a marked decrease in insulin binding to its membrane receptors. When these patients were fasted. there was a fall in plasma insulin but no increase in insulin binding. suggesting that the receptor defect was not secondary to the hyperinsulinemia. The clinical features shared by these cases and several similar ones previously reported may be divided into two unique clinical syndromes: Type A. a syndrome in younger females with signs of virilization or accelerated growth. in whom the receptor defect may be primary. and Type B. a syndrome in older females with signs of an immunologic disease. in whom circulating antibodies to the insulin …,True,RAx8zckAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC,1268,https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm197604012941401,3509413884516023281,/scholar?cites=3509413884516023281,,,0,0,0

To determine the contribution of muscle insulin resistance to the metabolic phenotype of diabetes. we used the Cre-loxP system to disrupt the insulin receptor gene in mouse skeletal muscle. The muscle-specific insulin receptor knockout mice exhibit a muscle-specific >95% reduction in receptor content and early signaling events. These mice display elevated fat mass. serum triglycerides. and free fatty acids. but blood glucose. serum insulin. and glucose tolerance are normal.

1213334,Insulin action and the insulin signaling network,1995,Bentley Cheatham and C Ronald Kahn,16,,2,117-142,Oxford University Press,IN THE fasted state. glucose homeostasis depends upon the balance between hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization by the major insulin-dependent tissues. such as liver. adipose. and muscle. and by insulin-independent tissues. such as brain and kidney. This balance is tightly regulated by pancreatic hormones. Thus. in normal individuals. the response to increased plasma glucose levels is an increase in secretion of insulin from β-cells of the pancreatic islets. This increase in circulating insulin levels stimulates glucose transport into peripheral tissues and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. In type II diabetes there are at least two fundamental defects: one is a decrease in the ability of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin (insulin resistance). and the second is impaired β-cell function. which results from long-term hyperglycemia.

In this Seminar we review the pathophysiology of this disorder. with particular attention to epidemiology. genetics. epigenetics. and molecular cell biology. Evidence is emerging that a substantial part of diabetes susceptibility is acquired early in life. probably owing to fetal or neonatal programming via epigenetic phenomena. Maternal and early childhood health might. therefore. be crucial to the development of effective prevention strategies. Diabetes develops because of inadequate islet β-cell and adipose-tissue responses to chronic fuel excess. which results in so-called nutrient spillover. insulin resistance. and metabolic stress.

An increased rate of insulin release is the only efficient means by which the organism can rapidly decrease circulating glucose concentration. By contrast. several neurohormonal factors can promote elevations in blood glucose. Alterations of pancreatic P-cell function result in metabolic disorders that are most often manifested in diabetes mellitus or in hypoglycemic syndromes. D-Glucose is the preeminent regulator of insulin secretion and biosynthesis; it is the only nutrient stimulus that activates the secretory process in vitro at concentrations within the physiological range. However. many additional factors regulate insulin secretion.

In contrast. little is known about the physiological role of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD). an enzyme responsible for malonyl-CoA catabolism. In this study. we examined the effects of voluntary exercise on MCD activity in rat liver. skeletal muscle. and adipose tissue. In addition. the activity ofsn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). which like MCD and ACC can be regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). was assayed. Thirty min after the completion of a treadmill run. MCD activity was increased ∼2-fold. malonyl-CoA levels were reduced. and ACC and GPAT activities were diminished by 50% in muscle and liver.

However. the relative contribution of islet β cells versus non-β cells to glucose-regulated anaplerosis is not known. Furthermore. the fate of glucose carbon entering the Krebs cycle of islet cells remains to be determined. The present study has examined the anaplerosis of glucose carbon in purified rat β cells using specific 14 C-labeled glucose tracers. Between 5 and 20 m m glucose. the oxidative production of CO 2 from [3. 4-14 C] glucose represented close to 100% of the total glucose utilization by the cells. Anaplerosis. quantified as the difference between 14 CO 2 production from [3. 4-14 C] glucose and [6-14 C] glucose. was strongly influenced by glucose. particularly between 5 and 10 m m.

For the pancreatic β-cell. while the presence of some FAs is essential for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. FAs have enormous capacity to amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. which is particularly operative in situations of β-cell compensation for insulin resistance. In this review. we propose that FAs do this via three interdependent processes. which we have assigned to a “trident model” of β-cell lipid signaling. The first two arms of the model implicate intracellular metabolism of FAs. whereas the third is related to membrane free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) activation. The first arm involves the AMP-activated protein kinase/malonyl-CoA/long-chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA) signaling network in which glucose. together with other anaplerotic fuels. increases cytosolic malonyl-CoA. which inhibits FA …,True,lXd578gAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,425,https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/55/Supplement_2/S16.short,7455889476418917652,/scholar?cites=7455889476418917652,,https://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/diabetes/55/Supplement_2/S16.full.pdf,0,0,0

The effect of insulin upon glucose transport and metabolism in soleus muscles of genetically obese (fa/fa) and heterozygote lean Zucker rats was investigated at 5–6 weeks and 10–11 weeks of age.

1213361,Jet energy measurement and its systematic uncertainty in proton–proton collisions at√ s= 7TeV with the ATLAS detector,2015,Melissa Franklin and John Huth and L Jeanty and D Lopez Mateos and Kevin Mercurio and Masahiro Morii and William Spearman and Andy Yen and G Zevi Della Porta,,The European Physical Journal C,,,Springer Nature,The jet energy scale (JES) and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector using proton–proton collision data with a centre-of-mass energy of  s√=7  TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of  4.7   fb −1 . Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits forming topological clusters of calorimeter cells using the anti- kt  algorithm with distance parameters  R=0.4  or  R=0.6 . and are calibrated using MC simulations. A residual JES correction is applied to account for differences between data and MC simulations. This correction and its systematic uncertainty are estimated using a combination of in situ techniques exploiting the transverse momentum balance between a jet and a reference object such as a photon or a  Z  boson. for  20≤pjetT<1000 GeV  and pseudorapidities  |η|<4.5 . The effect of multiple proton–proton interactions is corrected for. and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1 % is found in the central calorimeter region ( |η|<1.2 ) for jets with  55≤pjetT<500 GeV . For central jets at lower  pT . the uncertainty is about 3 %. A consistent JES estimate is found using measurements of the calorimeter response of single hadrons in proton–proton collisions and test-beam data. which also provide the estimate for  pjetT>1  TeV. The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet  pT  balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6 % for low- pT jets at  |η|=4.5 .

Chev.) C.F. Liang and A.R. Ferguson cv. Bruno) at 20 °C. the levels of salicylic acid (SA) in fruit tissues declined. Concurrently. lipoxygenase (LOX) activity increased. and this was associated with climacteric ethylene release. In fruit stored at 0 °C with a reduced rate of softening. SA concentrations remained at relatively high levels. Application of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to ripening kiwifruit resulted in substantially higher SA levels than in control fruit. ASA treatment slowed down the increase in LOX activity and superoxide free radical production. and suppressed ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activities and biosynthesis of ethylene. and hence retarded the climacteric rise in ethylene production. Fruit ripening and senescence were also delayed. A close relationship was found to exist between change in SA levels in the fruit tissues and the …,True,5aWSqbkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,356,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925521402001722,5332945702118070651,/scholar?cites=5332945702118070651,,,0,0,0

However. research at the molecular level is limited by a lack of sequence data. The present study was designed to obtain transcript sequence data and examine gene expression in bayberry developing fruit based on RNA-Seq and bioinformatic analysis. to provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit quality changes during ripening. RNA-Seq generated 1.92 G raw data. which was then de novo assembled into 41.239 UniGenes with a mean length of 531 bp. Approximately 80% of the UniGenes (32.805) were annotated against public protein databases. and coding sequences (CDS) of 31.665 UniGenes were determined. Over 3.600 UniGenes were differentially expressed during fruit ripening. with 826 up-regulated and 1.407 down-regulated. GO comparisons between the UniGenes of these two types and interactive pathways (Ipath) analysis found that energy-related metabolism was enhanced. and catalytic activity was increased. All genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were up-regulated during the fruit ripening processes. concurrent with color change. Important changes in carbohydrate and acid metabolism in the ripening fruit are likely associated with expression of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD).

Tomato plants were transformed with chimaeric genes designed to express anti-PG RNA constitutively. Thirteen transformed lines were obtained of which five were analysed in detail. All contained a single PG antisense gene. the expression of which led to a reduction in PG enzyme activity in ripe fruit to between 5% and 50% that of normal. One line. GR16. showed a reduction to 10% of normal PG activity. The reduction in activity segregated with the PG antisense gene in selfed progeny of GR16.

Both responses involve the synthesis of the hormone ethylene. Accumulation of the pTOM 13-homologous RNA during ripening is rapid and sustained. and reaches its maximum level in orange fruit. Following mechanical wounding of tomato leaves a pTOM 13-homologous RNA shows rapid induction within 30 minutes. which occurs before maximal ethylene evolution (2–3h). This RNA also accumulates following the wounding of green tomato fruit. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA indicates that the length of the mRNA is about 1400 nucleotides.

Both metabolism and perception of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) are important in the initiation and maintenance of dormancy. However. molecular mechanisms that regulate the capacity for dormancy or germination through AR are unknown. To understand the relationship between ABA and AR. we analysed genome expression in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in seed ABA synthesis (aba1‐1) or perception (abi1‐1). Even though imbibed mutant seeds showed no dormancy. they exhibited changes in global gene expression resulting from dry AR that were comparable with changes occurring in wild‐type (WT) seeds.

In allopolyploid plant species biparental or uniparental inheritance of 35S rDNA was demonstrated. Uniparental inheritance; as a result of differential elimination of one of the parental rDNA. can be accompanied by structural rearrangements of rDNA ofthe other parent and by formation of new rDNA variants. Particularly. homo‐genization of rDNA in allopolyploids appears to be an example of fast concerted evolution of repeated sequences.

The Cnr mutation results in colorless fruits with a substantial loss of cell-to-cell adhesion. The nature of the mutation and the identity of the Cnr gene were previously unknown. Using positional cloning and virus-induced gene silencing. here we demonstrate that an SBP-box (SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein–like) gene resides at the Cnr locus. Furthermore. the Cnr phenotype results from a spontaneous epigenetic change in the SBP-box promoter. The discovery that Cnr is an epimutation was unexpected. as very few spontaneous epimutations have been described in plants 3. 4.

This type of intron mobility is referred to as ‘intron homing’. and depends on restriction endonucleases (ENases) encoded by the mobile introns. The ENase cleaves the intron-minus allele near the site of intron insertion. thereby initiating gene conversion. The 23S (LSU) rRNA-encoding gene (LSU) of the chloroplast genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains a self-splicing group-I intron (CrLSU) that has a free-standing open reading frame (ORF) of 163 codons. Translation of CrLSU intron RNA in cell-free systems produces a polypeptide of approx. 18 kDa. the size expected for correct translation of the ORF.

The main aim of the current review is to identify ways of meeting this objective. After reviewing current irrigation practices. discussion is centred on the sensitivity of crops to water deficit. the finding that growth of many crops is unaffected by considerable lowering of soil water content and. on this basis. the creation of improved means of irrigation scheduling. Subsequently. attention is focused on irrigation problems associated with spatial variability in soil water and the often slow infiltration of water into soil. especially the subsoil.

To do this we examined the responses of wild-type (Ailsa Craig) and ABA-deficient mutant (notabilis) genotypes of tomato to a range of salinity (0 (control). 30. 60. 90. 120 mM NaCl). Leaf area was reduced and root:shoot ratio increased in response to increasing salinity in the absence of changes in leaf turgor for both genotypes. Stomatal conductance was however reduced suggesting that a non-hydraulic factor may be coordinating responses to the salinity in the rooting medium. ABA concentrations were increased in response to salinity and correlative analysis showed that stomatal conductance exhibited a negative relationship with increasing xylem ABA for both genotypes (P<0.001).

Low polymorphism at the DNA level conflicts with the wealth of morphological variation. Fruits vary widely in size. shape and colour. In contrast. genetic variation between the 16 wild relatives is tremendous. Several large seed banks provide tomato germplasm for both domesticated and wild accessions of tomato. Recently. the genomes of the inbred cultivar “Heinz 1706” (≈900 Mb) and S. pimpinellifolium (739 Mb) were sequenced. Genomic markers and genome re-sequencing data are available for >150 cultivars and accessions. Transformation of tomato is relatively easy and T-DNA insertion line collections are available. Tomato is widely used as a model crop for fruit development but also for diverse physiological. cellular. biochemical. molecular and genetic studies. It can be easily grown in greenhouses or growth chambers. Plants grow. flower. and develop fruits well at daily light lengths between 8-16 hours. The required daily light integral of an experiment depends on growth stage and temperature investigated. Temperature must be 10-35°C. relative humidity 30-90 % and CO2 concentration 200-1500 µmol mol-1. Temperature determines the speed of the phenological development while daily light integral and CO2 concentration affect photosynthesis and biomass production.

Auxins regulate several fundamental cellular processes including division. elongation and differentiation. Indole–3–acetic acid (IAA). the principal form of auxin in higher plants. is first synthesized within young apical tissues. then conveyed to its basal target tissues by a specialized delivery system termed polar auxin transport. The polarity of IAA movement represents one of the most novel aspect of auxin signalling. IAA transport has been demonstrated to involve auxin influx and efflux carrier activities. The adoption of a mutational approach in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has led to the identification of a number of genes which encode components for. or regulate the activity of. the auxin transport machinery.

The theoretical advantages of incorporating molecular markers into early selection in tree breeding are examined. Equations were derived to answer the following questions:(1) how effective is the use of markers for early selection relative to conventional late (mature) selection?(2) what is the efficiency of using markers for early selection relative to early selection based on morphological traits?(3) how effective is incorporating markers into an early selection index relative to an early selection index based on morphological traits alone?(4) what are the efficiencies when MAS is used only for withinfamily selection in the combined family and within family selection approach. relative to selection using combined family and within family phenotypic information alone? and (5) how effective is selection when MAES is used for within-family selection only in the combined family and within family early selection approach. relative to early selection using combined family and within family phenotypic information alone?

They are important for the resistance of the plant to pest insects. Previously. the biosynthesis of these compounds was shown to be regulated by transcription factors MYB28 and MYB29. We now show that MYB28 and MYB29 are partially redundant. but in the absence of both. the synthesis of all aliphatic glucosinolates is blocked. Untargeted and targeted biochemical analyses of leaf metabolites showed that differences between single and double knock-out mutants and wild type plants were restricted to glucosinolates. Biosynthesis of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates was blocked by the myb28 mutation. while short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were reduced by about 50% in both the myb28 and the myb29 single mutants. Most remarkably. all aliphatic glucosinolates were completely absent in the double mutant. Expression of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes was slightly but significantly reduced by the single myb mutations. while the double mutation resulted in a drastic decrease in expression of these genes. Since the myb28myb29 double mutant is the first Arabidopsis genotype without any aliphatic glucosinolates. we used it to establish the relevance of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis to herbivory by larvae of the lepidopteran insect Mamestra brassicae. Plant damage correlated inversely to the levels of aliphatic glucosinolates observed in those plants: Larval weight gain was 2.6 fold higher on the double myb28myb29 mutant completely lacking aliphatic glucosinolates and 1.8 higher on the single …,True,Vu5T0GkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,239,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002068,6893490703703611765,/scholar?cites=6893490703703611765,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002068,0,0,0

In plants. anthocyanins play a role not only in reproduction. by attracting pollinators and seed dispersers. but also in protection against various abiotic and biotic stresses. There is accumulating evidence that anthocyanins have health-promoting properties. which makes anthocyanin metabolism an interesting target for breeders and researchers. In this review. the state of the art knowledge concerning anthocyanins in the Solanaceous vegetables. i.e. pepper. tomato. eggplant and potato. is discussed. including biochemistry and biological function of anthocyanins. as well as their genetic and environmental regulation. Anthocyanin accumulation is determined by the balance between biosynthesis and degradation. Although the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway has been well studied in Solanaceous vegetables. more research is needed on the inhibition of biosynthesis and. in particular. the anthocyanin degradation mechanisms if we want to control anthocyanin content of Solanaceous vegetables. In addition. anthocyanin metabolism is distinctly affected by environmental conditions. but the molecular regulation of these effects is poorly understood.

The current challenge of basic and applied plant science is to decipher the molecular mechanisms of heat stress response and thermotolerance in detail and use this information to identify genotypes that will withstand unfavorable environmental conditions. Nowadays X-omics approaches complement the findings of previous targeted studies and highlight the complexity of heat stress response mechanisms giving information for so far unrecognized genes. proteins and metabolites as potential key players of thermotolerance. Even more. roles of epigenetic mechanisms and the involvement of small RNAs in thermotolerance are currently emerging and thus open new directions of yet unexplored areas of plant heat stress response. In parallel it is emerging that although the whole plant is vulnerable to heat. specific organs are particularly sensitive to elevated temperatures. This has redirected research from the vegetative to generative tissues. The sexual reproduction phase is considered as the most sensitive to heat and specifically pollen exhibits the highest sensitivity and frequently an elevation of the temperature just a few degrees above the optimum during pollen development can have detrimental effects for crop production.

An unusual predomination of pyridinic nitrogen over graphitic nitrogen has been observed for the CNx nanotubes with reaction temperature below 750 °C. The pyridinic nitrogen decreases and the graphitic nitrogen increases with rising reaction temperature. A synergism mechanism of C5N-six-membered-ring-based growth through surface diffusion and vapor−liquid−solid growth through bulk diffusion was accordingly deduced and schematically presented. This mechanism could not only explain our own experimental results. but also understand the CNx-nanotube-related experimental phenomena in the literature. as well as be in accordance with the basic principle of diffusion kinetics.

In this paper. our goal is to determine the relationship between altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intrinsic functional network connectivity changes in mild AD patients before and after 12-week donepezil treatment. An integrative neuroimaging approach was employed by combining pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) MRI and resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) methods to determine the changes in CBF and functional connectivity (FC) in the cholinergic pathway. Linear regression analyses determined the correlations of the regional CBF alterations and functional connectivity changes with cognitive responses.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,In resting‐state functional MRI studies. the global signal (operationally defined as the global average of resting‐state functional MRI time courses) is often considered a nuisance effect and commonly removed in preprocessing. This global signal regression method can introduce artifacts. such as false anticorrelated resting‐state networks in functional connectivity analyses. Therefore. the efficacy of this technique as a correction tool remains questionable. In this article. we establish that the accuracy of the estimated global signal is determined by the level of global noise (i.e.. non‐neural noise that has a global effect on the resting‐state functional MRI signal). When the global noise level is low. the global signal resembles the resting‐state functional MRI time courses of the largest cluster. but not those of the global noise. Using real data. we demonstrate that the global signal is strongly correlated with the default mode …,True,cuAs-TEAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,79,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.24201,14054239289192990894,/scholar?cites=14054239289192990894,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mrm.24201,0,0,0

However. little is known about the neuropsychological underpinnings of this impaired impulsive control network on drug addiction. Twenty two abstinent heroin dependent (HD) subjects and 15 cognitively normal (CN) subjects participated in this study. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI was employed to measure abnormalities in the intrinsic amygdala functional connectivity (iAFC) network activity and the Barratt Impulsive Scale. 11th version was used to measure impulsivity. Linear regression analysis was applied to detect the neural constructs underlying impulsivity by correlating iAFC network activity with impulsive scores. In the HD group. higher impulsivity scores and significantly enhanced iAFC network activity were found. especially in bilateral thalamus. right insula. and inferior frontal gyrus.

Among the four Cr (VI)-resistant isolates. strain LY6 displayed the highest Cr (VI)-removing ability. with 100 mg/l Cr (VI) being completely removed within 144 h. It could effectively remove Cr (VI) over a wide pH range from 5.5 to 9.5. with the optimal pH of 8.5. The amount of Cr (VI) removed increased with initial Cr (VI) concentration. Data from the time-course analysis of Cr (VI) removal by strain LY6 followed first-order kinetics. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence. strain LY6 was identified as Pseudochrobactrum asaccharolyticum. a species that had never been reported for Cr (VI) removal before. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis further confirmed that strain LY6 could accumulate chromium within the cell while conducting Cr (VI) removal. The results suggested that the indigenous bacterial strain LY6 would be a new candidate for potential application in Cr (VI) pollution bioremediation.,True,cuAs-TEAAAAJ:7q08wCQPkLwC,22,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201331056192153.page,7001130868587376271,/scholar?cites=7001130868587376271,,https://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/JAKO201331056192153.pdf,0,0,0

The gene appears to be almost exclusively expressed in placenta; the protein was found in particular in syncytiotrophoblast. After transfection into various cell types it has proven to be a very fusogenic protein. inducing the formation of syncytia. Therefore. the question rises as to whether syncytin is responsible for the fusion process of villous cytotrophoblast into syncytiotrophoblast in vivo. If so. how is this fusion process regulated if syncytin is found all over the syncytiotrophoblast? Can this process be regulated through local or temporal changes in syncytin expression. or is syncytin merely one factor in a cascade of events leading to fusion limited at some other level?

Although the CpG island within the STOX1 promoter region shows no differential methylation. this study describes the identification of a differentially methylated region (DMR) in intron 1 of the STOX1 gene. Methylation coincides with STOX1 expression. where high methylation leads to reduced expression. In the SGHPL-5 extravillous trophoblast cell line allele-specific expression was observed in a subset of cells.

While its role in extravillous trophoblast (EVT) differentiation has been studied. the involvement in villous trophoblast (VT) differentiation. fatty-acid metabolism. inflammatory responses. and oxidative pathways during pregnancy deserves more attention. PPAR-γ’s potential role in balancing structural development and functional responsibilities at the maternal-fetal interface suggest a more central role for the receptor.

IUGR is associated not only with perinatal morbidity and mortality but also with adult-onset disorders. such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. posing a major health burden. Placental epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as one mechanism that causes IUGR; however. the spectrum of epigenetic pathophysiological mechanisms leading to IUGR remains to be elucidated. Monozygotic monochorionic twins are particularly affected by IUGR. in the setting of severe discordant growth. Because monozygotic twins have the same genotype at conception and a shared maternal environment. they provide an ideal model system for studying epigenetic dysregulation of the placenta. We compared genome-wide placental DNA methylation patterns of severely growth-discordant twins to identify novel candidate genes for IUGR. Snap-frozen placental samples for eight severely growth-discordant monozygotic monochorionic twin pairs were obtained at delivery from each twin. A high-resolution DNA methylation array platform was used to identify methylation differences between IUGR and normal twins. Our analysis revealed differentially methylated regions in the promoters of eight genes: DECR1. ZNF300. DNAJA4. CCL28. LEPR. HSPA1A/L. GSTO1. and GNE.

We identified the suites of genes in the two gene families in Populus and performed comparative genomic analysis with Arabidopsis and rice. A total of 35 Aux/IAA and 39 ARF genes were identified in the Populus genome. Comparative phylogenetic analysis revealed that several Aux/IAA and ARF subgroups have differentially expanded or contracted between the two dicotyledonous plants. Activator ARF genes were found to be two fold-overrepresented in the Populus genome. PoptrIAA and PoptrARF gene families appear to have expanded due to high segmental and low tandem duplication events. Furthermore. expression studies showed that genes in the expanded PoptrIAA3 subgroup display differential expression. The present study examines the extent of conservation and divergence in the structure and evolution of Populus Aux/IAA and ARF gene families with respect to Arabidopsis and rice.

Five primers were selected to amplify a total of 91 polymorphic loci among genotypes. The RAPD markers were scored for presence or absence of bands to generate distance matrices for cluster analysis. Overall similarity was 65% among populations compared to 81% within populations. Blackwell and Caddo were the most similar populations (78%) based on RAPD markers. whereas Alamo and Forestburg were the most …,True,ZA2wCK0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,167,https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci1996.0011183X003600040034x,16978482019560999549,/scholar?cites=16978482019560999549,,,0,0,0
