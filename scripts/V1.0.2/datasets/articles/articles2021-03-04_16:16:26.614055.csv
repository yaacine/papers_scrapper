1141099,Female mate choice for multimodal courtship and the importance of the signaling background for selection on male ornamentation,2013,Jay A Stafstrom and Eileen A Hebets,59,Current Zoology,2,200-209,Oxford University Press,Conspicuous visual ornaments are frequently incorporated into complex courtship displays that integrate signal components from multiple sensory modalities. Mature male Schizocosa crassipes (Walckenaer. 1837) wolf spiders wave. arch. and tap their ornamented forelegs in a visual courtship display that simultaneously incorporates seismic components. To determine the importance of modality-specific signal components in female mate choice. we used a signal ablation design and compared the mating frequency of female-male pairs across signaling environments with manipulated modality-specific transmission properties. We found that the successful transmission of isolated visual or seismic signaling was sufficient for mating success; neither signaling modality was necessary. Additionally. the environment enabling the successful transmission of composite. multimodal displays yielded the highest mating …,True,elY2xBEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,31,https://academic.oup.com/cz/article-abstract/59/2/200/1886248,4194734298539667320,/scholar?cites=4194734298539667320,,https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1059&context=bioscihebets,0,0,0

In the wolf spider Schizocosa stridulans. despite evidence of strong female choice. prior research has been unable to link the conspicuous sexually dimorphic foreleg ornamentation of males to their mating success. We conducted three experiments aimed at determining the function of this previously enigmatic ornamentation. Our first two experiments used males with phenotypically modified foreleg phenotypes in simple and complex mating environments in order to examine the relationship between the presence/absence of ornamentation and male mating success.

This study focuses on one such extreme sensory structure—the posterior median eyes of the net-casting spider Deinopis spinosa. Although past research has implicated the importance of vision in the nocturnal foraging habits of Deinopis. no direct link between vision in the enlarged eyes and nocturnal foraging has yet been made. To directly test the hypothesis that the enlarged posterior median eyes facilitate visually based nocturnal prey capture. we conducted repeated-measures. visual occlusion trials in both natural and laboratory settings.

While intraspecific variation in sensory systems has been documented across distant taxa. fewer studies have investigated how changes in behavior might relate to plasticity in sensory systems across developmental time. To investigate the relationships among behavior. peripheral sensory structures. and central processing regions in the brain. we take advantage of a dramatic within-species shift of behavior in a nocturnal. net-casting spider (Deinopis spinosa). where males cease visually-mediated foraging upon maturation.

Somewhere in the middle are the ogre-faced. net-casting spiders [1] (Deinopidae: Deinopis) that actively capture prey while being suspended within a frame web [2. 3. 4. 5]. Using a net held between their front four legs. these spiders lunge downward to ensnare prey from off the ground beneath them. This “forward strike” is sensorially mediated by a massive pair of hypersensitive. night-vision eyes [5. 6. 7]. Deinopids can also intercept flying insects with a “backward strike.” a ballistically rapid. overhead back-twist. that seems not to rely on visual cues [4. 5. 8].

1141105,Sensory ecology of the net-casting spider Deinopis spinosa,2017,Jay A Stafstrom,,ETD Collect. Univ. Nebraska-Lincoln,,,,Animals rely on sensory systems to gather and process environmental information integral to their success. However beneficial. animals must overcome great energetic costs associated with sensory system development and maintenance. For instance. in the blowfly. Calliphora vicina. 8% of the resting metabolic rate is dedicated to maintaining photoreceptor function (Howard. Blakeslee & Laughlin. 1987). As such. large benefits of possessing such costly vision must be obtained to sustain visual investment at such high levels (Niven & Laughlin. 2008). Investigating the costs and benefits of sensory systems can lead to a better understanding of an animal’s sensory ecology. in turn. illuminating what specific environmental information is most important to an animal’s survival and reproduction. Such information will not only illustrate how sensory systems evolve. but also how selection shapes animals to fit their environmental and behavioral niche. Sensory specialists. animals with high investment in one or two sensory modalities (eg vision or smell). are great examples of how animals have been shaped over evolutionary time to capture specific environmental information. The star-nosed mole. for example. lives a subterranean life with little-to-no sunlight. Over time. these animals have evolved a star-like appendage that is specialized for mechanoreception (ie touch) that allows these animals to detect. handle. and consume invertebrate prey faster than any other land mammal (Catania. 2012). Such specialization comes at the cost of a seemingly less important sensory modality–vision–as their eyes are greatly reduced and they no longer possess …,True,elY2xBEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Stafstrom/publication/317100492_Sensory_Ecology_of_the_Net-Casting_Spider_Deinopis_spinosa/links/599f62844585151e3c6acfd2/Sensory-Ecology-of-the-Net-Casting-Spider-Deinopis-spinosa.pdf,11695800348910213100,/scholar?cites=11695800348910213100,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Stafstrom/publication/317100492_Sensory_Ecology_of_the_Net-Casting_Spider_Deinopis_spinosa/links/599f62844585151e3c6acfd2/Sensory-Ecology-of-the-Net-Casting-Spider-Deinopis-spinosa.pdf,0,0,0

For males. it often involves actively searching for conspecific females. sometimes over great distances. This mate-searching can be aided through chemical or visual signals or cues produced by sexually receptive females. Here. we investigate the roles of olfaction and vision in mate-searching in a strictly nocturnal net-casting spider. Deinopis spinosa. First. we used an olfactometer assay to determine if mature male D. spinosa respond to conspecific airborne cues.

This fundamental change in viewpoint is causing a re-examination of all aspects of the relationship between insects and their environment. This change in perspective is occurring at a time of heightened interest in brain function in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Insects potentially play a major role in this expanding area.

As organisms of economic importance. they are perennial objects of research by both basic and applied scientists. Insect Learning covers both social and non-social insects from multiple perspectives.

1141120,Aposematic coloration. luminance contrast. and the benefits of conspicuousness,2007,Kathleen L Prudic and Ana K Skemp and Daniel R Papaj,18,Behavioral Ecology,1,41-46,Oxford University Press,Many organisms use warning. or aposematic. coloration to signal their unprofitability to potential predators. Aposematically colored prey are highly visually conspicuous. There is considerable empirical support that conspicuousness promotes the effectiveness of the aposematic signal. From these experiments. it is well documented that conspicuous. unprofitable prey are detected sooner and aversion learned faster by the predator as compared with cryptic. unprofitable prey. Predators also retain memory of the aversion longer when prey is conspicuous. The present study focused on the elements of conspicuousness that confer these benefits of aposematic coloration. Drawing on current understanding of animal vision. we distinguish 2 features of warning coloration: high chromatic contrast and high brightness. or luminance. contrast.

Its hypothesized evolutionary relevance has been primarily in the realm of aposematic coloration and limited sexual dimorphism. Here. we develop a novel functional approach to peak shift. based on signal detection theory. which characterizes the response bias as arising from uncertainty about stimulus appearance. frequency. and quality. This approach allows the influence of peak shift to be generalized to the evolution of signals in a variety of domains and sensory modalities. The approach is illustrated with a bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) discrimination learning experiment. Bees exhibited peak shift while foraging in an artificial Batesian mimicry system.

1141125,30 Evolution of Fruit Fly Oviposition Behavior,2001,Francisco Díaz-Fleischer and Daniel R Papaj and Ronald J Prokopy and Allen L Norrbom and Martín Aluja,,,,,,Two general concepts in evolutionary biology have fundamental application to our understanding of the evolution of oviposition behavior in tephritid flies. namely. the concepts of opportunism and key innovation. The first. opportunism. refers to the opportunistic nature of natural selection. Natural selection does not necessarily move organisms along the path that leads to the peak of highest fitness on the adaptive landscape. Rather. natural selection often chooses a relatively expedient path. even if that path does not lead to a theoretically maximum fitness. There are two types of opportunism that we will address in this chapter. The first involves opportunistic use of what the animal itself has available to be modified to serve a particular function. The conversion of the second pair of wings in the Diptera to the halteres. structures that serve a gyroscopic function. is a classic example of morphological opportunism in natural selection. Opportunism can take a less commonly recognized form. involving opportunistic use of what the environment offers to the animal in terms of available niches. For example. with respect to host specialization in insects. a truly spectacular example relates to the evolution of mistletoe feeding in weevils whose relatives feed on the host plants of the parasitic mistletoe (Anderson 1994). This transition from exploitation of a resource to exploitation of something that exploits the resource is a kind of ecological opportunism. Here again. the path that natural selection has taken in modifying the animal may be more expedient than the path to some perhaps more fitness-lucrative. but ecologically less accessible niche.

To optimize the rate of encounters with hosts. these parasitoids are expected to assess the extent to which variation in host–substrate odours is reliably associated with variation in the presence of hosts. that is. substrate profitability. Where the association is reliable. parasitoids should attend to variation in odours and discriminate between them; where it is not. they should ignore it. We hypothesized that foraging decisions are based on the completeness of information the animal has about differences in substrate profitabilities.

In this study. we tested if temporary brood desertion (a) imposes a cost to caring females by increasing the risk of egg predation and (b) offers a benefit to caring females by increasing fecundity as a result of increased foraging opportunities. With intensive field observations followed by a model selection approach. we showed that the proportion of consumed eggs was very low during the day and it was not influenced by the frequency of brood desertion.

Nas ilhas causadas pela fragmentação. as linhas de contato entre os fragmentos de floresta primária e as áreas não florestadas são chamadas de borda (Faaborg et al. 1992). A exposição das bordas do fragmento a condições ambientais distintas daquelas típicas do interior das florestas gera um fenômeno conhecido como efeito de borda (Kapos et al. 1997). Esse efeito é caracterizado por alterações abióticas. como aumento da temperatura. da incidência de luz. da turbulência provocada pelo vento e diminuição da umidade (Laurance 1997). Estes fatores abióticos. por sua vez. provocam alterações bióticas. como aumento na taxa de queda de árvores. extinção de espécies animais e vegetais e invasão por organismos pioneiros (Mesquita et al. 1999). Estas alterações podem ser percebidas até uma distância de 100 m da borda de um fragmento (Kapos 1989).Briófitas são organismos vegetais não vascularizados que não regulam ativamente sua absorção e perda de água (Walter & Stadelmann 1968).

Estes caracteres poderiam influenciar o sucesso reprodutivo de um indivíduo aumentando sua atratividade para parceiros reprodutivos e/ou tornando-o mais hábil em disputas com indivíduos do mesmo sexo. O processo associado à manutenção de características que aumentam o sucesso reprodutivo de um indivíduo com base na escolha de parceiros sexuais recebeu o nome de seleção sexual. e pode ser dividido em dois mecanismos. Quando a seleção de um caráter ocorre porque indivíduos de um sexo preferem parceiros reprodutivos portadores de um caráter específico. o mecanismo recebe o nome de seleção inter-sexual. Por outro lado. quando a seleção do caráter ocorre por diferenças na habilidade de indivíduos de um mesmo sexo em competir diretamente por indivíduos do sexo oposto. o mecanismo é chamado de seleção intra-sexual. Estes dois mecanismos. agindo em conjunto ou isoladamente. são os responsáveis pela origem e manutenção do dimorfismo sexual encontrado em muitas espécies de animais (Shuster & Wade 2003).

In fact. the term migration covers a wide range of population displacements (Dingle and Drake 2007). and includes seasonal movements into shelters where the environmental conditions are expected to be less affected by the external environmental changes. Caves are a good example of seasonal shelter. generally with a permanently high humidity and stable temperature even during the winter (Culver and Pipan 2009).

Here. we explore the condition dependence of a male secondary sexual trait in a wolf spider and examine its influence on female mate choice. In the wolf spider Schizocosa uetzi. mature males possess a multimodal courtship display (visual + seismic) in which they slowly raise and lower their dark colored forelegs. Foreleg color is highly variable among S. uetzi males with respect to both total amount and darkness. Using diet manipulations in conjunction with color quantifications. we demonstrate condition-dependent foreleg color.

It is thought that moving with certain gaits can enable efficient. stable locomotion; however. switching gaits requires complex information flow between and coordination of an animal9s limbs. We show here that upon losing two legs. spiders can switch to a novel. more statically stable gait. or use temporal adjustments without a gait change. The resulting gaits have higher overall static stability than the gaits that would be imposed by limb loss. By decreasing the time spent in a low-stability configuration – effectively ‘limping’ over less-stable phases of the stride – spiders increased the overall stability of the less statically stable gait with no observable reduction in speed. as compared with the intact condition.

Mice are a premier model of human disease and increasingly the model system of choice for basic neuroscience. High frame rates (higher than 150 Hz) are needed to quantify the kinematics of running mice. due to their high stride frequency (up to 10 Hz).

These stimuli are designed to preserve movement patterns while minimizing static detail. with single dots representing each of the main joints of a moving animal. Imposed by their internal skeleton. vertebrate movements follow a specific semi-rigid dynamic pattern. termed ""biological-motion"". which can be used to distinguish animate from inanimate objects. Although biological motion detection has not been studied in invertebrates. rigid exoskeletons force many species to also follow semi-rigid movement principles. Due to their highly developed visual system and complex visual behaviors. we investigated the capability of jumping spiders to discriminate biological from non-biological motion using point-light display stimuli. By constraining spiders so that they could rotate but not move directionally. we simultaneously presented two point-light display stimuli with specific dynamic traits and registered their preference by observing which pattern they turned towards. Jumping spiders clearly demonstrated the ability to discriminate between stimuli. However. spiders showed no preference when both stimuli presented patterns with semi-rigid movements. results that are directly comparable to responses in vertebrate systems.

The first section (Chapters 1 and 2) investigates antmimicry by the jumping spider Myrmarachne formicaria. The second section (Chapter 3) takes a neuroethological approach to sound perception in the jumping spider Phidippus audax. Chapter 1 uses observations and collections from sites across France to study the relationship between mimics and co-occurring ant species. Behavioral trials also explore how individual jumping spiders and ants interact. Results from these studies suggest that M. formicaria is a general mimic of multiple ant species and that it does not positively associate with ants. Chapter 2 takes a quantitative approach to the study of locomotor mimicry by M. formicaria. It measures and compares aspects of gait and overall movement across non-mimetic jumping spiders. mimics. and multiple ant species. Against widely held beliefs. this work suggests that these ant mimics do not move on six legs. In their overall motion. however. M. formicaria do imitate ants. Chapter 3 uses behavioral trials and extracellular recordings of electrical activity from neurons in the jumping spider brain to explore responses to airborne acoustic stimuli.

Most prominent are the effects of exotic mammals and plants. whereas few invertebrate invasions are known to have major effects on native ecosystems. Exceptions are the well-known cases of Vespulawasps in Nothofagusforest ecosystems and Eriococcus scale insects in Leptospermum shrublands. This limited impact is surprising because over 2000 exotic invertebrates have become established in New Zealand. among them many pests of exotic crop plants. The low impact of exotic invertebrates that invaded forests and other native ecosystems in New Zealand is in contrast to the situation in other parts of the world where many invertebrates have become important pests. We provide an overview of known invasions by exotic invertebrates in New Zealand. and explore in more detail several examples of invasive species. including herbivores. predators. parasitoids. decomposers and other groups in forests. grasslands. and other terrestrial ecosystems. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the comparative scarcity of such invasions that affect New Zealand’s indigenous ecosystems. There is a common view that New Zealand’s native species and ecosystems are inherently resistant to exotic invertebrate invaders. and there is some evidence to support this view. As a result of the high level of endemism in New Zealand’s flora. many native plants are phylogenetically distant from the host plants of many plant-feeding invaders. This provides some protection.

Here. we assess. for the first time. the role of plant structure on spider communities in New Zealand native alpine tussock grasslands. We investigate the specific associations between spider assemblages and plant communities and test the hypothesis that spider diversity increases with plant diversity and tussock cover.2. Spiders were sampled using density‐ and abundance‐activity‐dependent methods. Data on physical characteristics and species composition of plants revealed gradients in vegetation. driven by distinct intra‐ecosystem plant communities. Effects of vegetation on spider diversity and composition were assessed through linear mixed‐effects models. Redundancy analysis was used to determine and visualise the spider species–level response to gradients in plant compositions.3 …,True,b3AErDAAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C,66,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-4598.2012.00195.x,6846341057307476054,/scholar?cites=6846341057307476054,,https://www.academia.edu/download/43320407/The_role_of_habitat_complexity_on_spider20160303-28644-13jx4qu.pdf,0,0,0

Using a comparative approach. we investigate the importance of each signaling modality in the courtship display of five Schizocosa species (three stridulating and two drumming) by assessing mating success under manipulated signaling environments. Irrespective of the degree of male ornamentation. the three stridulating species exhibit a dependence on the seismic. but not visual. signaling environment for mating success. Mating was independent of signaling environment for the two drumming species. We next ask whether the degree to which each species depends upon a signaling modality for mating (i.e.. modality importance) is correlated with the estimated modality-specific signal complexity.

Koch. 1871) as type species. Two other species are included in the genus: B. brounii (Urquhart. 1885) comb. nov.(here removed from synonymy with B. heroine) and B. collina (Keyserling. 1886) comb. nov.(= Araneus reversus Hogg. 1914. new synonymy). A phylogenetic analysis places Backobourkia within the ‘coxal hook clade’of the subfamily Araneinae Clerck. 1758 and close to Eriophora Simon. 1864; however. Backobourkia differs from other Australasian Araneinae by the proposed synapopomorphy of a long flange at the base of the median apophysis in males. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) supports the monophyly of Backobourkia in a limited dataset that includes exemplars of Australasian Araneidae and Eriophora ravilla (CL Koch. 1844)(type species of Eriophora Simon. 1864). Backobourkia brounii and B. heroine are sister taxa in this analysis. Backobourkia collina is unusual within the genus and amongst most Araneinae as it displays extreme sexual size dimorphism (SSD). with females on average more than four times the size of males. Comparison with the other two Backobourkia species (and other Araneinae) suggests male dwarfism rather than female gigantism for this SSD. Some morphological differences of B. collina males to its congeners are evident. possibly due to its reduced size. These include characters of putative phylogenetic signal at the genus level such as eye position. shape of male …,True,b3AErDAAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,31,https://www.senckenberg.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/68_1_framenau_79-111.pdf,13803155775768971815,/scholar?cites=13803155775768971815,,https://www.senckenberg.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/68_1_framenau_79-111.pdf,0,0,0

1141213,The use of tree-mounted artificial shelters to investigate arboreal spider communities in New Zealand nature reserves,2007,Simon Hodge and Cor J Vink and Jonathan C Banks and Mike H Bowie,35,The Journal of Arachnology,1,129-136,American Arachnological Society,Spiders have been advocated as valuable bio-indicators of forest ecosystem “health.” However. the numbers and types of spiders that are recorded at a site will usually be highly dependent on the sampling method employed. The use of lethal. indiscriminate invertebrate sampling techniques is undesirable when investigating rare species. or sampling within areas of high conservation status. Therefore we used non-lethal artificial tree-mounted shelters to monitor arboreal spiders in nature reserves near Christchurch. New Zealand.

The developmental processes through which songbirds acquire their species—typical songs have been well—studied from a proximate perspective. but less attention has been given to the ultimate question of why birds learn to sing. We present a new hypothesis for the adaptive significance of song learning in songbirds. suggesting that this specialized form of vocal development provides an indicator mechanism by which females can accurately assess the quality of potential mates. This hypothesis expands on the established idea that song can provide an indicator of male quality. but it explicitly links the variation in song expression that females use to choose mates to the developmental processes through which song is acquired. How well a male sings—reflected in repertoire size or in other learned features of a male's singing behavior—provides an honest indicator of quality because the timing …,True,_WxLkC8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,484,https://academic.oup.com/icb/article-abstract/38/1/179/112221,4608246417163908598,/scholar?cites=4608246417163908598,,https://academic.oup.com/icb/article-pdf/38/1/179/261613/38-1-179.pdf,0,0,0

In this paper I describe a pattern in the evolution of birdsongs that may reflect a constraint on vocal performance. Trilled vocalizations from 34 species of songbirds (Passeriformes: Emberizidae) were analyzed. Two acoustic variables. trill rate and frequency bandwidth. were measured for different trill types. In most species. maximal values of frequency bandwidth were found to decrease with increasing trill rates. Further. trills with low trill rates exhibited wide variance in frequency bandwidth. and trills with high trill rates exhibited only narrow frequency bandwidths.

If motions of the beak are necessary for normal song production. then disrupting the ability of a bird to perform these movements should alter the acoustic properties of its song. We tested this prediction by comparing songs produced normally by white-throated sparrows and swamp sparrows with songs produced when the beak was temporarily immobilized.

We examined patterns of selection in this population by relating individual beak sizes to interannual recaptures during a prolonged drought. Supporting the theory. disruptive selection was strong between the two beak size modes. We also found some evidence of selection against individuals with the largest and smallest beak sizes. perhaps owing to competition with other species or to gaps in the underlying resource distribution. Selection may thus simultaneously maintain the current …,True,_WxLkC8AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,122,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2008.1321,5538922139173764538,/scholar?cites=5538922139173764538,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2660944/,0,0,0
1141235,Vocal performance and sensorimotor learning in songbirds,2009,Jeffrey Podos and David C Lahti and Dana L Moseley,40,,,159-195,Academic Press,This chapter addresses the interplay of vocal performance. sensorimotor learning. and vocal evolution in songbirds. Vocal performance is increasingly recognized as an influential factor in song evolution. particularly with respect to vocal output. song consistency. and trill structure. We argue here that a comprehensive understanding of vocal performance requires attention to sensorimotor learning. a developmental phase during which birds attempt to reproduce song models memorized earlier in life. New research indicates that birds calibrate song structure during sensorimotor ontogeny in order to best match their own vocal performance capacities. Because of this relationship. performance-related features may provide reliable indicators of male quality as manifest during sensorimotor learning. We review evidence in support of the “developmental stress” hypothesis and propose that this hypothesis be expanded to …,True,_WxLkC8AAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,113,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065345409400056,3714914626926215810,/scholar?cites=3714914626926215810,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.723.745&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Ltd,1. Biomechanical trade-offs have been proposed to constrain trajectories of evolutionary diversification. In songbirds. however. one such trade-off may facilitate diversification; adaptations that enhance bite force capacity are assumed to constrain vocal performance by hampering velocities of beak gape modulations required for vocal resonance tracking during song production. Resulting divergence in vocal mating signals may thus generate mating isolation between groups that eat foods of differing size and hardness.2. We tested for a force–velocity trade-off in jaw function in Darwin’s finches. by measuring bite forces and jaw movements during song production in birds on Santa Cruz Island. Bite force and speed of jaw closing varied broadly in our sample. and were negatively correlated both within and among species.

Field studies have shown that beaks evolve by natural selection in response to variation in local ecological conditions. We posit a new hypothesis: As a consequence of beak evolution. there have been changes in the structure of finch vocal signals. We base this hypothesis on the discovery that beaks play a functional role in song production in songbirds. Recent field studies provide support for a link between beak morphology and song structure in Darwin's finches. although much remains to be learned. Because song plays a significant role in finch mating dynamics. we suggest that the functional link between beaks and song may have contributed to the process of speciation and adaptive radiation in these birds.,True,_WxLkC8AAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,107,https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-abstract/54/6/501/293928,8343300668025542030,/scholar?cites=8343300668025542030,,https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/54/6/501/293928,0,0,0

WAGNER JR,22,Physiological Entomology,3,286-290,Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Female preferences for conspicuous male calls have been documented in many groups. However. relatively few studies have examined the metabolic costs associated with the production of call types preferred by females. We measured the oxygen consumption of calling male Gryllus lineaticeps Stål crickets using closed chamber respirometry. Calling song was recorded concurrently. The average increase in mass‐specific oxygen consumption during calling was 2.7 times basal rates of oxygen consumption. and calling males consumed approximately 1.2ml O2g‐lh‐1. Oxygen consumption increased with increasing chirp rate and pulse duration. but not with increasing chirp duration. Females of this species prefer higher chirp rates. thus some call types that increase the male's attractiveness to females require more metabolic energy to produce.,True,pGq7EPAAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,140,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3032.1997.tb01170.x,1182184290526213448,/scholar?cites=1182184290526213448,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Wagner5/publication/227633128_The_energetic_cost_of_calling_in_the_variable_field_cricket_Gryllus_lineaticeps/links/59e79576a6fdccfe7f8ae460/The-energetic-cost-of-calling-in-the-variable-field-cricket-Gryllus-lineaticeps.pdf,0,0,0

Female mating preferences. in contrast. often favor traits in males that are beneficial to females. yet little is known about the effect of these preferences on the evolution of male ejaculates. A necessary condition for female preferences to affect the evolution of male ejaculate characteristics is that females select mates based on a trait correlated with ejaculate quality. Previous work has shown that females of the variable field cricket. Gryllus lineaticeps. prefer males that produce calling songs containing faster and longer chirps. In this study. we tested the hypothesis that females receive more beneficial ejaculates from preferred males.

A large-male mating advantage was detected only at one site during 1 year. Measures of calling behaviour were available for 3 years at one of the sites: on a nightly basis in 2 years. males with higher call rates were significantly more likely to mate than males with lower call rates. However. there was no relationship between mating success and either call duration or calling effort on a nightly bias in any year. In discrimination experiments. females preferred higher call rates and calls of longer duration. but not calls of lower frequency.

Se intenta mostrar que generalmente CFA siempre validará las soluciones obtenidas previamente mediante EFA. dado que la estructura factorial resultante de EFA es una de las posibles soluciones que se derivan de la matriz de datos y. por consiguiente. es previsible que en otra muestra extraída de la misma población de referencia. se confirme la estructura obtenida en la anterior.

Since ROS levels and their damage products in many plants are known to increase during senescence. it is possible that these changes are due to a decline in the levels of certain antioxidant enzymes. Using specific assays. we find that the developmental transition to bolting and flowering is associated with up to a 5-fold decline in ascorbate peroxidase activity and an increase in chloroplastid superoxide dismutase. As expected. these changes are associated with a measured increase in lipid peroxidation products.

1141292,Genotype–environment interaction and the reliability of mating signals,2004,Michael D Greenfield and Rafael L Rodriguez,68,Animal Behaviour,6,1461-1468,Academic Press,It is a central tenet of animal communication theory that signals are reliable (Zahavi 1977). That is. the characteristics of a signal that are attended to by a receiver should be reasonably good predictors of the transmitter’s current physical ability. internal state or motivation. social status. or acquired information. Signal characteristics should also predict the future consequences that a receiver. responding in a particular way. is likely to experience. Whereas the range of signals that animals transmit between one another may certainly include some messages that are not fully honest (Hasson 1994; eg Backwell et al. 2000). and partially withholding information or identity can sometimes be in a transmitter’s best interest (Johnstone 1997). animal communications are generally expected to result in a net benefit to both signaller and receiver (see Hauser 1996; Bradbury & Vehrencamp 1998). This expectation rests on the reasoning that failure to meet the criterion of reliability. as when an ‘inferior’individual broadcasts a ‘strong’signal normally associated with superior physical prowess. should result in selection against receiver responses to the signal. which. in turn. would select against its continued transmission. without alteration. by the signaller.

The CE device is coupled to an electrospray interface by a commercial sheath-flow adapter. Emphasis is placed on fulfillment of the speed and sensitivity requirements. The best separation is achieved using 32 mM ammonium formate/acid formic buffer at pH 3.1. with a working voltage of 25 kV. The MS detection of the five pesticides was performed in negative ionization mode. Full-scan spectra with base peaks corresponding to [M − H]- were obtained except for acifluorfen. which gives [M − H − CO2]- as most abundant ion.

The importance of mate choice in signal evolution can be evaluated by comparing male signal traits with female preference functions. taking into account the shape and strength of preferences. Specifically. when preferences are closed (favouring intermediate values). there should be a correlation between the preferred values and the trait means. and stronger preferences should be associated with greater preference–signal correspondence and lower signal variability. When preferences are open (favouring extreme values). signal traits are not only expected to be more variable. but should also be shifted towards the preferred values.

These rules can emerge from a variety of behavioral or other mechanisms in ways that are not always obvious.

To ask how this disparity in focus may affect the conclusions of evolutionary research. we relate the amount of diversification in mating displays to quantitative descriptions of the strength and the amount of divergence in mate preferences across a diverse set of case studies of mate choice.

Thus. we expect that such traits should show nonoverlapping distributions among closely related species. but show little to no variance among populations within a species. We tested these predictions by comparing levels of population differentiation in the sizes and shapes of male cerci (i.e.. the clasper structures used for species identity during mating) of six Enallagma damselfly species. Cerci shapes were nonoverlapping among Enallagma species. and five of six Enallagma species showed no population variation across their entire species ranges.

As visual cues. male colours should be conspicuous to other males under the specific light environments where males search for females. We tested this prediction by using spectroradiometry and two models of damselfly colour vision to determine the chromatic and achromatic contrast of males from six species of Enallagma damselflies with pond backgrounds under the ambient light conditions when each species was most active.

There is growing evidence that anthropogenic noise interferes with acoustic communication.

In this study. we investigated how road noise affects both male signalling and female phonotaxis in Oecanthus tree crickets. Acoustic signals of tree crickets. which are relatively low amplitude and composed primarily of low frequencies. are likely to be masked by road noise.

Bats are significant nocturnal predators. and insects have evolved diverse strategies for avoiding predation by bats. While it is well-known that insects exhibit anti-bat strategies. from avoidance flight to reduced acoustic signaling. the specific conditions that elicit some of these behaviors are less well-known. To illuminate how insects respond to bats in nature. we studied how calling behavior changed when katydids experienced echolocation calls in a Neotropical forest. The diverse Neotropical bat community includes species that eavesdrop on prey sounds. such as the songs produced by male katydids. Previous research has shown that some katydid species respond to echolocation calls by reducing acoustic signaling. To capture the interactions of bats and katydids. we placed acoustic monitors at 8. 16. and 24 meters in 10 locations in the forest on Barro Colorado Island.

Understanding patterns of variation and divergence in this later class of traits is particularly relevant to understanding divergence and speciation. Here. I focus on three call traits of Forbes’ Tree Cricket (Oecanthus forbesi) to quantify their capacity to produce reproductive isolation and to compare patterns of variation and divergence in these traits.

Male katydids were recorded individually using an ultrasound-sensitive microphone and high-sampling rate data acquisition board to capture both audible and ultrasonic components of calls. Calls varied enormously in duration. temporal patterning. peak frequency. and bandwidth both across and within subfamilies. We confirm previous studies showing that katydid species within the subfamily Pseudophyllinae produced short calls (< 250 ms) at long intervals and we confirm that this is true for species in the subfamily Phaneropterinae as well. Species in the Conocephalinae. on the other hand. typically produced highly repetitive calls over longer periods of time. However. there were exceptions to this pattern. with a few species in the Conocephalinae producing very short calls at long intervals. and some species in the Phaneropterinae producing relatively long calls (1–6 s) or calling frequently. Our results also confirm previous studies showing a relationship between katydid size and the peak frequency of the call. with smaller katydids producing higher frequency calls. but the slope of this relationship differed with subfamily.

He suggested that sexual selection in monogamous species results from variation in mate quality rather than in mate number and that females acquire bright plumage incidentally by “transference” from the male.Writing in The American Naturalist in 1938. Julian Huxley offered an alternative to sexual selection.

Using playbacks of field–cricket calling song in the natural habitat. we show that both female crickets and female parasitoid flies prefer male calling song with average numbers of pulses per trill. Thus female crickets exert stabilizing sexual selection. whereas flies exert disruptive natural selection on male song.

Efforts to find an alternative. virus-resistant field cricket species have led to the widespread USA (and European) distribution of a previously unnamed Gryllus species despite existing USA federal regulations to prevent such movement. We analyze and describe this previously unnamed Gryllus and propose additional measures to minimize its potential risk to native fauna and agriculture. Additionally. and more worrisome. is our incidental finding that the naturally widespread African. European. and Asian “black cricket.” G. bimaculatus. is also being sold illegally in southern California pet food stores. We assayed crickets of all five USA and European commercial species for presence of the AdDNV to document extent of the infection—all five species can be infected with the virus but only A. domesticus is killed. Based on its already cosmopolitan distribution. apparent inability to live away from human habitation. and resistance to AdDNV. we suggest that Gryllodes sigillatus is the best-suited replacement cricket for commercial production.,True,UKMOjYkAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,49,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Weissman4/publication/236013972_Billions_and_billions_sold_Pet-feeder_crickets_Orthoptera_Gryllidae_commercial_cricket_farms_an_epizootic_densovirus_and_government_regulations_make_for_a_potential_disaster/links/57c0b54f08ae2f5eb332264c.pdf,2676465747266642182,/scholar?cites=2676465747266642182,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Weissman4/publication/236013972_Billions_and_billions_sold_Pet-feeder_crickets_Orthoptera_Gryllidae_commercial_cricket_farms_an_epizootic_densovirus_and_government_regulations_make_for_a_potential_disaster/links/57c0b54f08ae2f5eb332264c.pdf,0,0,0

Series B: Biological Sciences,1458,2157-2161,The Royal Society,Male sexual displays provide females with information that is crucial to their reproductive decisions. That same information is available to eavesdroppers. with potential consequences for both signaller and receiver. We present empirical evidence for size–dependent responses to intersexual communication by conspecific rivals. Acoustic features of a male house cricket's (Acheta domesticus) mating call are positively associated with its size. with females preferring the calls of larger males. In order to investigate whether conspecific males make use of the information content of mating calls. we examined their phonotactic responses to call recordings that differ in attractiveness to females. Males of all sizes exhibited positive phonotaxis. with smaller males showing a clear preference for female–preferred calls.

A simple model of adult behavior and population genetics can explain how this resistance may have developed. This general model indicates that evolution may be caused by selection on a single gene for adult movement and that behavioral resistance only develops at high levels of rotation (>80% of plant landscape). In less diverse landscapes. crop rotation selects for the expansion of host preferences (polyphagy) by adults. More diverse landscapes may delay the evolution of resistance to crop rotation depending on the fitness costs and the nature of the genetic system.,True,Fj0gxNQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,68,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1570-7458.2001.00864.x,3719191583474388109,/scholar?cites=3719191583474388109,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.572.2511&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

In the US. Miscanthus is promoted as a crop well-suited to the Corn Belt where it could be cultivated on marginal land interposed with maize and soybean. Interactions (direct and indirect) of Miscanthus. maize. and the major Corn Belt pest of maize. the western corn rootworm. (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte. WCR) are unknown. Adding a perennial grass/biomass crop to this system is concerning since WCR is adapted to the continuous availability of its grass host. maize (Zea mays).  Methodology/Principal Findings In a greenhouse and field study. we investigated WCR development and oviposition on Miscanthus. The suitability of Miscanthus for WCR development varied across different WCR populations. Data trends indicate that WCR populations that express behavioural resistance to crop rotation performed as well on Miscanthus as on maize. Over the entire study. total adult WCR emergence from Miscanthus (212 WCR) was 29.6% of that from maize (717 WCR). Adult dry weight was 75–80% that of WCR from maize; female emergence patterns on Miscanthus were similar to females developing on maize. There was no difference in the mean no. of WCR eggs laid at the base of Miscanthus and maize in the field.

However. during the last two decades. crop rotation has ceased to be effective in an expanding area of the US corn belt. This failure appears to be due to a change in the insect's oviposition behaviour. which. in all probability. has an underlying genetic basis. A preliminary genome scan using 253 amplified fragment‐length polymorphism (AFLP) markers sought to identify genetic variation associated with the circumvention of crop rotation. Samples of D. v. virgifera from east‐central Illinois. where crop rotation is ineffective. were compared with samples from Iowa at locations that the behavioural variant has yet to reach.

This “pyramid” strategy is expected to work best when selection for resistance to 1 toxin does not cause cross-resistance to the other toxin. The most widely used pyramid is transgenic cotton producing Bt toxins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab.

Here. we developed models to characterize factors that could delay or prevent the evolution of resistance to GM crops in diploid. haplodiploid. and parthenogenetic insect pests. The standard strategy for managing resistance in diploid pests relies on refuges of non-GM host plants and GM crops that produce high toxin concentrations. Although the tenets of the standard refuge strategy apply to all pests. this strategy does not greatly delay the evolution of resistance in haplodiploid or parthenogenetic pests.

While we rely heavily on the currently used proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) in this discussion. the concepts apply to other arthropod-active proteins. A risk may exist if the newly acquired trait of the GE plant has adverse effects on NTAs when they are exposed to the arthropod-active protein. Typically. the risk assessment follows a tiered approach that starts with laboratory studies under worst-case exposure conditions; such studies have a high ability to detect adverse effects on non-target species.

Preventing or slowing the evolution of resistance by insects (“resistance management”) is critical for the sustainable use of Bt crops. Plants containing two dissimilar Bt toxin genes in the same plant (“pyramided”) have the potential to delay insect resistance. However. the advantage of pyramided Bt plants for resistance management may be compromised if they share similar toxins with single-gene plants that are deployed simultaneously.

Using a counterfactual approach. we estimated that if the technology had been made available in the year 2000 at a price that would equate per acre costs to those for insecticide-based corn rootworm control. and adopted on all of the acres treated for corn rootworm in that year. the total benefits would have been $460 million. This benefit includes $171 million to the technology developer and seed companies. $231 million to farmers from yield gains. and a further $58 million to farmers from reduced risk. time savings. and other nonpecuniary benefits associated with reduced use of insecticides. This is a one-year benefit with 100 percent adoption. Our nation-wide survey of corn producers suggests that initial adoption might be as low as 30 percent. which means that the first-year benefits might be only one-third of the value implied by 100 percent adoption. Different pricing assumptions would mostly change the distribution of the benefits between farmers and others. so long as the pricing did not influence the adoption rate as well. Benefits over time would reflect changing adoption patterns and evolving insect resistance.

Three case studies related to reduced control from glyphosate are: (1) a weed population that has become resistant to glyphosate. with horseweed in Tennessee as an example; (2) a weed population increases due to lack of control in “glyphosate only” systems. with tropical spiderwort in Georgia cotton used as an example; and (3) the hypothetical resistance of common waterhemp to glyphosate in Illinois. For each of these case studies. an economic analysis was performed using a partial budget approach. This economic analysis provides the cost of control to the farmer when glyphosate fails to control these weeds and gives a critical time in years to compare different glyphosate resistance management philosophies (applicable only before resistance has evolved).

Direct survey methods were used to elicit grower valuation of pecuniary and non-pecuniary benefits. We illustrate a hedonic strategy combined with principal component analysis to address part-whole bias present in previous assessments of non-pecuniary benefits of RR crops. Based on a national telephone survey of 1.205 growers. the mean reported benefit of RR relative to conventional seed varieties was more than $20 per acre for corn and soybean growers and about $50 per acre for cotton growers.

Use of a residual herbicide and annual rotation of herbicides are two practices to reduce the risk of weed resistance.

This study explores the importance of 13 characteristics. including characteristics that influence profitability. using data from a telephone survey of 1.205 corn. cotton. and soybean growers. We estimate a multivariate probit model to explore how the importance of these 13 characteristics varies with observable grower and farm- operation differences.

Results show that growers rate characteristics such as consistency of control. crop safety. and family and employee health as very important more often than herbicide cost. The factor analysis suggests that health and environmental concerns. yield concerns. and herbicide-application concerns capture important unobservable preferences that influence grower decisions.

1141449,The Effect of Farmers’ Decisions on Pest Control with Bt Crops: A Billion Dollar Game of Strategy,2015,Alice E Milne and James R Bell and William D Hutchison and Frank van den Bosch and Paul D Mitchell and David Crowder and Stephen Parnell and Andrew P Whitmore,11,PLoS computational biology,12,e1004483,Public Library of Science,A farmer’s decision on whether to control a pest is usually based on the perceived threat of the pest locally and the guidance of commercial advisors. Therefore. farmers in a region are often influenced by similar circumstances. and this can create a coordinated response for pest control that is effective at a landscape scale. This coordinated response is not intentional. but is an emergent property of the system. We propose a framework for understanding the intrinsic feedback mechanisms between the actions of humans and the dynamics of pest populations and demonstrate this framework using the European corn borer. a serious pest in maize crops. We link a model of the European corn borer and a parasite in a landscape with a model that simulates the decisions of individual farmers on what type of maize to grow. Farmers chose whether to grow Bt-maize. which is toxic to the corn borer. or conventional maize for which the seed is cheaper. The problem is akin to the snow-drift problem in game theory; that is to say. if enough farmers choose to grow Bt maize then because the pest is suppressed an individual may benefit from growing conventional maize. We show that the communication network between farmers’ and their perceptions of profit and loss affects landscape scale patterns in pest dynamics. We found that although adoption of Bt maize often brings increased financial returns. these rewards oscillate in response to the prevalence of pests.,True,DW71SsQAAAAJ:MIg0yeAD4ggC,24,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004483,15031170397108034289,/scholar?cites=15031170397108034289,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004483,0,0,0

Three phylotypes of head lice A. B and C exist but body lice have been observed only in phylotype A. Head and body lice have different behaviours and only the latter have been involved in outbreaks of infectious diseases including epidemic typhus. trench fever and louse borne recurrent fever. Recent studies suggest that body lice arose several times from head louse populations.  Methods and Findings By introducing a new genotyping technique. sequencing variable intergenic spacers which were selected from louse genomic sequence. we were able to evaluate the genotypic distribution of 207 human lice.

The majority of transcripts were associated with protein synthesis and metabolism. Serine proteases were the main proteolytic enzymes detected. Some 40% of the cytochrome P450 genes and 74% of the glutathione S transferases (GSTs) in the genome of D. melanogaster were observed to be expressed in the midgut by oligoarray analysis. We also identified potential transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) of P450s. GSTs and carboxylesterases.

Maruca vitrata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). which we subsequently used to estimate divergence and relationships within the lepidopteran lineage. The arrangement and orientation of the 13 protein-coding. 2 rRNA. and 19 tRNA genes sequenced was typical of insect mitochondrial DNA sequences described to date. The sequence contained a high A+T content of 80.1% and a bias for the use of codons with A or T nucleotides in the 3rd position. Transcript mapping with midgut and salivary gland ESTs for mitochondrial genome annotation showed that translation from protein-coding genes initiates and terminates at standard mitochondrial codons. except for the coxI gene. which may start from an arginine CGA codon. The genomic copy of coxII terminates at a T nucleotide. and a proposed polyadenylation mechanism for completion of the TAA stop codon was confirmed by comparisons to EST data.

Two-way selection for honey bees that hoarded high and low levels of pollen in nucleus colonies was made for four generations. Two different lines of bees were produced in which high-line colonies hoarded significantly more pollen than low-line colonies. Rapid separation exhibited by the two lines suggests that the heritability of this trait is high (divergence h2 = 49.5 percent ± 20.3 percent).

In 2009. Bt maize was planted on more than 22.2 million hectares. constituting 63% of the U.S. crop. Using statistical analysis of per capita growth rate estimates. we found that areawide suppression of the primary pest Ostrinia nubilalis (European corn borer) is associated with Bt maize use. Cumulative benefits over 14 years are an estimated $3.2 billion for maize growers in Illinois. Minnesota. and Wisconsin. with more than $2.4 billion of this total accruing to non-Bt maize growers.

Harmonia axyridis (Pallas). native to Asia. has recently been detected in South America after successfully invading North America and Europe. This coccinellid is a voracious predator; therefore. it is popular and effective in biological control. Unfortunately. H. axyridis also has associated adverse impacts (i.e.. as a household pest. pest of fruit production. and threat to non-target organisms). To predict the potential geographic extent of impacts of H. axyridis in South America we review the history of its invasion in the Western Hemisphere and address various factors critical to the future invasion (i.e.. arrival. establishment. and spread) of new areas of South America. The likelihood of continued introductions (i.e.. arrival) of H. axyridis to South America seems high. due to its popularity as a biological control agent and through accidental introductions. Establishment also seems likely in broad regions of South America. Climate matching with the native range suggested that much of southern South America may be suitable for establishment. In contrast. habitat matching with the native range suggested that northern South America may be more suitable. In addition. prey availability should not limit establishment of this predator. Once established. H. axyridis seems likely to spread by flight and human-assisted means.

We update a previously developed potential distribution model to highlight the global invasion threat. with emphasis on the risks to the United States. The continued range expansion of H. armigera in Central America is likely to change the invasion threat it poses to North America qualitatively. making natural dispersal from either the Caribbean islands or Mexico feasible. To characterise the threat posed by H. armigera. we collated the value of the major host crops in the United States growing within its modelled potential range. including that area where it could expand its range during favourable seasons. We found that the annual value of crops that would be exposed to H. armigera totalled approximately US$78 billion p.a.. with US$843 million p.a. worth growing in climates that are optimal for the pest. Elsewhere. H. armigera has developed broad-spectrum pesticide resistance; meaning that if it invades the United States. protecting these crops from significant production impacts could be challenging.

However. relatively few plans have been tested adequately to gauge their utility in the field. The software presented here should facilitate a validation approach in which actual field data sets are resampled numerous times to arrive at average performance values and associated variances. The major strength of this resampling approach is that analyses are based on actual sampling distributions of arthropod populations. not those specified by a theoretical model.

It is well suited because of its long growing seasonand tolerance to diseases (Teare et al.. 1989) and insects. with the exception of the fall armyworm [Spodoptea frugiperda (JE Smith)](Teare et al.. 1990). Dry weather normally keeps yields around 60 to 80 bu/acre for spring-planted. non-irrigated temperate corn in the Coastal Plain of the Southern states and around 30 bu/acre for sum mer-planted corn (Teare and Wright. 199Oa). Low yields and low prices have dramatically reduced acreage of temperate corn in the southeast. Farmer acreage of tropical corn increased from 5.000 acres in 1986 to almost 40.000 acres in 1989 in the southern US because growerswanted a more consistent grain or silage crop that could be grown under natural rainfall conditions to increase profitability and cash flow and provide a rotation crop in lieu of summer legumes (soybean and peanut. Teare et al.. 1989) to reduce nematode numbers that build up from the continuous cropping of summer le gumes. Since tropical corn is grown after wheat har vest during the summer months when rainfall is most bountiful. it should perform more consistently in the southeast thantemperate corn.

Direct plant effects may involve simple mechanisms such as reduced parasitoid searching efficiency caused by trichomes. Multitrophic effects often involve complex interactions that are not well understood. and their impact on natural enemies and biological control are difficult to predict. Knowledge of the direct and multitrophic effects creates opportunities to increase the effectiveness of natural enemies by incorporating natural enemy–enhancing traits into crop plants. The strategy may have potential for both generalist and specialist natural enemies. but the enemies' behavior and other factors will affect the results.

This redirection is consistent with the growing consensus among the dengue-prevention community that no single intervention will be sufficient to control dengue disease. The PDC's expectation is that when an effective dengue virus (DENV) vaccine is commercially available. the public health community will continue to rely on vector control because the two strategies complement and enhance one another. Although the concept of integrated intervention for dengue prevention is gaining increasingly broader acceptance. to date. no consensus has been reached regarding the details of how and what combination of approaches can be most effectively implemented to manage disease. To fill that gap. the PDC proposed a three step process: (1) a critical assessment of current vector control tools and those under development. (2) outlining a research agenda for determining. in a definitive way. what existing tools work best. and (3) determining how to combine the best vector control options. which have systematically been defined in this process. with DENV vaccines. To address the first step. the PDC convened a meeting of international experts during November 2013 in Washington. DC. to critically assess existing vector control interventions and tools under development.

Farmers grow refuges of host plants that do not produce Bt toxins to promote survival of susceptible pests. Many modelling studies predict that refuges will delay resistance longest if alleles conferring resistance are rare. most resistant adults mate with susceptible adults. and Bt plants have sufficiently high toxin concentration to kill heterozygous progeny from such matings. In contrast. based on their model of the cotton pest Heliothis virescens. Vacher et al.

The most common type of resistance has been called “Mode 1” and is characterized by recessive inheritance. >500-fold resistance to and reduced binding by at least one Cry1A toxin. and negligible cross-resistance to Cry1C. In three lepidopteran species. Heliothis virescens. Pectinophora gossypiella. and Helicoverpa armigera. Mode 1 resistance is caused by mutations in a toxin-binding 12-cadherin-domain protein expressed in the larval midgut.

The choice of application equipment. and manner in which the nematodes are applied. can have substantial impact on pest control efficacy. For example. nozzle or pumping system types are some of the parameters that can affect nematode performance following spray applications. Operating pressures for some nematode species may reach up to 2000 kPa without notable damage. whereas other species may require lower pressure limits. e.g.. 1380 kPa for Heterorhabditis megidis. In addition to application equipment. a variety of other abiotic and biotic factors must be considered. In general. a rate of 25 infective juvenile nematodes/cm2 is required for successful pest suppression.

Microbial control can be defined as the use of insect diseases (viruses. fungi. bacteria. protists. or nematodes) for pest suppression. In order to improve the use of microbial control agents. it is also important to study the causes of disease outbreaks. ie. epizootics. An epizootic is defined as an outbreak of disease in which there is an unusually large number of cases. A central question in insect pathology is: what are the factors that cause an epizootic? The question is addressed through the discipline of epizootiology. ie. the study of animal disease dynamics on a population level. The major factors influencing an epizootic can be divided into four basic components:(1) the pathogen (disease-causing) population;(2) the host population;(3) transmission; and (4) the environment. Although the question pertaining to the causes of an epizootic is of great interest to all aspects of insect pathology. it is of particular interest to microbial control efforts. In this chapter we present a summary and analysis of epizootiological principles and the concepts of microbial control. The goal is to promote expanded studies in epizootiology. and foster research and implementation toward improved microbial control programs.Technical Abstract: An epizootic is defined as an outbreak of disease in which there is an unusually large number of cases.

Thirty-four aphid species were identified from green and yellow tile traps in 1992. 25 in 1993. and 26 in 1994. Yellow tile traps caught significantly more aphids overall than green tile traps and were significantly preferred by Aphis helianthi Monell. Capitophorus elaeagni (del Guercio). and Rhopalosiphummaidis (Fitch …,True,5xRCby4AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,83,https://academic.oup.com/jee/article-abstract/90/3/824/2216634,7758785992196209042,/scholar?cites=7758785992196209042,,,0,0,0
