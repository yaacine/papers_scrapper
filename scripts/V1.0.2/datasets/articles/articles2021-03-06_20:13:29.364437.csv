1160279,Exploring multifunctional agriculture. A review of conceptual approaches and prospects for an integrative transitional framework,2009,Henk Renting and WAH Rossing and JCJ Groot and JD Van der Ploeg and Catherine Laurent and Daniel Perraud and Derk Jan Stobbelaar and MK Van Ittersum,90,,,S112-S123,Academic Press,In the last decade the multifunctional agriculture (MFA) concept has emerged as a key notion in scientific and policy debates on the future of agriculture and rural development. Broadly speaking. MFA refers to the fact that agricultural activity beyond its role of producing food and fibre may also have several other functions such as renewable natural resources management. landscape and biodiversity conservation and contribution to the socio-economic viability of rural areas. The use of the concept can be traced to a number of wider societal and political transformation processes. which have influenced scientific and policy approaches in different ways amongst countries and disciplines. This paper critically discusses various existing research approaches to MFA. both from natural and social sciences. To this aim different strands of literature are classified according to their focus on specific governance mechanisms …,True,Rz0HgYEAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,541,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479708003484,11068803621444338180,/scholar?cites=11068803621444338180,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49471462/Exploring_multifunctional_agriculture._A20161009-11118-1a0ij6x.pdf,0,0,0

Consequently. fermentation processes with clearly contrasting gas production kinetics can be identified. Parameterization of the separate processes is possible with a suitable multiphasic model and modelling method. A flexible. empirical. multiphasic model was proposed for parameterization of gas production profiles. This equation was fitted. using a two-step method. to four gas production profiles and the maximum fractional rate of substrate digestion (RM) was calculated for each phase. In the first step. the number of phases and starting values for parameters of the multiphasic model were derived from a combination of either (1) the measured cumulative gas production profile and its first (rate of gas production) and second (change in rate of gas production) derivative or (2) a …,True,Rz0HgYEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,492,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377840196010127,1763533381706885533,/scholar?cites=1763533381706885533,,https://www.academia.edu/download/44088236/Multiphasic_analysis_of_gas_production_k20160324-8775-flpifh.pdf,0,0,0

A large number of factors may influence its accuracy. such as furnace type. sample mass. duration and temperature of ignition and clay content of samples. We conducted a series of experiments to quantify these effects. which enabled us to derive (i) guidelines for ignition conditions (sample mass. duration and temperature). (ii) temperature‐specific soil organic matter (SOM) to soil organic carbon (SOC) conversion factors and (iii) clay content‐dependent correction factors for structural water loss (SWL). Bulk samples of a sandy soil (4% clay) and a silt loam soil (25% clay) were used to evaluate the effects of ignition conditions.

Complexity arises due to the high number of stakeholders and due to the limited knowledge. which is often organized along disciplinary divides. This paper sets out from the premise that the role of agronomy in such land use planning processes can be strengthened by approaches that allow multi-objective and multi-scale evaluation of spatially explicit land use alternatives. We present an application of the explorative Landscape IMAGES framework. which employs the Differential Evolution optimization strategy and the concepts of Pareto optimality that are relatively easy to implement and to combine with spatially explicit indicator assessments.

Designing and adopting more sustainable farming systems for such mosaic landscapes involves communal decision-making and active participation of local smallholders. Currently. a wide variety of participatory approaches to involve individual farmers in such design processes is available. However. methodologies that address communal decision-making processes as seen in complex smallholder agricultural landscapes are still rare.

The measured VFA were used to predict the gas production and fermentable OM using stoichiometric calculations. For CW the volume and kinetics of measured gas production were the same as those predicted from the VFA formed. In contrast. the measured gas production for CC was consistently less than predicted. indicating that the stoichiometric equations were not valid for rapidly fermenting substrates.

Farm diversity can be broadly described in terms of resource endowment and resource use strategy. or in other words. in terms of scale and intensity of production. Measuring intensity of production requires much greater monitoring effort than measuring scale of production. and often only proxies of production intensity are used. Using data from a regional farm survey and from intensive on-farm monitoring the question addressed in this paper is to which extent results of farm surveys that measure primarily scale of production can inform on-farm interventions aimed at improving farm performance.

Ltd,Organic matter digestibility (OMD) is determined from the proportion of indigestible cell wall (ICW) in the total plant organic matter. To improve understanding of processes governing the proportion of ICW. plant morphological development. and leaf composition and digestibility were studied for Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam). Since grass is usually grown in swards. a comparison was made between spaced and sward grown plants. The time course of ICW accumulation in individual leaves on the main stem (MS) could be described by a negative exponential saturation curve. Remarkably. the curvature and the asymptotic ICW as a proportion of total leaf cell wall mass were the same for all leaves in both the spaced and the sward plants.

Various methods exist. commonly using statistical analysis. to create these typologies. We demonstrate that the methodological decisions on data collection. variable selection. data-reduction and clustering techniques can bear a large impact on the typology results. We illustrate the effects of analysing the diversity from different angles. using different typology objectives and different hypotheses. on typology creation by using an example from Zambia’s Eastern Province. Five separate typologies were created with principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). based on three different expert-informed hypotheses. The greatest overlap between typologies was observed for the larger. wealthier farm types but for the remainder of the farms there were no clear overlaps between typologies. Based on these results. we argue that the typology development should be guided by a hypothesis on the local agriculture features and the drivers and mechanisms of differentiation among farming systems. such as biophysical and socio-economic conditions. That hypothesis is based both on the typology objective and on prior expert knowledge and theories of the farm diversity in the study area. We present a methodological framework that aims to integrate participatory and statistical methods for hypothesis-based typology construction. This is an iterative process whereby the results of the statistical analysis are compared with the reality of the target population as hypothesized by the local experts.

The limited effectiveness of policies is often attributed to methodological aspects of policy implementation. However. an alternative reason can be the limited internalization of policies. so that these are only implemented to a minimum level to attain benefits or avoid penalties. It is postulated that increased internalization of policies can considerably improve their effectiveness and that suitable institutional arrangements exist to support such increases in internalization.

In this study. we use a spatially explicit model to project land-use changes caused by that expansion in 2020. assuming that ethanol (biodiesel) production increases by 35 (4) x 109 liter in the 2003-2020 period. Our simulations show that direct land-use changes will have a small impact on carbon emissions because most biofuel plantations would replace rangeland areas. However. indirect land-use changes. especially those pushing the rangeland frontier into the Amazonian forests. could offset the carbon savings from biofuels.

1160315,Integrated Models of the Land System: A Review of Modelling Approaches on the Regional to Global Scale.,2008,Rüdiger Schaldach and Jörg A Priess,2,Living Reviews in Landscape Research,,,,Land-use change has been identified as one the most important processes to understand and to model global change. It is the result of complex interactions between human and environmental driving factors. A key to capturing this complexity is the analytical framework of land systems as coupled human-environment systems. a concept that is a central component of the science plan of the Global Land Project. Based on this framework. this paper presents an overview of eight integrated models of the land system. The review concentrates on model approaches that include processes of both the human and the environment sub-system and which operate in a spatially explicit manner on a regional to global scale. Another criterion used to select models is that they take into account interplay and competition between different land-use activities. eg between agriculture and urban development. Each model is reviewed separately in detail with focus on the different aspects of the land system that are represented within the model and on the implemented modelling concepts. This is done by systematically addressing the following topics: model purpose and application. model concepts for the human sub-system and for the environment sub-system and linkages between the sub-systems (model integration). Based on these findings commonalities and differences between the models are discussed and further research needs are identified.,True,MTHWbUgAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,109,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.689.4200&rep=rep1&type=pdf,5851100289086514792,/scholar?cites=5851100289086514792,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.689.4200&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Considering that limitation of suitable land and/or competition with other land uses might occur in both countries. assessments of potential crop productivity can contribute to an improved planning of land requirements for biofuels under high productivity or marginal conditions. In this paper we model the potential productivity of sugarcane and jatropha in both countries. Land requirements for such expansions are calculated according to policy scenarios based on government targets for biofuel production in 2015. Spatial variations in the potential productivity lead to rather different land requirements. depending on where plantations are located. If jatropha is not irrigated. land requirements to fulfill the Indian government plans in 2015 would be of 410 000 to 95 000 km2 if grown in low or …,True,MTHWbUgAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,101,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953409000786,9686126957967280151,/scholar?cites=9686126957967280151,,,0,0,0

Aboveground litter production (total 5.58; leaves 4.30 Mg ha−1 year−1) was low. but comparable to other tropical forests. Due to the low nutrient status. net production of fine roots was among the highest ever reported (11.14 Mg ha−1 year−1). Only 20% of fine root stock was alive. 80% consisted of necromass. Similar values were obtained for dead and living root tips. Element concentrations in fine roots (including bio- and necromass). especially Ca. were low. whereas Al concentrations were relatively high.The upper limit of average fine root lifetime was 253 days.

In this review we establish the relationship between eutrophication of fresh inland surface waters in SSA and the release of nutrients in their mega-cities. Monitoring reports indicate that the population of mega-cities in SSA is rapidly increasing. and so is the total amount of wastewater produced. Of the total amounts produced. at present. less than 30% is treated in sewage treatment plants. while the remainder is disposed of via onsite sanitation systems. eventually discharging their wastewater into groundwater.

To determine if a model structure is realistic. i.e. if it captures the relevant runoff processes. both performance and consistency are important. We define performance as the ability of a model structure to mimic a specific part of the hydrological behaviour in a specific catchment. This can be assessed based on evaluation criteria. such as the goodness of fit of specific hydrological signatures obtained from hydrological data. Consistency is defined as the ability of a model structure to adequately reproduce several hydrological signatures simultaneously while using the same set of parameter values. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a new evaluation Framework for Assessing the Realism of Model structures (FARM). The evaluation framework tests for both performance and consistency using a principal component analysis on a range of evaluation criteria. all emphasizing different hydrological behaviour. The utility of this evaluation framework is demonstrated in a case study of two small headwater catchments (Maimai. New Zealand. and Wollefsbach. Luxembourg). Eight different hydrological signatures and eleven model structures have been used for this study. The results suggest that some model structures may reveal the same degree of performance for selected evaluation criteria while showing differences in consistency.

Moreover. understanding of the runoff generation processes is essential for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydrological response of a catchment. Many methods for base flow separation exist. but hardly one focuses on the specific behaviour of temperate lowland areas. This paper presents the results of a base flow separation study carried out in a lowland area in the Netherlands. In this study. field observations of precipitation. groundwater and surface water levels and discharges. together with tracer analysis are used to understand the runoff generation processes in the catchment. Several tracer and non-tracer based base flow separation methods were applied to the discharge time series. and their results are compared. The results show that groundwater levels react fast to precipitation events in this lowland area with shallow groundwater tables. Moreover. a good correlation was found between groundwater levels and discharges suggesting that most of the measured discharge also during floods comes from groundwater storage. It was estimated using tracer hydrological approaches that approximately 90% of the total discharge is groundwater displaced by event water mainly infiltrating in the northern part of the catchment. and only the remaining 10% is surface runoff.

We first obtained an overview of rainfall patterns through the analysis of 16 point data sources. The results led to choosing three distinct regions. i.e.~the east coast. inland and west coast regions. For detailed analysis. Shepard's interpolation scheme was applied to the station data to produce daily rainfall fields on a 0.05 degree resolution grids for the period 1971–2006. The rainfall characteristics in time and space derived from a frequency analysis were found to be distinctly different in these three regions. In the east coast region. monthly rainfall shows a significant periodicity dominated by an annual cycle. followed by a half-year cycle. The inland and west coast regions show that the dominant periodic fluctuations in the monthly rainfall are dominated by a half-year cycle. followed by an annual cycle. The long-term rainfall variability analysis shows that the dry and wet conditions in Peninsular Malaysia are not primarily governed by the ENSO events. The results from the individual regions suggest that although the relative variability is influenced by ENSO. local and regional conditions have an effect on the interannual rainfall variability. which is superimposed on the large-scale weather conditions. A significant increasing trends in annual rainfall (9.3 mm/year) and northeast monsoon rainfall (6.2 mm/monsoon) were only detected in the west coast region.

Many studies have tried to quantify these fluxes. but they encountered difficulties in quantifying the relative contribution of evaporation and transpiration. In this study. we compared three different methods to estimate evaporation fluxes during simulated summer conditions in a grass-covered lysimeter in the laboratory. Only two of these methods can be used to partition total evaporation into transpiration. soil evaporation and interception. A water balance calculation (whereby rainfall. soil moisture and percolation were measured) was used for comparison as a benchmark. A HYDRUS-1D model and isotope measurements were used for the partitioning of total evaporation. The isotope mass balance method partitions total evaporation of 3.4 mm d−1 into 0.4 mm d−1 for soil evaporation. 0.3 mm d−1 for interception and 2.6 mm d−1 for transpiration. while the HYDRUS-1D partitions total evaporation of 3.7 mm d−1 into 1 mm d−1 for soil evaporation. 0.3 mm d−1 for interception and 2.3 mm d−1 for transpiration. From the comparison. we concluded that the isotope mass balance is better for low temporal resolution analysis than the HYDRUS-1D. On the other hand.

Using the process-based catchment model TACD (tracer aided catchment model. distributed) two land-use scenarios were analysed for the rural and mountainous Dreisam basin (258 km2): (i) an increase in urban area from 2.5% to 5%) and (2) a change in a natural land-use to a different kind of forest.

Ethiopia,2010,Ermias Teferi and S Uhlenbrook and Woldeamlak Bewket and J Wenninger and Belay Simane,14,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,12,2415-2428,Copernicus GmbH, Wetlands provide multiple ecosystem services such as storing and regulating water flows and water quality. providing unique habitats to flora and fauna. and regulating micro-climatic conditions. Conversion of wetlands for agricultural use is a widespread practice in Ethiopia. particularly in the southwestern part where wetlands cover large areas. Although there are many studies on land cover and land use changes in this region. comprehensive studies on wetlands are still missing. Hence. extent and rate of wetland loss at regional scales is unknown. The objective of this paper is to quantify wetland dynamics and estimate wetland loss in the Choke Mountain range (area covering 17 443 km2) in the Upper Blue Nile basin. a key headwater region of the river Nile. Therefore. satellite remote sensing imagery of the period 1986–2005 were considered. To create images of surface reflectance that are radiometrically consistent. a combination of cross-calibration and atmospheric correction (Vogelman-DOS3) methods was used. A hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach was used to classify the images. Overall accuracies of 94.1% and 93.5% and Kappa Coefficients of 0.908 and 0.913 for the 1986 and 2005 imageries. respectively were obtained. The results showed that 607 km2 of seasonal wetland with low moisture and 22.4 km2 of open water are lost in the study area during the period 1986 to 2005.

1160372,The environmental consequences of trade: Evidence from subnational trade flows,2006,Pandej Chintrakarn and Daniel L Millimet,52,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,1,430-453,Academic Press,The debate over the environmental consequences of free trade is not only quite heated. but also entails significant policy ramifications. Recently. cross-sectional analysis at the country level has made use of exogenous determinants of trade to identify the causal effect of trade on the environment. finding moderate evidence of a beneficial impact of expanded trade on environmental quality. Given the stakes involved. we revisit this finding using subnational data on ‘trade’ flows across US states and several measures of pollution. Not only does the analysis shed further light on the debate at the international level. but also addresses a heretofore unexamined question: does greater inter-regional commerce at the subnational level harm the environment? Our findings are striking. providing further evidence against a negative environmental impact of trade for the majority of measures analyzed.

The empirical approach in these studies typically relies on estimating reaction functions in a uni-dimensional policy framework. where a nonzero slope estimate is interpreted as evidence in support of strategic interactions. While this framework is a useful representation within certain contexts. it is potentially too restrictive; for example. in models of resource competition. localities may use multiple instruments in their recruiting pursuits. leading to potential strategic interactions across policy instruments.

A key component of these regulations is the New Source Review (NSR) requirement. which includes the contentious stipulation that when an existing plant seeks to modify its operations. the entire plant must comply with current standards for new sources. This requirement was included to improve air quality in dirty areas. and prevent a deterioration of air quality in clean areas.

The model is used to quantify material deprivation at the census tract level using data from the 1990 U.S. Census in Rhode Island.

1160395,On the estimation of treatment effects with endogenous misreporting,2019,Pierre Nguimkeu and Augustine Denteh and Rusty Tchernis,208,Journal of econometrics,2,487-506,North-Holland,Participation in social programs is often misreported in survey data. complicating the estimation of treatment effects. We propose a model to estimate treatment effects under endogenous participation and endogenous misreporting. We present an expression for the asymptotic bias of both OLS and IV estimators and discuss the conditions under which sign reversal may occur. We provide a method for eliminating this bias when researchers have access to information regarding participation and misreporting. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator and assess its small sample performance through Monte Carlo simulations.

However. causal interpretation of estimates from previous studies. comparing participants to non-participants. is complicated by endogeneity and possible misreporting of participation in SNAP. In this paper. we take a novel approach to examine quasi-experimental variation in SNAP benefit amount on adult obesity. Children of SNAP households qualify for free in-school meals. thus freeing some additional benefits for the household. A greater proportion of school-age children eligible for free in-school meals proxies for an exogenous increase in the amount of SNAP benefits available per adult. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1979 we show that school meals represent a non-trivial part of the food budget for SNAP households.

Data come from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth linked to the Child and Young Adult Supplement. We first show that mothers’ work hours increase gradually as the age of the youngest child rises. whereas mothers’ spouses’ work hours exhibit a discontinuous jump at kindergarten eligibility.

The present computation scheme is based on recent developments of the Direct Method from Finite Speed Thermodynamics (FST). The Direct Method consists in analyzing any irreversible cycle. step by step. by writing the corresponding equation of the First Law of Thermodynamics for finite speed processes and integrating it on the whole cycle. for each process. The First Law expression for finite speed processes includes three of the main sources of internal irreversibilities. namely: finite speed interaction between the piston and the gas/vapour. friction due to the finite piston speed within the cylinder. throttling processes in the valves.

These equations are used later for calculating entirely analytically the performances of the cycle. as a function of the finite speed of the piston and also as a function of other parameters such as: vapour temperatures and pressures in the evaporator. respectively in the condenser. compression ratio and mass flow rate.

For both analyzed schemes the overall energy efficiency can be achieved due to high heat recuperation ratio. The implementation of the integrated cogeneration concept can lead to avoiding significant energy losses by a controlled cooling of the flue gases. The available energy potential can be then used for power generation needed for technological processes and/or for other purposes within the company. Thus. due to these measures there can be achieved an increase of the furnace efficiency up to 51 %. compared to the reference solution of 39 %.

ASME/JSME Thermal Engineering Joint Conference,6,189,日本機械学会,Although having thermodynamic optimization as a common objective. the principle methods of cycle analysis; Thermodynamics with Finite Speed (TFS) and Thermodynamics in Finite Time (TFT) are quite different. In TFT. time and the temperature of the working fluid in the cycle are the variables that are optimized. The optimization is based on maximizing the cycle power rather than the cycle efficiency. Analyses that include the internal irreversibilities of the cycle using this method have been neglected until recently and he efforts that have been made have generally not been systematic or applicable to cycles other than the Carnot cycle. An aspect of the past neglect of internal irreversibility issues is that the adiabatic processes of the cycle have received much less attention than the isothermal processes. They have been projected to occur in a short time interval compared to the time allocated to the isothermal processes. This is of no consequence in the optimization of an endo-reversible Carnot cycle. but there can be dramatic consequences when internal irreversibilities are taken into account. As the time frame for the adiabatic processes shortens. the internal irreversibilities increase and may reach values sufficient to dramatically degrade the overall cycle performance. By contrast. in TFS. piston speed and the temperatures of the working fluid in the cycle are the main variables that are optimized. The optimization in TFS that is presented in this paper focuses on both the efficiency and the power output of the engine. The analysis includes the effect of piston speed during both the adiabatic processes and the isothermal processes in determining …,True,uBY26g8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,27,https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002495596/,12194525344896523499,/scholar?cites=12194525344896523499,,,0,0,0

Based on the combined use of two techniques of theoretical thermodynamics known as the First Law of Thermodynamics for Processes with Finite Speed and the Direct Method. the analysis takes into account the effects of both internal and external irreversibilities of the engine. The energy balance for the system of engine and receiver includes the performance characteristics of the receiver element when concentrated solar radiation from the collector is beamed to it. Pressure losses due to the fluid friction internal to the engine and the mechanical friction between the moving parts of the engine are estimated through extensive use of the performance data taken from currently operating Stirling engines.

The increasing logistics and transport activities in the city significantly impact on the environment we live in. Provision of green and sustainable logistics services is on the top of logistics service providers’(LSPs) agendas and can also become a competitive edge to their customers (Piecyk and Björklund. 2015). Both academics and industry have shown increasing attention to measure the logistics sustainability in the recent decade. yet limited research has been developed comprehensively (Evangelista et al.. 2018). Thus. LSPs’ sustainability performance measurement methods and relevant indicators need to be assessed and updated particularly in the context of city logistics. To fill this gap. this paper aims to identify and evaluate the current frameworks and indicators that reflect the performance of LSPs’ environmental sustainability in academic publications. and further propose a practical set of sustainability indicators to assess the city logistics ‘greenness’ and environmental sustainability in LSPs’ operations.Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this aim. a systematic literature review was carried out to map out the existing measurement indicators of environmental sustainability that apply in city logistics and LSPs domains.

The paper integrates different methods in order to facilitate a deep understanding of the adoption level of ebusiness in SMEs in. Firstly. semi-structured interviews are conducted with SMEs’ managers. Secondly. a questionnaire is used to generalise and verify the findings from stage 1 to the SME population. Four hypotheses are tested at 0.05 level significance. The collected data are analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Independent-samples t-test is used to find the differences in the size and age of the SMEs as well as the significant relationship between the size and age of SMEs on the level of e-business adoption. Also. linear regression examines the relationship between the predictor variables on the level of e-business adoption. About 23.5% of SMEs have employees between 1 and 9. and 76.5% of SMEs have employees between 10 and 49; therefore the majority of them are medium sized firms.

Recent environmental regulations have also stimulated interest in this field. However. information sharing is a prerequisite to effective supply chain and. compared to developed Western companies. was argued to be 10-20 years behind in China (Li and Yuan. 2009). This barrier needs to be addressed if China is going to maintain and grow its manufacturing position in the world.The paper explores the perceptions of senior management toward green supply chains and information sharing in Chinese electronic manufacturers. Semi-structured interviews of eighteen senior managers of electronic manufactures in Jiangsu province China were conducted. Thematic analysis is applied and the findings contrasted to other research. The paper provides insight to the current status of managers’ views to information sharing and green supply chain initiatives. This allows for the potential for the initial exploratory findings to inform a deeper piece of work that could lead to optimal intervention. The paper also proposes some initial recommendation for future development in order to mitigate this barrier. Future research directions are also considered.

The paper concentrates on owner-managers and discusses the implications of this on the theoretical framework. contrasting Neo-classical Economic Theory to Behavioural Economics with regard to decision-making of firm’s.This paper partly addresses the initial challenges of advancing transport logistics from a behavioural decision making framework. The European Union has made a commitment to promoting sustainable mobility through advanced transport logistics. One of the principal areas to be addressed is the potential barriers to advancing transport logistics and the attitudes of industry to this advancement. It has been recognised that there is currently insufficient research in regard to these barriers and that there is a need to establish a measurement and benchmarking process. The paper’s main focus is the attitudes to change and development of owner-operated hauliers in the Republic of Ireland.

1160498,An Examination of EU Directive 98/76/EC in Regards to the Irish Road Haulage Industry,2003,Eoin Plant and Declan Allen and Edward Sweeney,,,,,Technological University Dublin,The Irish economy experienced a tremendous increase in economic growth during the 1990s and early 21st Century (Celtic Tiger). This economic boom was export driven and the Irish Road Haulage Industry transported the majority of products produced at some stage. if not a number of stages in the logistics tunnel. In recent times there has been somewhat of a growing unease in the road haulage industry in relation to increasing costs. squeezing already tight profit margins. A report commissioned by the Department of Public Enterprise illustrated that 48% of hauliers identified themselves as needing training in the area of cost calculation (Indecon. 1999). As a result. many hauliers are unable to accurately analyse costs; this can lead to incorrect management decisions in relation to pricing and rate setting. with the potential to significantly erode profitability levels. The Indecon report stated.“this is an area where there is very little information in the industry”(Indecon. 1999: 95). This research attempts to analyse current costing practices/models in the Irish Road Haulage Industry in order to improve understanding of the current capabilities of Hire and Reward operators in relation to financial management. The first step of the research methodology was an intensive search for pertinent literature. from which a limited amount of information was obtained. Primary research was undertaken through the use of a structured postal questionnaire. Empirical evidence of the current financial management capabilities of Irish road haulage hire and reward operators obtained from the research instrument is contrasted and compared with the 1998 EU Directive 98/76 …,True,f3MnAjUAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://arrow.tudublin.ie/nitlcon/56/,,,,,0,0,0

However current methods of oxygen production are energy intensive and so reduce the efficiency and power output of the plant. A relatively new technology. which can solve this problem. involves Ion Transport Membranes (ITMs). which are permeable to oxygen and no other substance and require significantly less energy per unit of oxygen than current methods of oxygen production.Much research has been conducted on ITMs. both as oxygen producers and when used to partially oxidate methane for syngas production. However. these studies have been conducted at different temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. using membranes with different thicknesses and surface geometries. All of these factors affect the oxygen flux through the membrane.

A current proposed configuration of the cycle requires an oxygen ion transport membrane air separation unit operating at 920 °C and a separate combustion chamber operating at 1400 °C. If oxygen is consumed by a chemical reaction on the permeate side of an oxygen transport membrane. the oxygen flux is larger. so the air separation unit can be physically smaller. In addition. if this reaction is exothermic. the air separation unit is heated by the reaction. requiring no additional heating. Combustion fulfils both of these requirements. so combustion in the oxygen transport membrane air separation unit would allow a smaller air separation unit. which would also act as a combustion chamber.

1160503,Investigation into the possible use of an oxygen ion transport membrane combustion unit in an oxyfired power plant,2007,Kirsten Foy,,,,,Technological University Dublin,It is generally recognised that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions damage the environment. Carbon capture and storage offers the possibility of using fossil fuels for power production without releasing C02. In the proposed ZEITMOP power plant cycle hydrocarbon fuel is burned in a mixture of oxygen and C02. allowing easy separation of combustion products to capture the C02 for sequestration. Oxygen ion transport membranes (OTMs) provide oxygen. The original configuration of the cycle requires an OTM air separation unit. in which oxygen is separated from air and mixed with CO2. and a separate combustion chamber. in which fuel is burned in this mixture. Another possibility is to use a combined OTM combustion chamber and air separation unit. The oxygen is consumed by the combustion as soon as it permeates through the OTM. and the operating temperature of the OTM unit is the combustion temperature. The aim of the current research is to investigate the possible use of an oxygen ion transport membrane combustion unit in the ZEITMOP oxyfired cycle. OTM materials were compared. The combined ZEITMOP cycle was stimulated. During the course of the research a new cycle was developed and named the OFFCET cycle. The results of initial calculations on this cycle are described. An experimental rig was designed and built. Some work was also carried out on the ZEMPES cycle. It was found that the efficiency of the combined cycle using a perovskite unit would be very low due to the low operating temperature. The efficiency of the combined cycle with a fluorite unit may be higher than the efficiency of the separate cycle at the same …,True,IguczxEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,10,https://arrow.tudublin.ie/engdoc/7/,10128293153391404619,/scholar?cites=10128293153391404619,,,0,0,0

This paper quantitatively assesses the environmental impact of building-related and user-related gas and electricity consumption in a Dutch apartment dwelling using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Several scenarios for gas and electricity consumption are compared to assess what effect changes in building characteristics and user behaviour have on the environmental impacts of energy consumption. This study shows that gas consumption significantly contributes to four environmental impact categories. which can be most effectively countered by reducing the heat demand of the dwelling. A 23% reduction in gas consumption leads to up to 13% less overall environmental impacts.

1160522,The effect of energy performance regulations on energy consumption,2012,Olivia Guerra-Santin and Laure Itard,5,Energy Efficiency,3,269-282,Springer Netherlands,Governments have developed energy performance regulations in order to lower energy consumption in the housing stock. Most of these regulations are based on the thermal quality of the buildings. In the Netherlands. the energy efficiency for new buildings is expressed as the EPC (energy performance coefficient). Studies have indicated that energy regulations are successful in lowering the energy consumption in residential buildings. However. the actual energy consumption is usually different from the expected energy consumption. This paper explores the effectiveness of energy performance regulations in lowering the energy consumption of dwellings built in the Netherlands after 1996.

Wrong decisions and design failures related to a building’s general layout. shape. façade transparency or orientation can increase the operational energy tremendously. These failures can be avoided in advance through simple changes in the design. Using extensive parametric energy simulations by DesignBuilder. this paper investigates the impact of geometric factors for the energy-efficiency of high-rise office buildings in three climates contexts: Amsterdam (Temperate). Sydney (Sub-tropical) and Singapore (Tropical). The investigation is carried out on 12 plan shapes. 7 plan depths. 4 building orientations and discrete values for window-to-wall ratio. Among selected options. each sub-section determines the most efficient solution for different design measures and climates. The optimal design solution is the one that minimises. on an annual basis. the sum of the energy use for heating. cooling. electric lighting and fans. The results indicate that the general building design is an important issue to consider for high-rise buildings: they can influence the energy use up to 32%. For most of the geometric factors. the greatest difference between the optimal and the worst solution occurs in the sub-tropical climate. while the tropical climate is the one that shows the smallest difference. In case of the plan depth. special attention should be paid in the case of a temperate climate. as the total energy use can increase more than in other climates.

In this paper. we review the development and current situation of the Renewable Energy Sources Cooperatives (REScoops) in Spain. assessing their strengths. barriers and opportunities as a means towards SD. This is an interesting case study since. unlike other European countries. they have recently arisen in a regulatory and economic hostile context. which have induced particular organizational and operating structures.We identify strengths coherent with SD in common with social enterprises such as the focus on satisfying needs rather than creating new ones. the high motivation and awareness of the members. and the capacity to provide social and environmental benefits. In terms of barriers to SD. we find difficulties to combine membership growth with participation. a low integration with other social enterprises and a risk of denaturation of the intended change. Also. within a growth paradigm. REScoops may simply add new energy generation to the mix. without transforming it. We find a dominant perception that renewables could substitute fossil-fuel generation without challenging the system. Finally. not all renewable technologies might be compatible with a SD approach. To date in Spain. REScoops:(1) remain very minorital;(2) have barely managed to promote new generation;(3) have only focused on electricity;(4) show a weak (although increasing) collaboration between them.

Simulation is an indispensable ingredient of the descriptive design approach. which provides the designer with precise and accurate projections of the performance and behavior of a design. The paper describes the application of a particular class of simulation techniques. computational fluid dynamics (CFD). to the analysis and evaluation of indoor climate. Using two different CFD systems as representatives of the class. we describe: relevant computational possibilities and limitations of CFD simulation; the accessibility of CFD simulation for architects. especially concerning the handling of simulation variables; the compatibility of CFD representations of built space with similar representations in standard CAD and modeling systems. including possibilities for feedback; The relations between geometric representation and accuracy / precision in CFD simulation. We propose that CFD simulation can become an operational instrument for the designer. provided that CFD simulation does not become a trial and error game trying to master computational techniques.

This investigation can be summarized as an introduction of computer vision to the computerization of architectural representations: chap represents an attempt to automate recognition of the most essential among conventional architectural drawings. floor plans. The system accepts as input digitized images of architectural plans and recognizes their spatial primitives (locations) and their spatial articulation on a variety of abstraction levels. The final output of chap is a description of the plan in terms of the grouping formations detected in its spatial articulation. The overall structure of the description is based on an analysis of its conformity to the formal rules of its “stylistic” context (which in the initial version of chap is classical architecture). Chapter 1 suggests that the poor performance of computerized architectural drawing and design systems is among others evidence of the necessity to computerize visual / spatial architectural representations.

1160599,Simulation for analysis: Requirements from architectural design,1996,Alexander Koutamanis and Vicky Mitossi,,,,,CUMINCAD,Computerization has been a positive factor in the evolution of both kinds of analysis with respect to cost. availability and efficiency. Knowledge-based systems offer an appropriate implementation environment for normative analysis which can be more reliable and economical than evaluation by human experts. Perhaps more significant is the potential of interactive computer simulation where designs can be examined intuitively in full detail and at the same time by quantitative models. The advantages of this coupling are evident in the achievements of scientific visualization. Another advantage of computational systems is that the analysis can be linked to the design representation. thereby adding feedback to the conventional visualization of designs in drawing and modeling systems. Such connections are essential for the development of design guidance systems capable of reflecting consequences of partial inadequacies or changes to other aspects in a transparent and meaningful network of design constraints.   The possibilities of computer simulation also extend to issues inadequately covered by normative analysis and in particular to dynamic aspects of design such as human movement and circulation. The paper reports on a framework for addressing two related problems. (a) the simulation of fire escape from buildings and (b) the simulation of human movement on stairs. In both cases we propose that current evaluation techniques and the underlying design norms are too abstract to offer a measure of design success. as testified by the number of fatal accidents in fires and on stairs. In addition. fire escape and stair climbing are characterized …,True,wRL9U_IAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,19,http://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/Show?8ee5,5854076830477857183,/scholar?cites=5854076830477857183,,http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/8ee5.content.02952.pdf,0,0,0

Dordrecht,Analysis of pedestrian circulation in buildings is usually performed in the early stages of the design process or later on with respect to a specific design problem such as fire safety. In both cases. the analysis relates more to wayfinding. i.e. search for a route on the basis of fundamental normative criteria. Wayfinding analysis in existing buildings is useful for the comparison between “rational” behaviour and actual usage but this comparison does little to explicate the observed structure of pedestrian circulation. In contrast to wayfinding. route analysis deals with the registration and assessment of actual patterns of pedestrian circulation in existing buildings. These patterns are represented topologically and geometrically. The geometric representation makes use of norms underlying building codes in order to reach an appropriate level of abstraction.

As a result. practice is showing an increasing interest in the utility of such drawings. This interest is linked to a fundamental promise of computerization in architecture. the analysis and evaluation of a building’s behaviour and performance during the design process. The main drawback of conventional computerized drawings is that they are restricted toplotting orthographic or. less frequently. perspective projections. This effectively reduces the computer to a mere electronic drafting table and computerized drawings to unstructured. haphazard collectionsof arbitrarily chosen graphic elements. normally of the lowest possible complexity. The lack of structure and in particular of meaningful. relevant primitives leads to inadequate support even for basic analyses and evaluations. We consider the structure of computerized design representations with respect to the choice of primitives that facilitate automation of analysis and support focused feedback. We argue that current drawing systems are capable of deriving the basic dual network of ‘solid’ building elements and ‘void’ spaces on the basis of user-input descriptions of familiar entities and that this network is sufficient for normative analyses.,True,wRL9U_IAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,17,http://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/Show?ddss9843,8871241130242129839,/scholar?cites=8871241130242129839,,http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/ddss9843.content.pdf,0,0,0

1160604,Prolegomena to the recognition of floor plan sketches: A typology of architectural and grafic primitives in freehand representation,2001,Alexander Koutamanis,,"Design Research, the Netherlands, 2000",,,,Despite being a mixed and transitional case (Goodman 1976). visual architectural representations have been extremely productive and expressive design tools. Drawings have replaced buildings as the primary product of the architect since the Renaissance. in what appears to be an attempt to elevate the status of the master builder to that of a scientific or artistic designer (Evans 1995; Porter 1997). This has resulted into not only many worthwhile buildings but also a huge number of images that document design processes and products from a variety of viewpoints. Our knowledge of world architecture relies more on published images than on personal experience (Evans 1989). In recent years our already highly visual culture has been further enhanced by social and technological developments. including the democratisation of the computer. the proliferation of the Internet and the popularisation related multimedia technologies. These have created an opportune environment for the digital dissemination of visual architectural information. uniquely suited as a repository of architectural imagery.In most current information systems images are treated as discrete. integral entities. They are indexed through textual annotations and associated with other information items manually. Analysis of images. eg in the framework of content-based retrieval. can recover a number of important features. such as the number and shape of spaces or the overall shape of a floor plan. It can also produce the general topological pattern of such features. For practical reasons. however. image analysis is generally restricted to a small number of salient features. These form the …,True,wRL9U_IAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,16,http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/5e33.content.00615.pdf,17071300997910486285,/scholar?cites=17071300997910486285,,http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/5e33.content.00615.pdf,0,0,0
1160605,Sketching with digital pen and paper,2005,Alexander Koutamanis,,,,321-330,Springer. Dordrecht,Architectural sketching with the computer has been possible for some time now. Using manual and optical digitizers architects have been able to create images similar in structure and appearance to conventional sketches on paper. Digitized sketches are traditionally associated with early design but are also increasingly linked to interactive interfaces and information management. The paper reports on the application of a new technology (Anoto) that uses a digital pen on specially prepared paper. The focus of the application was feedback from analogue documents to the computer programs used for preparing these documents and on the roles of freehand sketching in later design phases. Sketching with digital pen and paper was found to be useful for the management of annotations made on analogue versions of digital information. especially in multi-actor synchronous and asynchronous situations.,True,wRL9U_IAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,15,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-4020-3698-1_30,13756531032796743282,/scholar?cites=13756531032796743282,,,0,0,0
1160606,A practical experiment in the representation and analysis of buildings,1998,M van Leusden and V Mitossi,,4rd Design and decision support systems in architecture and urban planning conference,,,,The TYPOLOGY project was set up by the Dutch Government Building Agency (GBA) to explore computerised representations of buildings that allow analysis of various aspects of their performance. So far this project produced the RF-model. an abstract computerised representation. Physical elements of the building are not represented as such. only individual spaces and boundary segments along which they are adjacent are represented explicitly. Spaces can have any number of functional properties such as the general category of floor area they are included in. the activities they accommodate. or the particular safety compartment or circulation system they belong to. Similarly. boundary segments may. for example. provide access or view. may be included in a particular category. such as interior walls. or in a safety or security barrier. The RF-model enabled the presentation and quantitative analysis of design proposals for large and complex buildings such as courts of justice and prison buildings. The model is also used in a multiaspect analysis of a series of recently erected Dutch prison buildings. We expect that these first results will develop into a rich and professional precedent-based system. to be used in the early stages of design. The strategic goal of the project is to derive from the accumulated models and their analysis a more general understanding of the relations between a building’s actual characteristics and various aspects of its performance.,True,wRL9U_IAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,15,http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/ddss9861.content.pdf,1745665439625237977,/scholar?cites=1745665439625237977,,http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/ddss9861.content.pdf,0,0,0

1160608,Simulation and evaluation of environmental aspects throughout the design process,1998,JP den Hartog and A Koutamanis and PG Luscuere,,,,,CUMINCAD,The evaluation of environmental aspects in architectural design has traditionally been performed by means of simple (and often simplistic) rule systems. These generally remain at the normative level of minimal control one encounters in building rules and regulations. thereby failing to provide sufficient information and clarity for design guidance. Despite this. evaluation results normally bound subsequent design decisions as fundamental. inflexible constraints. At much later design stages. when architectural form has been largely crystallized and when environmental subsystems must be specified in detail. both the architect and the contributing engineers often realize the severe limitation of the initial choices. A frequently voiced argument for such simplification in the guise of abstraction is the lack of detailed information on the form and functional content of a building in the early stages of the design process. This obviously presupposes a tabula rasa generative approach. The application of a priori knowledge in the form of types. cases. precedents and automated recognition permits direct transaction from the abstract to the specific at and between a number of predefined relevant abstraction levels in the representation. The combination of a priori knowledge at the typological level with multilevel representations permits the use of precise simulation techniques already in the early design stages and throughout the design process. The simulation results employ the dual representation principle of scientific visualization. thereby linking form with measurable performance.

A design is represented by its atomic components which may vary according to abstraction level. their properties and. if possible. their relationships.

The application of artificial neural networks for prediction of power tiller noise is set out in the present paper. The sound pressure signals for noise analysis were obtained in a field experiment using a 13-hp power tiller. During measurement and recording of the sound pressure signals of the power tiller. the engine speeds and gear ratios were varied to cover the most normal range of the power tiller operation in transportation conditions for the asphalt. dirt rural roads. and grassland. Signals recorded in the time domain were converted to the frequency domain with the help of a specially developed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) program. The narrow band signals were further processed to obtain overall sound pressure levels in A-weighting. Altogether. 48 patterns were generated for training and evaluation of artificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks were designed based on three neurons in the input layer and one neuron in the output layer. The results showed that multi layer perceptron networks with a training algorithm of back propagation were best for accurate prediction of power tiller overall noise.

The shift distance for each curve measured relative to a chosen reference curve is called the shift factor. This allows the drying curves to shift horizontally along the time axis through a time multiplier (shift factor) until a smooth master curve is created. The master curves can be used to address air temperature and air velocity effects on the drying kinetics through the use of the shift factors. The purpose of the present work was to test the validity of this method. called the time-temperature superposition technique (TTST). in order to model the effects of air temperature (AT) and air velocity (AV) on drying kinetics of avishan (Zataria multiflora L.) leaves (AL).

The basic flow is obtained by solving the thin-layer Navier-Stokes equations using the Beam and Warming method. The linear-stability equations are derived in body-fitted orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. The usual asymptotic boundary conditions for the disturbance equations are re¬ placed with linearized Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions.

The model of a 6-cylinder turbocharged engine (Holset HDX55V) was calibrated using an experimental BSFC map to predict engine exhaust thermodynamic conditions such as exhaust mass flow rate and exhaust temperature under various operating conditions. These engine exhaust conditions were then utilized to feed the inlet conditions for both the ORC and turbocompounding models. evaluating the available exhaust energy to be recovered by each technology. Firstly the ORC system model was simulated to obtain the power that can be generated from the system. Having this additional power converted to useful work. the BSFC was observed to reduce around 2–5% depending upon engine’s speed and BMEP. The initial model of the engine was then modified by considering a second turbine representing turbocompounding heat recovery system. The BSFC was increased due to the back-pressure from the second turbine. but the energy generated from the turbine was sufficient to reduce the BSFC further. However. by application of turbocompounding no improvement in BSFC was achieved at low engine’s speeds.

In the present study. eight different cultivars of dates viz.. Khodry. Khalas. Ruthana. Sukkari. Sefri. Segae. Ajwa and Hilali were sequenced for rpoB and psbA-trnH genes and analyzed using bioinformatics tools to establish a cultivar-specific molecular signature. The combined aligned data matrix was of 1147 characters. of which invariable and variable sites were found to be 958 and 173. respectively. The analysis clearly reveals three major groups of these cultivars:(i) Khodary. Sefri. Ajwa. Ruthana and Hilali (58% BS);(ii) Sukkari and Khalas (64% BS); and (iii) Segae. The economically most important cultivar Ajwa showed similarity with Khodary and Sefri (67% BS).

Sci,258,e267,,Currently. graphene nanosheets (GNS) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are two most popular 2D layered materials in electrochemical applications due to their excellent physico-chemical properties. Herein. we have developed a facile method to prepare a ternary nanocomposite composed of graphene.(MoS2and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and described its electrochemical sensing applicability in the determination of folic acid (FA). The morphological. elemental. impedance and electrochemical attributes of the GNS–MoS2–AuNPs ternary nanocomposite are studied in detail. Next. GNS–MoS2–AuNPs is deposited on screen printed electrode (SPCE) and applied for the electrochemical sensing of folic acid. Interestingly. the composite has excellent electrocatalytic ability to folic acid due to good synergic effect between GNS. MoS2 and AuNPs. The developed sensor detects FA in wide linear range of 50 nM–1150 µM and displays low detection limit of 38.5 nM. The sensor performance of the GNS–MoS2–AuNPs is either superior or comparable to the previously reported electrodes. Moreover. the electrode has good repeatability. reproducibility and stability.

FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-like gene function is crucial for the initiation of flowering in various plant species and also in asexual reproduction in tuber plants. By employing various computational analysis using RNA-Seq data. we identified eight FT-like genes (AcFT) encoding PEBP (phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein) domains in Allium cepa. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of FT-like proteins revealed six proteins that were identical to previously reported AcFT1-6 proteins. as well as one (AcFT7) with a highly conserved region shared with AcFT6 and another (comp106231) with low similarity to MFT protein. but containing a PEBP domain. Homology modelling of AcFT7 proteins showed similar structures and conservation of amino acids crucial for function in AtFT (Arabidopsis) and Hd3a (rice). with variation in the C-terminal region. Further. we analyzed AcFT expression patterns in different transitional stages. as well as under SD (short-day). LD (long-day). and drought treatment in two contrasting genotypic lines EM (early maturation. 36101) and LM (late maturation. 36122). The FT transcript levels were greatly affected by various environmental factors such as photoperiod. temperature and drought. Our results suggest that AcFT7 is a member of the FT-like genes in Allium cepa and may be involved in regulation of onion bulbing. similar to other FT genes. In addition. AcFT4 and AcFT7 could be involved in establishing the difference in timing of bulb maturity between the two contrasting onion lines.

It has been estimated that 1% of the open reading frames of a genome is dedicated to glycosylation. Many different enzymes are involved in glycosylation. such as glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. Traditionally. glycosyltransferases are classified based on their enzymatic activities by Enzyme Commission (http://www. chem. qmul. ac. uk/iubmb/enzyme/). Based on the activated donor type. glycosyltransferases are named. for example glucosyltransferase. mannosyltransferase and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases. However. classification of glycosyltransferases based on the biochemical evidence is a difficult task since most of the enzymes are membrane proteins. Reconstruction of enzymatic assay for the membrane proteins are intrinsically more difficult than soluble proteins. Thus the purification of membrane-bound glycosyltransferase is a difficult task. On the other hand. with the recent advancement of genome projects. DNA sequences of an organism are readily available. Furthermore. bioinformatics annotation tools are now commonly used by life science researchers to identify the putative function of a gene. Hence. new approaches based on in silico analysis for classifying glycosyltransferase have been used successfully.

1160894,Simulation of 2D tomographic TDLAS using algebraic reconstruction and Tikhonov regularization,2013,Avishek Guha and Ingmar Schoegl,,8th US National Combustion Meeting,,,,Tomographic techniques allow for the reconstruction of spatially varying temperature and concentration fields in a flame from line-of-sight integrated tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) measurements. Such methods generally need data taken from a large number of view angles to gather as much directional information about the property distribution inside the flame as possible. Often. optical access for such measurements is limited. which poses substantial problems for conventional tomographic methods. In recent years. hyper-spectral approaches have shown promising results. where the lack of directional information is compensated by increased spectral information from wide-band tunable lasers. This work uses an alternative approach for tomographic reconstruction that uses conventional DFB diode lasers with narrow tunability. which are commonly used for line-of-sight TDLAS measurements. Specifically. the feasibility of performing limited-view tomographic reconstruction using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) for temperature and concentration of water vapor in a stationary flame is addressed. Simulated TDLAS line-of-sight (LOS) data consist of second harmonic peak heights (2f) obtained from wavelength modulation. Ratio thermometry from twotransition technique is used to infer local temperature and concentration of the species in the flame.

1160910,Behavior of preheated premixed flames at rich conditions,2013,Joseph Gibson and Mohsen Ayoobi and Ingmar Schoegl,34,Proceedings of the Combustion Institute,1,997-1005,Elsevier,Over the past decade. a series of studies has demonstrated non-catalytic hydrogen production via partial oxidation of fuel-rich mixtures that lie well beyond the conventional rich flammability limits. In all cases. heat recirculation from the post-reaction zone to the unburned mixture leads to significant increases of combustion temperatures and mass burning flux. Although the feasibility of self-sustained combustion at extremely rich conditions is well established. fundamental questions on this combustion regime have not been addressed. As a first step. the present study relates the inherently non-adiabatic operation of heat-recirculating combustors to adiabatic combustion with highly preheated fuel/air mixtures.

Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) is proven to be most powerful to capture these interactions. It however is not practical for realistic problems due to computational expenses. In other numerical techniques such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Reynolds-Averaged and Favre-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS and FANS) models. small scale details are either overlooked or modeled with simplistic equations to reduce the computational expenses. RANS and FANS are known to be defective for naturally-unsteady processes. and LES is based on the assumption that the flame interactions with the flow and eddy structures are negligible at scales smaller than a certain filter size. With that. new methodologies should be sought to account for combustion physics at small scales without insignificant computational expenses. In this study. the predictive capability of physics-based machine learning (ML) techniques are investigated for combustion modeling. Specifically. a physics-based data-driven proxy (PB-DDP) model is developed based on DNS simulations at small scale to predict flame properties (ex. laminar flame speed) at new operating conditions.

Such fuels are most suitable for addressing the increasing demands on combustion-based micro power generation systems due to their prominently higher energy density as compared to other energy resources such as batteries. This cultivates a great opportunity to develop portable power devices. which can be utilized in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). micro satellite thrusters or micro chemical reactors and sensors. However. combustion at small scales—whether premixed or non-premixed (diffusion)—has its own challenges as the interplay of various physical phenomena needs to be understood comprehensively. This paper reviews the scientific progress that researchers have made over the past couple of decades for the numerical investigations of diffusion flames at micro scales. Specifically. the objective of this review is to provide insights on different numerical approaches in analyzing diffusion combustion at micro scales. where the importance of operating conditions. critical parameters and the conjugate heat transfer/heat re-circulation have been extensively analyzed.

1160921,Behavior of preheated premixed flames at lean conditions,2013,Mohsen Ayoobi and Ingmar Schoegl,,,,,,The ultra-lean combustion regime extends below the conventional lean flammability limit. where viable flames require substantial preheating of the reactant mixture. A large number of simulations of adiabatic laminar flames with detailed reaction kinetics and pseudo-randomly distributed inlet temperatures (Tin= 300− 1000 K) and equivalence ratios (φ= 0.12− 1.0) is used to investigate fundamental aspects of lean and ultra-lean combustion of methane/air mixtures. Common features of flame characteristics are studied as a function of inlet temperature. equivalence ratio. mass flux and peak temperatures. which are used to parameterize the solution space. Holding individual parameters constant. a comparison of flame structures reveals that a characteristic temperature at the transition from preheating zone to the active reaction zone is reliably predicted by the local mass flux. Another characteristic temperature marking complete reaction of the fuel is predicted by the peak temperature. Overall. findings demonstrate that a parameterization using initial temperature and/or equivalence ratio fails to predict parameters of the inner reaction zone. Yet. results show that key features within the flame structure of premixed combustion are essentially unchanged throughout the lean and ultra-lean regime. where burning rates determine the temperature at which the preheating layer transitions into the active reaction zone. It is shown that peak temperatures determine characteristics of the active reaction zone irrespective of the mixture stoichiometry.,True,Ez_CoOgAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://sutherland.che.utah.edu/USCI2013/PAPERS/2F02-070LT-0390.pdf,10824310954717832479,/scholar?cites=10824310954717832479,,https://sutherland.che.utah.edu/USCI2013/PAPERS/2F02-070LT-0390.pdf,0,0,0

A significant obstacle. however. is the production and distribution of hydrogen. Production at the site of use is widely believed to be a viable near-term solution. Hydrocarbon fuels that are readily transported can be reformed into synthesis gas. or syngas. which is a gaseous mixture of hydrogen. carbon monoxide and other species. Fuel reforming therefore permits high density energy storage that can effectively replace or supplement batteries for remote applications. Current industrial methods of syngas production do not scale down efficiently. but an alternative method. non-catalytic partial oxidation. is a viable option for small scale production.

The conversion of butanol and Jet-A were demonstrated in a filtration reactor consisting of a packed bed of spheres. A second reactor. consisting of counterflowing channels. has the advantage of stationary reactions zones and the ability to operate continuously.

Linear models are found to work reasonably well predicting the force response for the sine-squared gust. whereas the top-hat gust exhibits significant nonlinear effects at the largest gust ratios.

1160968,Comparison between experiments and simulations of fast plunge maneuvers,2020,M Moriche and O Flores and G Sedky and AR Jones and M García-Villalba,559,AIAA Paper,,,,There is a growing interest in characterizing force production on wings in unsteady situations. One of the reasons behind is the proliferation of unmanned and micro air vehicles. which typically fly in unsteady environments such as urban areas. This poses a challenge to the controllability of the vehicle. in particular when the flow perturbations are of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed. If this is the case. classical solutions based on small perturbations and linear theory1 are no longer applicable. The flow surrounding the wing is subject to non-linear phenomena involving flow separation and the formation of leading edge vortices (LEVs) and trailing edge vortices (TEVS) that substantially influence the aerodynamic forces on the wings. As a consequence. in order to predict the aerodynamic forces in such unsteady situations it is necessary to resort to experiments and time-dependent numerical simulations.The flow perturbations in unsteady environments are highly variable. so that researchers often consider canonical configurations to characterize the different contributions to the aerodynamic response of the wing. One recent example of the use of canonical configurations is the work of Leung et al. 2 who modelled transverse gusts using different airfoil motions: pitching. plunging and surging. Another example is the work of Mulleners et al. 3 who modelled a streamwise gust using surging motions of the wing. In this study we focus on plunge maneuvers. but the literature on canonical motions is broad. including also pitch maneuvers. 4–6 surging maneuvers7 or wing rotation. 8. 9 As already mentioned. plunge maneuvers have been used …,True,LJkgHhUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,2,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Girguis_Sedky/publication/338400405_Comparison_between_experiments_and_simulations_of_fast_tranverse_plunge_maneuvers/links/5e7f942b92851caef4a8e0c1/Comparison-between-experiments-and-simulations-of-fast-tranverse-plunge-maneuvers.pdf,8075107091536715798,/scholar?cites=8075107091536715798,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Girguis_Sedky/publication/338400405_Comparison_between_experiments_and_simulations_of_fast_tranverse_plunge_maneuvers/links/5e7f942b92851caef4a8e0c1/Comparison-between-experiments-and-simulations-of-fast-tranverse-plunge-maneuvers.pdf,0,0,0

A nonlinear state-feedback control law is designed to stabilize unsteady pitching behavior. Linearization of the closed-loop system establishes the existence of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. which gives rise to a stable limit cycle. Control gains that produce the greatest time-averaged lift achieve a 40% improvement from the maximum steady-pitch lift.

There is little experimental data and theoretical analysis available in the literature to elucidate the mechanisms. It is reasonable to assume that. as the dimensions of flow channels approach the micro-level. viscous dissipation could be too significant to be neglected due to a high velocity gradient in the channel.

The study employed a general-purpose performance model by considering the thermodynamic cycle of the compressor and its mechanical losses. The real gas equation of state is used to describe the changes of state of the refrigerant. The study reveals that for this quarter horse-power compressor unit the energy consumption in performing the compression cycle was 80–90% of the compressor shaft energy input. and the other 10–15% of the energy was dissipated as mechanical friction. The results also show that the performance predictions are satisfactory when compared with measured results.

The unsteady continuity. momentum and energy equations for the gas flow in the scroll chamber were formulated. The curvilinear. moving and deforming scroll chamber was modeled employing the body-fitted coordinate grid by applying a “two-boundary” algebraic method.

In this analysis. the intricate components of a hermetic compressor were divided into 46 geometrically simplified discrete elements and each was assumed to be at a uniform temperature. The lumped thermal conductance method was then applied to all the components of the compressor to form 46 simultaneous equations. which were then solved to get the components’ temperatures.

The slip effect between the two phases was often not considered in this small diameter (about 1 mm) capillary tube. Due to the lack of experimental information of the slip ratio in the flow within the capillary tube. the more comprehensive separated two-phase flow model was not frequently used in theoretical studies. This paper attempts to exploit the possibility of the separated flow model. Comparisons of the predicted results between the homogeneous and the separated flow models are presented. together with experimental results from previous workers.

The majority of the existing literature focuses on feedback controllers that use measurements from the turbine itself and possibly an estimate or measurement of the current local wind profile. This work investigates a predictive controller that can use short‐term predictions about the approaching wind field to improve performance by compensating for measurement and actuation delays.Simulations are carried out using the FAST aeroelastic design code modelling the NREL 5 MW reference turbine. and controllers are designed for both above rated and below rated wind conditions using model predictive control.

Part II: gliding parallel to a wall,2010,Shane P Windsor and Stuart E Norris and Stuart M Cameron and Gordon D Mallinson and John C Montgomery,213,Journal of Experimental Biology,22,3832-3842,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Blind Mexican cave fish (Astyanax fasciatus) are able to sense detailed information about objects by gliding alongside them and sensing changes in the flow field around their body using their lateral line sensory system. Hence the fish are able to build hydrodynamic images of their surroundings. This study measured the flow fields around blind cave fish using particle image velocimetry (PIV) as they swam parallel to a wall. Computational fluid dynamics models were also used to calculate the flow fields and the stimuli to the lateral line sensory system. Our results showed that characteristic changes in the form of the flow field occurred when the fish were within approximately 0.20 body lengths (BL) of a wall. The magnitude of these changes increased steadily as the distance between the fish and the wall was reduced. When the fish were within 0.02 BL of the wall there was a change in the form of the flow field owing …,True,w_8aMdgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,62,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/22/3832.short,17759834322855077441,/scholar?cites=17759834322855077441,,https://jeb.biologists.org/content/jexbio/213/22/3832.full.pdf,0,0,0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of stent design on wall shear stress (WSS). time average WSS. and WSS gradient (WSSG). in idealized stent geometries using computational fluid dynamics. Strut spacing. thickness. luminal protrusion. and malapposition were systematically investigated and a comparison made between two commercially available stents (Omega and Biomatrix). Narrower strut spacing led to larger areas of adverse low WSS and high WSSG but these effects were mitigated when strut size was reduced. particularly for WSSG. Local hemodynamics worsened with luminal protrusion of the stent and with stent malapposition. adverse high WSS and WSSG were identified around peak flow and throughout the cardiac cycle respectively.

Horizontal-axis wind turbines are the most popular type of turbines and the aeroacoustic noise generated by their rotating blades is known to be the most significant noise source. The region of the turbine blade that produces the strongest acoustic sources has been identified in published acoustic camera measurements. In the present work. a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of this region is carried out using an annular computational domain. which leads to a significant reduction of computational expense compared to full blade simulations.

Many current industry tools for modelling these effects are limited to empirically derived predictions. A technique is described for coupling transient wind modelling with an aero‐elastic simulation to dynamically model both turbine operation and wake structures. The important feature of this approach is a turbine model in a flow simulation. which actively responds to transient wind events through the inclusion of controller actions such as blade pitching and regulation of generator torque. The coupled nature of the aero‐elastic/flow simulation also allows recording of load and control data. which permits the analysis of turbine interaction in multiple turbine systems.

This reactor has previously been found to have a reaction rate maxima for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue across a spinning disc reactor. The reaction rate maxima occurred at an intermediate flow rate of 15 mL/s and rotational speeds of 100 and 200 rpm. where the reaction kinetics switched from first order to second order with a change in the flow structure. The findings of this work show that the reaction rate maxima is most likely in part caused by periodic forcing from the peristaltic pump increasing the mass transfer of the oxygen. The enhancement in the rate of oxygen transfer to the surface of the disc would increase the charge carrier separation in the catalyst. increasing the reaction rate kinetics.

By comparison with the Deaves and Harris model it is shown that such a pressure driven boundary layer is a reasonable model for the lower half of the atmospheric boundary layer where the shear stress decreases approximately linearly with height. The profiles derived satisfy equilibrium of the momentum and both turbulence property conservation equations. It is shown that using these profiles as the inlet conditions on an empty domain results in outlet profiles which are almost identical to the inlet values.

The simulations are performed using a finite volume Boussinesq code with a Smagorinsky turbulence model for a range of buoyancy Reynolds numbers. ranging from transitional currents (Re b= 1. 000) to fully-developed turbulence (Re b= 60. 000). The general features of the flow and the relative independence of the current front for Re b> 10. 000 are correctly predicted. In agreement with previous research. the spanwise two-point correlations are found to be the most useful quantities to assess the mesh resolution. In addition. velocity power spectrum densities are used to provide information on the maximum cell size required to ensure the LES filter cutoff wavelength is inside the inertial range of the turbulence spectra. We show that at low Reynolds numbers. the turbulence model is too …,True,w_8aMdgAAAAJ:K3LRdlH-MEoC,13,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045793018304407,5435845535434115922,/scholar?cites=5435845535434115922,,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/2292/43792/CandF_2018_08005_Pelmard.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0
1161024,Transition to stably stratified states in open channel flow with radiative surface heating,2015,N Williamson and SW Armfield and MP Kirkpatrick and Stuart Norris,,,,,,Direct numerical simulations of turbulent stratified flow in an open channel with an internal heat source following the Beer-Lambert law from the surface are used to investigate the transition from neutral to strongly stable flow. Our buoyancy bulk parameter is defined through the ratio of the domain height δ to L. a bulk Obukhov length scale for the flow. We cover the range λ = δ/L = 0−2.0. from neutral conditions to the onset of the stable regime. with the Reynolds number range Reτ = 200 − 800. at a Prandtl number of 0.71. The result is a boundary layer flow where the effects of stratification are weak in the wall region but progressively stronger in the outer layer up to the free surface. At λ 1 the turbulent kinetic energy budget is in local equilibrium over a region extending from the near wall region to a free surface affected region a distance lν from the surface with lν/δ ∼ Re−1/2. In this equilibrium region the flow can be characterised by the flux Richardson number Rf and the local Obukhov length scale Λ. At higher λ local mixing limit conditions are observed over an extended region. At λ = 2 the flux Richardson number approaches critical limit values of Rf.c 0.18 and gradient Richardson number Ric 0.2. At high λ. we obtain a flow field where buoyancy interacts with the smallest scales of motion the turbulent shear stress and buoyancy flux are suppressed to molecular levels. We find this regime can be identified in terms of the parameter ReL.c = Luτ /ν 200 − 400 which is related to the L∗ parameter of Flores & Riley (2011) and buoyancy Reynolds number R.

They improve the flexibility and increase the options for many applications. such as distributed power. vehicle propulsion. and portable devices. Their main property is the high electrical efficiency compared to other energy conversion devices. Both the low-temperature and the high-temperature fuel cells have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the application. Sometimes. they can both be implemented in similar applications. The modularity of fuel cells makes them quite flexible as the power needed can easily be attained by changing the number of modules. Twenty years ago. mainly universities and research institutions but only a few companies conducted fuel cell research working on the fundamentals of fuel cells. Nowadays due to the commercial interest innumerable research groups and companies have fuel cell activities ranging from the investigation of catalysts (both improving existing catalyst systems as searching for new catalysts). the development of novel membranes for PEMFCs and DMFCs. to the development of other components for fuel cells.

First. the use of improved electrocatalysts for the anode. such as PtRu alloys. can significantly enhance the CO tolerance. On the other hand. CO poisoning of the anode could be avoided by the use of non-electrochemical methods. For example. the addition of liquid hydrogen peroxide to the humidification water of the cell leads to the formation of active oxygen by decomposition of H2O2 and the oxidation of CO.

When used as an expander. a mechanism to determine the timing of the suction process in RV machine is required. In this study. a blocker-type valve is proposed for the suction control. and a simulation is carried out to investigate its friction and leakage characteristics. The valve comprises a stationary blocker that blocks high-pressure working fluid from entering the working chambers during expansion. In order to reduce friction. there should be a clearance between the rotary parts and the stationary blocker. which inevitably causes leakage of the working fluid into the working chambers.

Though it is a mature technology. the selection. sizing and optimisation of the expander used to extract energy is still an active topic of research since it can strongly affect the performance of the ORC. Among the types of volumetric expanders. the use of rotary vane expanders is advantageous. particularly in small-scale applications. due to their simplicity. low manufacturing and maintenance cost. low noise. and high volumetric expansion ratios. However. they generally perform poorly in comparison to other rotary machines because of their inevitable leakage and friction losses. leading to low efficiencies. A Revolving Vane (RV) expander. in which both the rotor and cylinder rotate. unlike conventional vane-type mechanisms. has been shown to exhibit a significant reduction in friction losses. Such a machine has been previously studied in compressed air and refrigeration systems. but not in an ORC system.In this study. the first law of thermodynamics is used to evaluate the performance of a Revolving Vane expander within an ORC system using R134a. R1234yf and R1234ze (E). The last two fluids are popular replacements for R134a. since they have low global warming and zero ozone depletion potentials.

Thus. hydrogen as a fuel can lead to global sustainability. Conventional H 2 production is predominantly through fossil fuels. and electrolysis is now identified to be most promising for H 2 generation. This review describes the recent state of the art and challenges on ultra-pure H 2 production through methanol electrolysis that incorporate polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM). It also discusses about the methanol electrochemical reforming catalysts as well as the impact of this process via PEM. The efficiency of H 2 production depends on the different components of the PEM fuel cells. which are bipolar plates. current collector. and membrane electrode assembly. The efficiency also changes with the nature and type of the fuel. fuel/oxygen ratio. pressure. temperature. humidity. cell potential. and interfacial electronic level interaction between the redox levels of electrolyte and band gap edges of the semiconductor membranes. Diverse operating conditions such as concentration of methanol. cell temperature. catalyst loading. membrane thickness. and cell voltage that affect the performance are critically addressed.

Thomas Hamacher3 1TUMCREATE Limited …,,Anthony Vautrin and Sebastian Troitzsch and Srikkanth Ramachandran and Thomas Hamacher,,,,,,The intermittency of renewable electricity generation and the increasing peak demand due to electric mobility pose challenges to the electric grid operation. Demand side flexibility (DSF) is becoming an important technique to counter these challenges. where the air-conditioning demand of commercial buildings has a particularly high potential to serve as a flexible load. This paper proposes demand controlled ventilation (DCV) as a method to increase the DSF of air-conditioned commercial buildings. Two DCV strategies are proposed based on (1) occupancy-based ventilation according to ASHRAE Standard 62.1 and (2) an indoor air quality (IAQ) model. The increase/changes in DSF are quantified for both the strategies. For a test case comprising a zone of an office building in Singapore. both DCV strategies are shown to increase the DSF when compared to a conservative ventilation strategy. For instance. the IAQ-based DCV strategy allows for scheduling strategic reserves six-fold higher than the conservative ventilation strategy.,True,o0rT2X4AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2019/BS2019_210968.pdf,,,,http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2019/BS2019_210968.pdf,0,0,0
1161165,Intermediate Temperatures Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells (IT-DEFC),,Jochen Friedl and Berthold BL Reeb and Srikkanth Ramachandran and Ulrich Stimming,,H2 & FC Systems/Applications,,16,,Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFC) have attracted rising attention in recent years. as the direct electrochemical conversion of the fuel is highly efficient and ethanol has a high energy density. Bioethanol can possibly be produced from biomass or municipal solid waste (MSW); from 1 ton of MSW 152 litres of bioethanol can be obtained1. 2. Since complete oxidation to CO2 needs to be achieved low temperature fuel cells are hardly suitable3. a DEFC should be operated at intermediate temperatures of approx. 250 C to thermally activate CC bond breaking of the ethanol molecule. For such operation temperatures new fuel cell materials have to be developed. as both Nafion™ and phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole cannot be used as membrane–and carbon as catalyst support or as the gas diffusion layer (GDL) will easily corrode. Possible membranes for these temperatures are composites of ammonium polyphosphates (APP) and metal oxides embedded in a polymer electrolytes which were recently prepared in our group4. 5. Since carbon needs to be replaced an alternative could be Nb doped SnO2 as catalyst support6. As catalyst for the EOR at temperatures below 100 C PtSn has shown good activity higher than PtRu and Pt7 which is expected to be similar at 250 C but due to the thermal activation non-noble metal catalysts can possibly be used. Regarding a DEFC stack. the cell design and thermal management of the HT-PEM can be adopted. as the difference in temperature is not large. Further. the demand on the materials is much lower as compared to a solid oxygen fuel cell (SOFC). eg stainless steel can be used for the bipolar plates.,True,o0rT2X4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,http://www.h2fcsupergen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Oral-Presentation-abstracts1.pdf#page=16,,,,http://www.h2fcsupergen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Oral-Presentation-abstracts1.pdf#page=16,0,0,0

E-learning recommenders continue to play an increasing educational role in aiding learners to find appropriate learning materials to support the achievement of their learning goals. Although general recommender systems have recorded significant success in solving the problem of information overload in e-commerce domains and providing accurate recommendations. e-learning recommender systems on the other hand still face some issues arising from differences in learner characteristics such as learning style. skill level and study level.

1161182,Modeling the RTD of an industrial overflow ball mill as a function of load volume and slurry concentration,2011,Augustine B Makokha and Michael H Moys and Mulenga M Bwalya,24,Minerals Engineering,3-4,335-340,Pergamon,The role of residence time distribution (RTD) in the accuracy of milling simulation is well appreciated in literature. Accordingly. the development of models that can accurately predict the RTD at various mill operating conditions would be of considerable benefit to the milling industry. In this paper. a 3-parameter RTD model has been derived using the concept of serial stirred mixers with a dead zone. The model parameters were optimized by minimizing the error between experimental tracer response data and model predictions using a MATLAB algorithm.

Therefore. it is imperative that they are closely monitored and controlled during mill operation to keep their levels within a predetermined safe and efficient operating range regardless of the rate at which the raw coal is fed to the mill. One way to achieve this is through a control schedule that compares the value obtained from the process to the stored set-point value to determine if there is any deviation that requires correction. This paper describes a steady state model that could be used alongside conventional controllers as an on-line shadow that provides inferential estimates of desired temperatures and pressure drops in the mill circuit which can be continuously compared with the actual values for adjustment.

Six different conditions of solids concentration and three levels of ball loading were assessed. The effects of the slurry solids concentration and the ball loading on the mean residence time of slurry were clearly depicted in the results. Using the mass balance of salt tracer inside the mill. the slurry flow rate through the mill was estimated and the calculated values compared reasonably with the measured ones within the limits of experimental error. Further. based on the measured flow rates and residence times. it was possible to estimate the slurry holdup volume inside the mill.

1161187,Measuring. characterisation and modelling of load dynamic behaviour in a wet overflow-discharge ball mill.,2011,Augustine Barasa Makokha,,,,,,Overflow ball mills have found popular application in the ore dressing process for post-primary grinding firstly owing to their ability to produce finer grinds. necessary for efficient mineral liberation and better flotation recovery and secondly due to lower initial capital outlay. However they are inefficient and intensive energy consumers. This trend has been exacerbated in the wake of increased installation of large diameter ball mills to benefit from economies of scale. coupled with diminishing ore quality currently being experienced by mines worldwide. To fully utilise the available mill capacity and achieve optimal performance whilst maintaining energy efficiency for these large devices. closer and more effective control is needed. Satisfaction of this need would result in stability of the entire mineral processing circuit. thereby reducing the overall cost in mineral extraction. Clear and deeper understanding of the in-mill behaviour is fundamental to the realisation of the above objective. This thesis explores several experimental and modelling techniques to obtain deeper understanding of the internal behaviour of an overflow ball mill. A direct load sensor comprising an inductive proximity probe and a conductivity probe installed through the mill shell has been utilised to collect information of the media and slurry dynamic positions inside a laboratory ball mill while a commercial on-line ball and pulp sensor was employed to collect similar information on an industrial overflow ball mill. Useful insights were acquired that can help the design of control strategies for optimal mill performance.

Amongst the Borana pastoralist of Northern Kenya. milk and meat production are the cornerstone of livelihood. and more often abundance occurs without possibility of immediate consumption. triggering the need to preserve surplus for future consumption. The objective of this paper is to document and understand traditional meat preparation knowledge amongst Borana pastoralist‟ s women of Northern Kenya.The method of collecting information included in-depth interviews and participant observations to document meat preparation skills and knowledge of Borana people as appertains to traditional food ways. It was observed that methods of traditional meat processing and preparation included different forms of drying. use of heat and storage in fat. Fourteen traditional meat products and seven preservation techniques were documented. Drying and deep frying were the major form of meat preservation.

To ensure that adequate slurry removal capacity is achieved while keeping the ball charge well saturated with slurry at all times (for efficient grinding). good knowledge of slurry transport inside the mill is essential. Most existing ball mill simulation models either inadequately account for the continuous exchange of slurry between the ball charge and the slurry pool or do not consider the realities such as back-mixing or bypasses in the system thereby leading to inaccurate prediction of slurry transport. To close that gap. a model is proposed here. in which both axial and radial flow parameters as well as a short-circuit component are incorporated as an improvement to the simple mixing cell model to correctly describe the inherent in-mill slurry …,True,3gLQddoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,5,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032591011002026,17466886931846428595,/scholar?cites=17466886931846428595,,,0,0,0

The efficiency of mill product discharge (which determines the capacity of the power plant). depends on the mill design and operating conditions. Presented in this paper is an investigation of the effect of liner/lifter profile on the discharge capacity of the mill product. The focus is on assessing the improvement in product discharge rate achievable by retrofitting worn liners with cone-lifters. The cases investigated were (i) bevel (45°. face angle) and (ii) bevel (45°. face angle) modified with cone-lifters. The discharge rate of the mill product was found to be 100% higher in the latter than in the former case.

Borana produce a number of traditionally preserved beef and goat meat products. Although these traditional products are widely appreciated. there is concern about their nutritional quality. especially because some of them are preserved with fats and other ingredients. Thus. the objectives of this study were to characterize the traditional meat product processes and to establish their nutrient profile and shelf life stability. Samples were collected from study sites and analyzed in the laboratory. Results showed that moisture contents ranged from 3.3 to 6.1%. crude protein contents ranged from 55.8 to 72.5% while crude fat ranged from 9.4 to 13.3%.

This paper presents the fundamental theory and the methodology for design of a single arm centrifugal reaction water turbine that would allow efficient extraction of hydro-power. Continuum mechanics approach was adopted where the design of the turbine was derived from a mathematical model that was based on the balance equations formulated in a rotating control …,True,3gLQddoAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC,0,http://41.89.160.13:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/3964,,,,,0,0,0
1161201,Single Arm. Centrifugal. Water Turbine for Low Head and Low Flow Application: Part 2-Performance Evaluation,2018,Kiplangat C Kononden and Augustine B Makokha and Sitters WM Cox,,,,,,This paper presents performance analysis of the single arm centrifugal reaction water turbine described in Part 1 of our research. Experimental tests were conducted to assess the power output and efficiency of the turbine by varying the head. orifice diameter and the arm radius. The results obtained show that; the radial arm length affects the operating angular velocity. output torque as well as the overall turbine efficiency. The turbine exhibited maximum efficiency of 83% and 40% at heads of 1.85 m and 11.5 m respectively. The corresponding ratio of cross-sectional area of nozzle to main conduit was in the range of 0.18 to 0.24. It is concluded that the semi-circular centrifugal reaction water turbine is a fairly suitable type of turbine for low head and low-medium flow application. Based on the results obtained. an arm conduit with a larger cross-sectional area would be recommendable to achieve higher discharge. But further research is still needed on how best the water from the reservoir would get into the turbine and exit.,True,3gLQddoAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,0,https://excellencecenter.mu.ac.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Prof.-Eng.-Makokha.pdf,,,,https://excellencecenter.mu.ac.ke/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Prof.-Eng.-Makokha.pdf,0,0,0
1161202,Experimental Investigation of the Thermal Performance of Kenya Defence Forces Mobile Diesel Cooker,2017,Ezra O Were and Augustine B Makokha and Charles Nzila,,Proceedings of Sustainable Research and Innovation Conference,,50-57,,Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) invented a diesel mobile field cooker (DEFKITCH) in the year 2010 capable of serving over two hundred soldiers in military camps and in operation areas (patent number KE 0642 dated 28 April 2014). The cooker was designed with three different sizes of cooking pots made of grade 304 stainless steel:(i)-24 gallon light duty with uniform wall thickness of 3 millimetres (ii)-24 gallon heavy duty with wall thickness of 3 millimetres and bottom thickness of 6 millimetres (iii)-12 gallon pot with wall thickness of 3 millimetres. The cooker was commercialized in 2012 but since then no experimental assessment had been done to ascertain its performance and emission levels. Therefore this research sought to investigate the thermal performance of the cooker by experimental assessment of the combustion and thermal efficiencies as well as the level of emission of CO and CO2. Thermal efficiency was investigated by conducting Water Boiling Tests (WBT) where parameters like heating time. temperatures and fuel consumption rate were recorded. Average thermal efficiencies computed from the results ranged from 60.37 percent to 65.86 percent using the 24 gallon cooking pots while a lower value of 42.69 percent was obtained using the 12 gallon pot on the same cooker. The average thermal efficiency was found to closely compare with those of other cookers in the open literature–ranging from 58–68 percent. Average diesel consumption per burner was found to be 0.8 litres in one hour which was found to be sufficient to prepare a meal for approximately two hundred people. Combustion efficiency of the cooker was determined …,True,3gLQddoAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,0,http://repository.mut.ac.ke:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/2829/Muriithi_Conference%20No%2039%202017_SRI_Conference_Proceedings%20%281%29%20Karue-Print%20pg%2039-44.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#page=59,,,,http://repository.mut.ac.ke:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/2829/Muriithi_Conference%20No%2039%202017_SRI_Conference_Proceedings%20%281%29%20Karue-Print%20pg%2039-44.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y#page=59,0,0,0

Fermentation process optimization is very crucial especially while using relatively low fermentable sugars substrates. In this research. banana peels derived from Ngombe cultivar were dried. ground into fine powder to pass through a 1 mm screen. and then hydrolyzed using 60% concentrated H 2 SO 4 at 50 o C. Bioethanol was produced by anaerobic fermentation of the hydrolysate using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Erlenmeyer Flasks fitted with non-return air valves were used as laboratory scale still reactors. Fermentation systems were subjected to various conditions based on half factorial Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD). Total Reducing Sugars (TRS) concentrations and bioethanol yield analyses were done by Dubois and Gas Chromatography methods respectively. Optimum bioethanol yield of 13.09 ml/L was obtained at 180 g/L substrate concentration. 35 o C fermentation temperature. 5.5 initial medium pH. 2 g/L yeast concentration. and 120 hours incubation corresponding to a TRS degradation of 30.30 g/L.

Catechol is an excellent starting material for oxidative polymerization since it contains the very reactive two hydroxyl groups in ortho-position. like other polyphenols in nature. Polymerization of catechol is known to happen under oxidative conditions or by use of a catalyst. Catechol was silylated with BSTFATMCS shortly before being analyzed by GC-MS. The results obtained indicate that catechol polymerizes immediately on its own under ambient conditions (without oxygen saturation or pH adjustment) forming a dimer and trimer. Results from ESI-MS confirm the formation of dimers and trimers. The combination of these two techniques led to the proposal of plausible molecular structures. These structures are characterized by the presence of ether-and hydroxyl functional groups. Effect of two solvents; water and methanol was investigated whereby water yielded less mass fragments in the GC-MS analysis as compared to methanol. The results obtained are of great importance since catechol is a key reagent in most of the syntheses.
