1193651,Stabilization of silver and gold nanoparticles: Preservation and improvement of plasmonic functionalities,2018,Hyunho Kang and Joseph T Buchman and Rebeca S Rodriguez and Hattie L Ring and Jiayi He and Kyle C Bantz and Christy L Haynes,119,,1,664-699,American Chemical Society,Noble metal nanoparticles have been extensively studied to understand and apply their plasmonic responses. upon coupling with electromagnetic radiation. to research areas such as sensing. photocatalysis. electronics. and biomedicine. The plasmonic properties of metal nanoparticles can change significantly with changes in particle size. shape. composition. and arrangement. Thus. stabilization of the fabricated nanoparticles is crucial for preservation of the desired plasmonic behavior. Because plasmonic nanoparticles find application in diverse fields. a variety of different stabilization strategies have been developed. Often. stabilizers also function to enhance or improve the plasmonic properties of the nanoparticles.

SARFe increased with IONP size up to a maximum of 628±11 W/g Fe for the largest IONP studied (33 nm). IONPs with a diameter> 10 nm were demonstrated to have transverse relaxivity (r2) values suitable for low-concentration IONP imaging applications. such as cell tracking. On the other hand. the optimal IONP diameter for achieving longitudinal relaxivity (r1) was dependent on magnetic field strength. Measurements of r1 values performed at a clinically relevant magnetic field (1.4 T) indicate all IONP diameters were more sensitive than gadolinium-based contrast agents (r1≥ 2.9 mMFe-1s-1) widely used in clinical imaging. However. such a large r1 was not observed when measured at a larger (pre-clinical) magnetic field (9.4 T).

1193671,Applications of Atomic Magnetometry and Hyperpolarized Xenon,2012,Hattie Lucille Ring,,,,,,Conventional nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have been exploited by scientists for everything from protein structure determination and clinical imaging. to drug synthesis and design. However. there are still several limitations. including portability. expense. and sensitivity. New methods will be described for sensitivity enhancement using xenon hyperpolarization and inexpensive low-field detection of nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR). J-coupling. and hyperpolarized xenon (hp-Xe). Low-field detection is performed with an alkali vapor atomic magnetometer which is known to be extremely sensitive at earth's magnetic field and lower. This low field sensitivity allows for detection of nucleus interactions that are normally overshadowed by the much stronger Zeeman interactions at low field. such as NQR and J-coupling interactions. Lower magnetic field detection of conventional (Zeeman) NMR interactions are problematic due to the inherent loss of polarization at low fields. Hyperpolarization techniques. such as hp-Xe. allow NMR signal to be independent of the leading field strength. Hp-Xe is explored at high fields for microfluidic rapid screening applications. and at low field to expand the applications of these techniques.,True,JIHQ7mUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/722306x0,5464897073597595242,/scholar?cites=5464897073597595242,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt722306x0/qt722306x0.pdf,0,0,0

Unfortunately. there remains an enormous gap between transplantable kidney supply and demand. This gap can potentially be filled if storage times for kidneys could be significantly extended. which would allow for more efficient donor-recipient matching. Ice-free cryopreservation in a glassy state through vitrification. is one possible approach. theoretically allowing indefinite storage.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,A series of oxazoline‐modified styrene–acrylonitrile (SAN) copolymers was prepared through the reaction of amino alcohols onto preformed SAN copolymers. Consequently. a variety of reactive copolymers were synthesized. The major focus of this study was to examine the influence of reaction conditions. i.e.. the nature of the catalyst and amino alcohol structure. on reactivity. The ability to incorporate oxazoline groups onto preformed polymers is dependent on whether homogeneous reaction conditions are met. For example. the use of nonreactive solubilizing agents. i.e.. cosolvent. is effective. However. optimum conditions are obtained when the catalyst is completely soluble in the reaction mixture containing the amino alcohol and SAN copolymer. With these restrictions. zinc stearate is quite effective.

Involvement in cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. motility. and proliferation identifies integrins as therapeutic targets in cancer and associated conditions: thrombosis. angiogenesis. and osteoporosis. The most reported strategy for drug development is synthesis of an agent that is highly selective for a single integrin receptor. However. the ability of cancer cells to change their integrin repertoire in response to drug treatment renders this approach vulnerable to the development of resistance and paradoxical promotion of tumor growth. Here. we review progress toward development of antagonists targeting two or more members of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) binding integrins. notably αvβ3. αvβ5. αvβ6. αvβ8. α5β1. and αIIbβ3. as anticancer therapeutics.,True,W_lDaEQAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,79,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm5000547,393036563408115604,/scholar?cites=393036563408115604,,https://bradscholars.brad.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10454/9984/Sheldrake_Journal_of_Medicinal_Chemistry.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The current lack of highly specific detection methods and efficient therapeutic agents for advanced disease have been identified as problems requiring further research. The integrins play a vital role in the cross-talk between the cell and extracellular matrix. enhancing the growth. migration. invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Progression and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma is strongly associated with changes in integrin expression. notably abnormal expression and activation of the β 3 integrins in tumour cells. which promotes haematogenous spread and tumour growth in bone. As such. influencing integrin cell expression and function using targeted therapeutics represents a potential treatment for bone metastasis. the most common and debilitating complication of advanced prostate cancer. In this review. we highlight the multiple ways in which RGD-binding integrins contribute to prostate cancer progression and metastasis. and identify the rationale for development of multi-integrin antagonists targeting the RGD-binding subfamily as molecularly targeted agents for its treatment.

One of the main challenges is having a relevant. validated experimental model that expresses the tumour dissemination process. The aim of the work presented here is to study the effect of the compound cRGDfV on the invasion of U87-MG cell as spheres in 3D model and as single layer in 2D model. cRGDfV inhibited U87-MG spheroid invasion through the gel in a dose and time-dependent manner. However. cRGDfV showed a significantly more potent effect on the invasion of U87-MG cells through Matrigel coated 2D transwells compared to its effect on the invasion of U87-MG cells from spheroids in collagen. The spheroid invasion assay has the advantage over standard monolayer transwell chamber invasion assays of being a 3-dimensional assay. and thus mimics better the cell-cell interactions and architecture that are present in a tumour compared to the monolayer-based assay.,True,W_lDaEQAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11710686839725196845&hl=en&oi=scholarr,11710686839725196845,/scholar?cites=11710686839725196845,,,0,0,0

Substantial research in the last few decades has provided a detailed picture of the nature and content of the tumor microenvironment. Apart from the diverse composition. the recent focus has been on the altered state of metabolism seen in the cells of the tumor microenvironment. Cancer cells show increased uptake of available nutrients. and they are also highly active in generating metabolic by-products. which creates a unique microenvironment. Such aggressive metabolism of cancer cells highly affects the viability and function of the surrounding cells. specially the immune cells. The nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment along with toxic metabolic by-products hinders immune cell activation and fosters the generation of a tolerogenic immune response. The dynamic interaction between immune cells and the tumor microenvironment has proved to be a fertile area of research. This has led to the development of immunotherapy. which has been highly successful in treating malignancies. Metabolism plays a pivotal role in determining this interaction as evident from the increasing number of studies that have emerged in this new area of immunometabolism in the tumor microenvironment. In this review. we aim to summarize the current information on the metabolic pathways operational in the tumor microenvironment and the detailed mechanisms through which the function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells get affected by the tumor cells.

Synthesis of organophosphorus compounds based on 9.10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) and its application as flame retardant have created much attention in the flame retardant community. Various chemical reactions and synthetic approaches are followed to develop numerous derivatives of DOPO. This review focuses on the recent advances in DOPO chemistry. classifying its derivatives based on the chemical reactions and functional groups. The reaction mechanisms of each specific reaction for DOPO derivatization are discussed in detail. Additionally some characteristic applications of these DOPO-derivatives with important flammability performance are also reported in this short review.,True,UFeSRm4AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,166,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391014004479,10322015948469591512,/scholar?cites=10322015948469591512,,,0,0,0

Indeed. as clearly depicted by Horrocks in a recent review. the world of flame retardants for textiles is still experiencing some changes that are focused on topics like the improvement of its effectiveness and the replacement of toxic chemical products with counterparts that have low environmental impact and. hence. are more sustainable. In this context. phosphorus-based compounds play a key role and may lead. possibly in combination with silicon-or nitrogen-containing structures. to the design of new. efficient flame retardants for fibers and fabrics. Therefore. this review thoroughly describes the advances and the potentialities offered by the phosphorus-based products recently developed at a lab-scale. highlighting the current limitations. open challenges and some perspectives toward their possible exploitation at a larger scale.

The latest development (since 2010) in organophosphorus flame retardants containing PC bonds summarized in this review. In this review. we have broadly classified such phosphorus compounds based on the carbon unit linked to the phosphorus atom ie. could be a part of either an aliphatic or an aromatic unit. We have only considered those published literature where a PC bond was created as a part of synthetic strategy to make either an intermediate or a final organophosphorus compound with an aim to use it as a flame retardant. General synthetic strategies to create PC bonds are briefly discussed. Most popular synthetic strategies used for developing PC containing phosphorus based flame retardants include Michael addition. Michaelis–Arbuzov. Friedels–Crafts and Grignard reactions. In general. most flame retardant derivatives discussed in this review have been prepared via a one-to two-step synthetic strategy with relatively high yields greater than 80%. Specific examples of PC containing flame retardants synthesized via suitable synthetic strategy and their applications on various polymer systems are described in detail. Aliphatic phosphorus compounds being liquids or low melting solids are generally applied in polymers via coatings (cellulose) or are incorporated in the bulk of the polymers (epoxy. polyurethanes) during their polymerization as reactive or non-reactive additives.

Cellulose-based fibers vary considerably in their mechanical and flammability properties depending on their chemical composition. The chemical composition of a cellulose-based fiber is further dependent on their source (ie. seed. leaf. cane. fruit. wood. bast. and grass). Being organic in nature. cellulose fibers. and their products thereof. pose considerable fire risk. In this work we have compared the flammability properties of cellulose fibers obtained from two different sources (ie. cotton and peat). Compared to cotton cellulose textiles. peat-based cellulose textiles burn longer with a prominent afterglow which can be attributed to the presence of lignin in its structure. A series of phosphoramidates were synthesized and applied on both cellulose textiles. From thermogravimetric and pyrolysis combustion flow analysis of the treated cellulose. we were able to relate the flame retardant efficacy of the synthesized phosphorus compounds to their chemical structure. The phosphoramidates with methyl phosphoester groups exhibited higher condensed phase flame retardant effects on both types of cellulose textiles investigated in this study. In addition. the bis-phosphoramidates exhibited higher flame retardant efficacy compared to the mono-phosphoramidates.

Although it is widely used in synthetic chemistry. it is normally applied in early stage functionalizations owing to poor functional group tolerance and less availability of carbonyls at late stages of molecular modifications. Herein. we report a Grignard-type reaction with alcohols as carbonyl surrogates by using a ruthenium (II) PNP-pincer complex as catalyst. This transformation proceeds via a carbonyl intermediate generated in situ from the dehydrogenation of alcohols. which is followed by a Grignard-type reaction with a hydrazone carbanion to form a CC bond. The reaction conditions are mild and can tolerate a broad range of substrates. Moreover. no oxidant is involved during the entire transformation. with only H 2 and N 2 being generated as byproducts. This reaction opens up a new avenue for Grignard-type reactions by enabling the use of …,True,nNYvA-4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,1,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19857-9,1112808827499493733,/scholar?cites=1112808827499493733,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19857-9,0,0,0

This method of catalyst stabilization alleviates the need to employ precious metals (e.g.. platinum) in liquid‐phase catalytic processing. The alumina overcoat initially covers the catalyst surface completely. By using solid state NMR spectroscopy. X‐ray diffraction. and electron microscopy. it was shown that high temperature treatment opens porosity in the overcoat by forming crystallites of γ‐Al2O3. Infrared spectroscopic measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy studies of trimethylaluminum ALD on copper show that the remarkable stability imparted to the nanoparticles arises from selective armoring of …,True,YgIQJREAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,184,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201308245,9288749221597652711,/scholar?cites=9288749221597652711,,,0,0,0

Catalytic activities for both CO hydrogenolysis and dehydration were observed to decrease with an increase in pretreatment temperature from 393 to 723 K. which coincides with a decrease in the number of sites quantified using NH3 temperature-programmed desorption. Results for the characterization of RhRe/C using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are consistent with the formation of Rh-rich particles with a shell of metallic Re islands after reduction at 393 K. which shows penetration of Re into the nanoparticle with increasing reduction temperature. No evidence of rhenium oxide was found from the Re LIII-edge XAS spectra after reduction at temperatures above 363 K or under aqueous operando conditions.

TEM. XPS and XAS spectroscopy. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicates the catalyst consists of bimetallic nano-particles with a Pt rich core and a Mo rich surface. XAS of adsorbed CO indicates that approximately 25% of the surface atoms are Pt.

Cu supported on calcined hydrotalcites (HT) was found to be the optimal catalyst for the ABE condensation. This catalyst gave a six-fold increase in reaction rates over previously reported catalysts. Kinetic analysis of the reaction over CuHT and HT revealed that the rate-determining step is the C-H bond activation of alkoxides that are formed from alcohols on the Cu surface. This step is followed by the addition of the resulting aldehydes to an acetone enolate formed by deprotonation of the acetone over basic sites on the HT surface.

This approach allows the size of the copper nanoparticles to be monitored continuously versus time‐on‐stream. such that these changes in dispersion can be accounted for in the calculation of turnover frequency. It is shown that sintering of the copper nanoparticles is the predominant mode of catalyst deactivation for a Cu/γ‐Al2O3 catalyst throughout its time‐on‐stream. leading to irreversible loss of catalytic activity.

Comparison of screens for negative. attenuating and positive regulators of WNT signaling. mediators of R-spondin-dependent signaling and suppressors of constitutive signaling induced by loss of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli or casein kinase 1α uncovered new regulatory features at most levels of the pathway.

We now show that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as alternative co-receptors for RSPO3 using a combination of ligand mutagenesis and ligand engineering. Mutations in RSPO3 residues predicted to contact HSPGs impair its signaling capacity. Conversely. the HSPG-binding domains of RSPO3 can be entirely replaced with an antibody that recognizes heparan sulfate (HS) chains attached to multiple HSPGs without diminishing WNT-potentiating activity in cultured cells and intestinal organoids.

These substances are biologically active compounds that mainly suffer early degradation in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and physicochemical instability. inactivation and poor solubility and permeability. The sensibility of the biomolecules has limited their oral administration in the body and today is an important research topic to achieve desired effects in medicine field. Under this perspective. various enhancement approaches have been studied as alternatives to increase their oral bioavailability. Some of these strategies include functionalized polymers to provide specific useful benefits as protection to the intestinal tract by preventing its degradation by stomach enzymes. to increase their absorption. permeability. stability. and to make a proper release in the GIT. Due to specific chemical groups. shapes and sizes. morphologies. mechanical properties. and degradation. recent advances in functionalized polymers have opened the door to great possibilities to improve the physicochemical characteristics of these biopharmaceuticals. Today. many biomolecules are found in basic studies. preclinical steps. and others are late stage clinical development. This review summarizes the contribution of functionalized polymers to enhance oral bioavailability of sensitive molecules and their application status in medicine for different diseases. Future trends of these polymers and their possible uses to achieve different formulation goals for oral delivery are also covered in this manuscript.

One of its main functions is to control the appearance of weeds in crops. primarily in corn. sorghum. sugar cane. and wheat; however. it is very toxic for numerous species. including humans. Therefore. this work deals with the adsorption of ATZ from aqueous solutions using nanocomposite materials. synthesized with two different types of organo-modified clays. Those were obtained by the free radical polymerization of 4-vinylpyridine (4VP) and acrylamide (AAm) in different stoichiometric ratios. using tetrabutylphosphonium persulfate (TBPPS) as a radical initiator and N. N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS) as cross-linking agent. The structural. morphological. and textural characteristics of clays. copolymers. and nanocomposites were determined through different analytical and instrumental techniques. ie. X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Adsorption kinetics experiments of ATZ were determined with the modified and synthesized materials. and the effect of the ratio between 4VP and AAm moieties on the removal capacities of the obtained nanocomposites was evaluated. Finally. from these sets of experiments. it was demonstrated that the synthesized nanocomposites with higher molar fractions of 4VP obtained the highest removal percentages of ATZ.

Knowledge of their use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is limited. A survey was conducted to determine their TCM use and to evaluate physician awareness of these practices. Methods: Structured interviews were conducted with 198 Chinese immigrant patients. and a survey was administered to 17 physicians in two federally funded community health clinics. Results: Nearly 100% of the patients had used TCM during the previous year. mostly for musculoskeletal or abdominal pain. fatigue. and health maintenance. Self-medication with herbal products was the most common (93% at least once. 43% weekly). A smaller number (23%) had used herbs prescribed by a TCM provider. Use of acupuncture was less common (14%). although higher than the national average. Most patients indicated a preference to consult Western physicians for acute infections. Only 5% reported that their physicians had ever asked about their use of TCM. By contrast. 77% of physicians reported that they “usually or sometimes” asked about TCM use. Conclusions: Results suggest that these patients used TCM. primarily self-prescribed over-the-counter herbal preparations. for many health problems. Information about use was not shared with their physicians. nor did patients perceive their doctors as soliciting sufficient information on TCM use.

Technology for non-invasively quantifying CSF flow would allow for precise localization of injury and assist in evaluating the viability of certain devices placed in the central nervous system (CNS). We describe a near-infrared fluorescent dye for accurately monitoring CSF flow by positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorescence. IR-783. a commercially available near-infrared dye. was chemically modified and radiolabeled with fluorine-18 to give [18F]-IR783-AMBF3. [18F]-IR783-AMBF3 was intrathecally injected into the rat models with normal and aberrant CSF flow and evaluated by the fluorescence and PET/MRI or PET/CT imaging modes. IR783-AMBF3 was clearly distributed in CSF-containing volumes by PET and fluorescence. We compared IR783-AMBF3 (fluorescent at 778/793 nm. ex/em) to a shorter-wavelength. fluorescein equivalent (fluorescent at 495/511 nm. ex/em). IR783-AMBF3 was superior for its ability to image through blood (hemorrhage) and for imaging CSF-flow. through-skin. in subdural-run lumboperitoneal shunts. IR783-AMBF3 was safe under the tested dosage both in vitro and in vivo.

Further. they were evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxicity activity against different pathogenic microbes (Escherichia coli. Bordetella bronchiseptica. Staphylococcus aureus. and Bacillus subtilis) and HeLa cancerous cells. Synthesized NAPs were also investigated for photocatalytic dye degradation potential against methylene blue (MB). and adsorption activity against Cr (VI) was also determined. Results from Scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX). and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the successful synthesis of NAPs with spherical morphology and crystalline nature. Biological activity results demonstrated that synthesized AI-MnO NAPs exhibited significant antibacterial and cytotoxicity propensities against pathogenic microbes and cancerous cells. respectively. compared with plant extract. Moreover. synthesized AI-MnO NAPs demonstrated the comparable biological activities results to standard drugs. These excellent biological activities results are attributed to the existence of the plant’s biological molecules on their surfaces and small particle size (synergetic effect). Synthesized NAPs displayed better MB-photocatalyzing properties under sunlight than an ultraviolet lamp. The Cr (VI) adsorption result showed that synthesized NAPs efficiently adsorbed more Cr (VI) at higher acidic pH than at basic pH. Hence. the current findings suggest that Abutilon indicum is a valuable source for tailoring the potential of NAPs toward various …,True,pX-IsNIAAAAJ:maZDTaKrznsC,10,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/5/785,7720811472357355997,/scholar?cites=7720811472357355997,,https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/5/785/pdf,0,0,0

Inc.,Friedel-Crafts acetylation of 9H-fluorene is an effective route for the preparation of mono-and diacetyl-9H-fluorenes. Using acetylchloride as the reagent and aluminum chloride as the Lewis acid catalyst the effect of the solvent polarity. the temperature. the reaction time and the mode of addition (Perrier or Bouveault) on the reactivity-selectivity pattern was investigated. The results showed that monoacetylation of 9H-fluorene in chloroalkanes and nitromethane gives mixtures of 2-acetyl-and 4-acetyl-9H-fluorene with the former dominating. In addition to these two isomers. 2. 7-diacetyl-9H-fluorene was obtained in 5-11% yield when carbon disulfide was used as the solvent. Acetylation of 9H-fluorene in dichloroethane and carbon disulfide. using an excess of acetyl chloride and aluminum chloride at reflux temperature. gives 2. 7-diacetyl-9H-fluorene exclusively in high yields (> 97%). Attempts to carry out diacetylation in nitromethane on the other hand resulted in the formation of monoacetyl derivatives only. The ketones obtained were isolated and identified by various physico-chemical techniques. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4-acetyl-9H-fluorene is reported for the first time. Values of the total energies and the Gibbs free energies at 298K for 9H-fluorene. the five isomeric monoacetyl-9H-fluorenes and the four σcomplexes leading to 1-. 2-. 3-and 4-acetyl-9H-fluorene. respectively. were computed at the DFT B3LYP 6-31G** level of theory.

In this work. we report on the design and synthesis of new semiconducting quaterthiophene incorporating hexyl thiol group (4TT). Gold nanoparticles capped with 4TT (4TTG) were prepared in a two-phase liquid-liquid system. These nanoparticles have diameters in the range 2–6 nm and are well dispersed in the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) host matrix. The intermolecular interaction between 4TT and P3HT could enhance the charge-transport between gold nanoparticles and P3HT. Transfer curve of transistor memory device made of 4TTG/P3HT hybrid film exhibited significant current hysteresis. probably arising from the energy level barrier at 4TTG/P3HT interface.

In this paper. we present the results of boron-rich compound (carborane borate) attachment to previously aminated by (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane (APTMS) iron oxide NPs. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with Attenuated total reflectance accessory (ATR-FTIR) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis confirmed the change of the element content of NPs after modification and formation of new bonds between Fe 3 O 4 NPs and the attached molecules. Transmission (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed Fe 3 O 4 NPs’ average size of 18.9 nm. Phase parameters were studied by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). and the magnetic behavior of Fe 3 O 4 NPs was elucidated by Mössbauer spectroscopy. The colloidal and chemical stability of NPs was studied using simulated body fluid (phosphate buffer—PBS). Modified NPs have shown excellent stability in PBS (pH= 7.4). characterized by XRD. Mössbauer spectroscopy. and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Biocompatibility was evaluated in-vitro using cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The results show us an increasing of IC 50 from 0.110 mg/mL for Fe 3 O 4 NPs to 0.405 mg/mL for Fe 3 O 4-Carborane NPs. The obtained data confirm the biocompatibility and stability of synthesized NPs and the potential to use them in BNCT.

Due to their common structural features. many compounds within the same class undergo similar MS/MS fragmentation and have several identical product ions and/or neutral losses. The purpose of diagnostic fragmentation filtering (DFF) is to efficiently detect all compounds of a given class in a complex extract by screening non-targeted LC-MS/MS datasets for MS/MS spectra that contain class specific product ions and/or neutral losses. This method is based on a DFF module implemented within the open-source MZmine platform that requires sample extracts be analyzed by data-dependent acquisition on a high-resolution mass spectrometer such as quadrupole Orbitrap or quadrupole time-of-flight mass analyzers. The main limitation of this approach is the analyst must first define which product ions and/or neutral losses are specific for the targeted class of natural products.

Sequence specific gene reduction by siRNA represents an attractive approach to modulate macrophage function. However. delivery of the therapeutic siRNA into macrophages by non-viral nanoparticles has been a major technical challenge. In this study. we developed a glucan-based siRNA carrier system (BG34-10-Re-I) and demonstrated that the BG34-10-Re-I can effectively assemble siRNA into uniformly distributed nanoparticles of the novel core-shell structure.

The complex releases one Cl− producing cis-[RuCl(OH)(cyclen)]+ in aqueous solution at pH 4.60. The product of this reaction was characterized by Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) spectrum in comparison to the synthesized cis-[RuCl(OH)(cyclen)](BF4)·2H2O. The electrochemical data showed that Epc of the Ru(III/II) peak increases as the macrocycle ring size decreases and also when the trans conformation is changed to cis. The chloride affinity of Ru(III) depends on the macrocycle ring size since cis-[RuCl2(cyclam)]+ (cyclam=1.4.8.11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) does not release chloride for at least 12 h.

Different pathways for OH radical additions to the benzene ring sites and H-atom abstractions are explored in details. At 200 K. the oxidation mechanism of OTOD is thoroughly dominated by the OH-addition to the aromatic ring. whereas the main favorable route is the OH addition to C2 atom with a branching ratio of 52.76%. Raising temperature to 1000 K. the total abstraction of amine's hydrogens becomes the main oxidation pathway for OTOD with contributions of 29.29%. The atmospheric lifetimes of aniline and OTOD are calculated to be 20.74 and 11.23 min.. respectively.

Our approach employs a femtosecond ultraviolet (UV) laser pulse with specific linear polarization achieving selective photodissociation of one enantiomer from a mixture of L and R enantiomers. As a result. the selected enantiomer is destroyed in the electronically excited state while the opposite enantiomer is left intact in the ground state. As an example we use H2POSD which presents axial chirality. A UV pulse excites the lowest singlet excited state which has nσ* character and is. therefore. strongly repulsive along the P–S bond.

In particular. for monolayers on both gold and silver. carboxylic acid-terminated SAMs oxidize significantly faster than methyl-terminated SAMs. in contrast to earlier observations for monolayers exposed to light from a mercury arc lamp.

Whereas the C–C scission with the loss of CO2 is usually exothermic. the C–S scission with the loss of SO2 is generally endothermic. However. two factors can make the C–S scissions thermodynamically favorable: increased entropy. characteristic for the dissociative processes. and stereoelectronic influences of substituents. The threshold between endergonic and exergonic C–S fragmentations depends on subtle structural effects. In particular. the degree of fluorination in a radical precursor has a notable impact on the reaction outcome.

The regiochemical outcomes have observable and predictable trends associated with the substituent patterns on the pyridinium electrophile. Often. the substituent effects can be either additive. giving high selectivities. or ablative. giving competing outcomes. Additionally. the nature of the organometallic nucleophilic component was also investigated for its role in the regioselective outcome. The effects of either reactive component are important to both the overall reactivity and site of nucleophilic addition.

1194469,Total Synthesis of Picrinine,2015,Joel Michael Smith,,,,,,Throughout history. organisms have ensured their survival by producing a wide variety of small molecule natural products. These entities commonly serve roles in cell function and signaling. and have also provided a defense system to combat infectious parasites. In the realm of synthetic chemistry. natural products serve as an architectural inspiration for the development of novel chemical transformations and molecular cascade processes. Ultimately. the synthesis of natural products that have biological importance holds promise toward the understanding of a plethora of biochemical pathways and the treatment of disease.  This dissertation describes synthetic efforts toward the alkaloid picrinine. This molecule is a member of the akuammiline alkaloid class. and it bears a complex molecular scaffold unaddressed by synthetic chemistry. Central to the synthetic approach is the use of the Fischer indolization reaction as a platform for rapidly building molecular complexity and constructing the salient furanoindoline core of picrinine. The earlier part of this dissertation describes a first-generation approach to the synthesis of picrinine. while the ensuing chapter concerns a second-generation route. which resulted in its total synthesis. This dissertation's final section concerns the development of a unified and enantioselective approach to the akuammiline alkaloid family. in addition to a formal enantioselective synthesis of both aspidophylline A and picrinine. In summary. the synthetic endeavors described emphasize the importance natural products hold for the development of novel synthetic strategies and transformations.,True,_CeP68UAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6d93p334,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6d93p334/qt6d93p334.pdf,0,0,0

The spectroscopic profiles reveal different sequences of side-chain movement during the chromic transitions. The gradual hypsochromic shift and reversibility of the purple solution at low temperature in the thermochromic transition indicates that the transition starts with reversible conformational alteration of methylene side chains leading to metastable purple vesicles. Further heating to 80 °C or higher eventually causes the hydrogen bonds at the carboxylic head groups to break and turns the vesicle solution to red.

Due to the limitations of conventional banding analysis in precisely identifying these rearrangements and marker chromosomes. genetic counselling is exceedingly difficult. Microdissection combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (micro-FISH) has become a powerful tool in clinical genetics for the characterization of cytogenetically unclassifiable aberrations. Micro-FISH was used to elucidate the chromosomal origin of two different de novo structural chromosome abnormalities. Ten copies of aberrant chromosomes were collected with microneedles from patient’s metaphases. transferred to a collecting drop and amplified by means of degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR). The PCR products were labeled by nick-translation with digoxigenin-11-dUTP and used as FISH probes. They were hybridized to metaphase spreads from patients to confirm the specificity of the probe and normal metaphases to determine the origin of the aberrant chromosomes. With this strategy. a de novo marker chromosome and a de novo isodicentric chromosome in peripheral blood samples were successfully identified in two cases. One marker of a small ring chromosome appeared to be derived from the pericentromeric region on the short arm and long arm (Xp11. 1-q12) of the X chromosome and the second aberrant was identified as an isodicentric X chromosome (idic (X)(q28)).

1194511,Catalytic Upgrading of Acetal-Functionalized Sugars and Lignin Oligomers,2019,Jeremy Luterbacher and Ydna Questell and Wu Lan and Graham Dick,,2019 North American Catalysis Society Meeting,,,NAM,The depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass constituents such as cellulose. hemicellulose and lignin to sugars or phenyl propanoid monomers is often considered to be the first step to producing chemicals from biomass. However. during depolymerization. several dehydration and repolymerization reactions–notably those producing humins from sugars and condensed lignin–limit yields and create significant quantities of byproduct that coat reactors and catalysts. We have recently proposed a strategy to prevent these unwanted reactions by fractionating biomass in the presence of aldehydes. This leads to the formation of acetal functionalities that block dehydration reactions. which are the first step in the repolymerization process (Fig. 1A) 1–3. In addition to preventing degradation. acetal functionalization can be used to form new platform molecules from biomass in a single fractionation step. Here. I will present how acetal functionalized sugars (Fig. 1A. 1 and 2) and lignin oligomers (3) display unique reactivity during acid-catalyzed and metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions in both batch and flow conditions.,True,ZkMmZecAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper20198/AbstractLuterbacherNACS_2.pdf,,,,https://nam.confex.com/nam/2019/mediafile/ExtendedAbstract/Paper20198/AbstractLuterbacherNACS_2.pdf,0,0,0

UV-visible spectroscopy and electrochemical experiments indicated weak orbital coupling of the two quinoxalinyl units but minimal orbital coupling between the two porphyrins. The weak electronic communication is attributed to non-planarity. on average. of the molecule because of rotation about the inter-quinoxalinyl connection. This. combined with poor coupling across the fused junctions between the porphyrin and quinoxalinyl units. results in minimal inter-porphyrin communication.

The charge-shifted state decays via back electron transfer (BET) to the ground state rather than to the triplet excited state. The BET rate was determined from the disappearance of the absorption band at 750 nm due to ZnPQ+ in ZnPQ+–AuPQ. The decay of the absorption band obeys first-order kinetics. The k BET value in cyclohexane is determined as 1.0× 10 5 s− 1. which corresponds to a lifetime of 10μs. whereas the lifetime becomes much shorter (250 ps) in …,True,hIGORPIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010406000838,17989401200298234544,/scholar?cites=17989401200298234544,,,0,0,0

Maize stalk fibres were chemically modified with acetic anhydride (acetylation) to enhance their compatibility with the hydrophobic rubber polymer matrix. The fibre was characterised using FTIR showing a spectrum with a well defined peak at 1742 cm-1 (attributed to the carbonyl groups–C= O). indicating that new acetyl groups were introduced to cellulose. The curing and physico–mechanical properties of the composite as a function of filler loading was determined and compared with the values obtained using commercial grade hydrated silica. The natural rubber-maize stalk filled composites showed good processing safety in terms of torques and scorch. Compared with untreated maize-natural rubber composites. the acetylated composites exhibited higher mechanical properties. reduced moisture absorption and higher resistant to hydrothermal aging. Based on mechanical properties and statistical treatment of data. composites filled with 20 phr treated maize stalk had the optimum set of mechanical properties (tensile strength of 22.4 MPa. elongation at break 404% and hardness Shore A of 55) that were closely comparable with commercial hydrated silica filled composites.

Recent research has focused on the use of environmentally friendly oxidants such as oxygen [1. 2] to replace stoichiometric toxic heavy metal oxidants such as dichromate and permanganates [3. 4] in organic reactions. Hydrogen peroxide has in recent years become an increasingly important oxidant in chemical transformations involving organic reactions [5]. Hydrogen peroxide is a unique oxidant since it produces water as the only byproduct. In certain organic reactions. hydrogen peroxide is a better oxidant than oxygen since some oxygen/organic mixtures may spontaneously ignite [6].

The system is developed using Raspberry Pi 3b+model and it integrates multiple sensors such as resistive soil moisture sensor. temperature and humidity sensor along with a water sprinkler unit. Daily life application is the motivation behind the present work. So a smart and automated irrigation system is designed here which is capable of automatically turning on or off the motor depending on certain parameters such as soil moisture content. environmental temperature. and humidity. To make it a low cost system. an Arduino board is used here in serial mode to interface the soil moisture sensor instead of A/D converter unit. An observation table is presented for different soil condition testing.,True,q_SR1jkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4932-8_27,,,,,0,0,0

1194642,Trichogin analogs for retinal drug delivery,,Marta De Zotti and Ivan Guryanov and Tatiana Tennikova and Madhushree Bhattacharya and Arto Urtti,,,,,,In ophthalmology retinal drug therapy is one of the major challenges. because it is hampered by ineffective and/or short-acting drug delivery to the targets [1]. Often these targets are located in intracellular compartments and there is a need of drug delivery systems able to transfer pharmaceutical cargo into retinal cells [2. 3]. Many retinal therapeutics are based on proteins and oligonucleotides with poor cell permeability. The development of cell penetrating carriers of farmaceutical cargos can noticeably enhance their therapeutic effect. From this point of view membrane-active trichogin analogs are very promising candidates as components of retinal drug delivery systems [4]. The main disadvantage of thichogin as a cell penetrating peptide (CPP) is its low solubility in aqueous media. In order to increase water solubility. we introduced lysine or 4-aminopiperidine-4-carboxylic acid (Api) residues into the trichogin sequence at different positions (Table 1).,True,q_SR1jkAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Guryanov2/publication/330505159_Trichogin_analogs_for_retinal_drug_delivery/links/5ff88fb1a6fdccdcb83ec8d2/Trichogin-analogs-for-retinal-drug-delivery.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivan_Guryanov2/publication/330505159_Trichogin_analogs_for_retinal_drug_delivery/links/5ff88fb1a6fdccdcb83ec8d2/Trichogin-analogs-for-retinal-drug-delivery.pdf,0,0,0

Given questions regarding the reliability of modeling RNA structure and dynamics with current methods. we have begun to use RNA tetranucleotides to evaluate force fields. These systems. though small. display considerable conformational variability and complete sampling with standard simulation methods remains challenging.

Enhanced sampling techniques are often applied to provide faster convergence than is possible with traditional molecular dynamics simulations.

Several X-ray crystallography studies have revealed flipped conformations of nucleotides bound to enzymes. However. little is known about the base-flipping process itself. even less about the role of the enzymes. Computational studies have used umbrella sampling to elicit the free energy profile of the base-flipping process using a pseudodihedral angle to represent the reaction coordinate.

Mg2+ ions associate with SLV when it is part of the junction in a manner similar to when it is unbound. but there is no specificity in Mg2+ binding for the SLI loop.

Most mAbs are produced in mammalian cells. but several mAbs are made in Escherichia coli. including therapeutic fragments. The NISTmAb is a well-characterized reference material made widely available to facilitate the development of both originator biologics and biosimilars. Here. when expressing NISTmAb from codon-optimized constructs in E. coli (eNISTmAb). a truncated variant of its heavy chain was observed. N-terminal protein sequencing and mutagenesis analyses indicated that the truncation resulted from an internal translation initiation from a GTG codon (encoding Val) within eNISTmAb. Using computational and biochemical approaches. we demonstrate that this translation initiates from a weak Shine–Dalgarno sequence and is facilitated by a putative ribosomal protein S1-binding site.

Dunkers,,Soft Matter,,,,Despite their great promise as fluorescent biological probes and sensors. the structure and dynamics of Ag complexes derived from single stranded DNA (ssDNA) are less understood than their double stranded counterparts. In this work. we seek new insights into the structure of single AgNssDNA clusters using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations (MD) of a fluorescent (AgNssDNA)8+ nanocluster. The results suggest that the purified (AgNssDNA)8+ nanocluster is a mixture of predominantly Ag15 and Ag16 species that prefer two distinct long-lived conformational states: one extended. the other approaching spherical.

In this work. we assess the 3D structure of the 5′ untranslated region of its RNA. in the hopes that stable secondary structures can be targeted. interrupted. or otherwise measured. To this end. we have combined molecular dynamics simulations with previous Nuclear Magnetic Resonance measurements for stem loop 2 of SARS-CoV-1 to refine 3D structure predictions of that stem loop. We find that relatively short sampling times allow for loop rearrangement from predicted structures determined in absence of water or ions. to structures better aligned with experimental data. We then use molecular dynamics to predict the refined structure of the transcription regulatory leader sequence (TRS-L) region which includes stem loop 3. and show that arrangement of the loop around exchangeable monovalent potassium can interpret the conformational equilibrium determined by in-cell dimethyl sulfate (DMS) data.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,It can be computationally expensive to compute smooth. well resolved. optical rotation (OR) dispersion (ORD) curves from first principles theory. Instead of computing the OR at a large number of frequency points. similar results can be obtained by combined use of a computed circular dichroism (CD) spectrum along with a few OR calculations by using subtractive Kramers‐Kronig transformations. We have tested various subtractive schemes for simulated (analytical) CD/ORD and for time‐dependent density functional computations for dimethyloxirane. fenchone. and [4]triangulane. Nonresonant ORD can be obtained with as few as two OR and one CD calculation. For resonant ORD we found that between 7 and 15 OR computations plus the CD spectrum were typically sufficient. depending on the number of excitations within the frequency window of interest.

Once symmetry is broken and a handedness is established. biochemical pathways are set. In DNA. the double helix arises from the existence of two competing length scales. one set by the distance between monomers in the sugar backbone. and the other set by the stacking of the base pairs 1. Here we use a colloidal system to explore a simple forcing route to chiral structures. To do so we have designed magnetic colloids that. depending on both their shape and induced magnetization. self-assemble with controlled helicity. We model the two length scales with asymmetric colloidal dumbbells linked by a magnetic belt at their waist. In the presence of a magnetic field the belts assemble into a chain and the steric constraints imposed by the asymmetric spheres force the chain to coil.

Molecules of Cu3Cl3 and Cu4Cl4 were present at the lower temperature (689 K). while dimeric molecules (Cu2Cl2) were found in addition to the trimers and tetramers at the higher temperature (1333 K). All CunCln species were found to have planar rings by both experiment and computation. The bond lengths from electron diffraction (rg) at 689 K are 2.166±0.008 Å and 2.141±0.008 Å and the Cu‐Cl‐Cu bond angles are 73.9±0.6° and 88.0±0.6° for the trimer and the tetramer. respectively.

Primary products upon reacting Au+ with C6H6 are due to charge transfer to afford C6H6+· concomitant with neutral gold as well as ligand association to yield the Au(C6H6)+ complex. Subsequent reactions of so-formed Au(C6H6)+ with benzene result in exclusive formation of the corresponding bisligated complex Au(C6H6)2+. In contrast to a previous report by Ho and Dunbar [Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 182/183 (1999) 175]. occurrence of charge transfer from benzene to Au(C6H6)+ affording C6H6+· concomitant with neutral Au(C6H6) is rigorously excluded. Our results are supported by ab initio calculations which predict a strong interaction in the Au(C6H6)+ cation. whereas neutral Au(C6H6) is best described as a loose van der Waals complex; i.e. D0(Au+–C6H6) = 61.1 kcal/mol …,True,eOChnLsAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,37,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1387380600003171,4662988628495187893,/scholar?cites=4662988628495187893,,,0,0,0

The calculations reveal that relativistic effects stabilize the higher oxidation state of gold as expected. that is Au2I6 is thermodynamically stable at the relativistic level. whilst at the nonrelativistic level the complex of two iodine molecules weakly bound to both gold atoms in Au2I2 is energetically preferred. The rather low stability of AuI3 with respect to dissociation into AuI and I2 will make it difficult to isolate this species in the solid state as (possibly) Au2I6 or detect it by matrix‐isolation techniques. The monomer AuI3 is Jahn–Teller distorted from the ideal trigonal planar (D3h) form. but adopts a Y‐shaped structure (in contrast to AuF3 and AuCl3). and in the nonrelativistic case can be described as I2 weakly …,True,eOChnLsAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,35,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1521-3765(20010716)7:14%3C3167::AID-CHEM3167%3E3.0.CO;2-G,2768413126444266887,/scholar?cites=2768413126444266887,,,0,0,0

1194799,A Theoretical Investigation of Group 11 Halides,2001,J Reuben Brown,,,,,,A set of spectroscopic constants for the group 11 diatomic halides is presented. calculated using a variety of density functional and ab-initio methods. Selected structural. spectroscopie and energetic properties for the smaller MnXn (n=2-4) clusters of the group 11 are also calculated using the Becke-Perdew-Wang functional. Trends of properties and bonding are analysed. It is found that the diatiomic molecules are ionic. with properties that can be rationalised using electrostatic models. However they also possess a smaller amount of covalent bonding due to metal-ligand orbital overlap. The bond properties of the clusters are similar to those of the diatomics with the difference that the smaller clusters (dimmers) have metal-metal interactions. At the density functional level these interactions are not like metallophillic interactions and instead have properties that are intermediate to dative and ionic bonds. A study of the relative accuracy and errors of the pseudopotential method is performed by comparing some spectroscopic properties of AuH calculated using scalar all-electron and scalar pseudopotential methods. Estimates of the average errors for the relativistic pseudopotentials. with respect to the all-electron results. are 0.003 A for bond lengths and 0.05 eV for dissociation energies. Both errors are substantially less than the uncertainties due to basis set superposition errors and incompleteness. From this it is concluded that the use of pseudopotentials does not introduce any significant errors. when they are used in place of equivalent all electron methods. The structures of Cu3Cl3 and Cu4Cl4 are derived using gas electron diffraction and found …,True,eOChnLsAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,1,https://researchspace.auckland.ac.nz/handle/2292/687,2678260434767773738,/scholar?cites=2678260434767773738,,,0,0,0

Due to the small dimensions of iron filling in these samples they have some of the highest values of magnetization saturation reported for Fe@CNTs. Magnetic characterization of the Fe@CNTs revealed that their coercivity can be systematically tuned by varying the pyrolysis temperature. whereas the saturation magnetization can be significantly enhanced by optimization of the sublimation temperature. The rate of argon flow is seen to have little influence on either the saturation magnetization or the coercivity.

Such polymer conjugates have been previously demonstrated to have high avidity to folate binding protein. However. the lack of a monovalent folic acid–polymer material has prevented a full binding analysis of these conjugates. as multivalent binding mechanisms and polymer-mass mechanisms are convoluted in samples with broad distributions of folic acid-to-dendrimer ratios. In this work. the synthesis of a monovalent folic acid–dendrimer conjugate allowed the elucidation of the mechanism for increased binding between the folic acid–polymer conjugate and a folate binding protein surface. The increased avidity is due to a folate-keyed interaction between the dendrimer and protein surfaces that fits into the general framework of slow-onset. tight-binding mechanisms of ligand/protein interactions.,True,kANEadMAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,59,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/mp5000967,13253819385980347581,/scholar?cites=13253819385980347581,,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/mp5000967,0,0,0

Mounting evidence has demonstrated that over-expression of uPA/uPAR can be found in a variety of cancer cells along with tumor-associated stromal cells. and their expression is closely associated with cancer progression and metastasis. The uPA system is almost undetectable in healthy. quiescent tissue making it an attractive target for cancer imaging/therapy. Our goal is to utilize the uPA system as a universal cancer detection marker and develop a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging of uPA/uPAR in various cancer types.

1194859,Photophyiscal and Biological Implications of the Fluorophore Polymer Ratio.,2015,Casey A Dougherty,,,,,,Multivalent polymers can be used as gene delivery vectors. diagnostics. and therapeutics when they are conjugated with small molecules.  The random nature of attaching small molecule ligands to a polymer leads to a large mixture of different ratios that can be approximated by one or more Poisson distributions. The variety of ligand to polymer ratios leads to a large difference in hydrophobic character. which can alter biological properties. The hydrophobicity ratio has been known to effect the polymer’s behavior in solution and cell. The exact effect of this ratio was determined using precise ratio materials isolated. The precise ratio of fluorophores on a polymer is specifically of interest because of the environmental dependence on fluorophore properties. The precise ratios of a fluorophore on a polymer also provides a model system for understanding how changes in hydrophobicity alter a multivalent polymer’s biological behavior. Precise dye-polymer ratios of fluorescein and TAMRA were obtained on an acetylated G5 PAMAM dendrimer by using semi-prep rp-HPLC. The fluorescein-G5 conjugates were obtained by cycloaddition of an azide functionalized fluorescein molecule with a precise ratio of cyclooctyne ligands on a G5 PAMAM dendrimer. The TAMRA-G5 PAMAM conjugates were obtained by direct conjugation and isolation. Both sets of materials were fully characterized. Amine-terminated G3 PAMAM dendrimers with precise ratios of TAMRA were also obtained and fully characterized.

However. this capping agent often remains present on the nanoparticles during catalytic reaction. and the effect of this coating on catalysis is an important question that will influence the future applications of colloidal nanoparticles. In this study. the structure of poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) ligands on Pt nanoparticles is probed using sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy before and after cap removal by UV light. When the PVP is removed. carbonaceous fragments remain on the surface that dynamically restructure in H2 and O2.

A proposed mechanism for this strong metal–support interaction is electronic activation of surface adsorbates by charge carriers. Motivated by the goal of using electronic activation to drive nonthermal chemistry. we investigated the ability of the oxide support to mediate charge transfer. We report an approximately 2-fold increase in the turnover rate of catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation on platinum nanoparticles supported on stoichiometric titanium dioxide (TiO2) when the TiO2 is made highly n-type by fluorine (F) doping. However. for nonstoichiometric titanium oxide (TiOX<2) the effect of F on the turnover rate is negligible.

The SFG data indicate that crotonaldehyde adsorbs on the oxide surface. likely through the aldehyde oxygen as well as on the Pt surface through the alkene group. AP-XPS results show that the surface of the Co3O4 support becomes partially reduced under the reaction conditions and Pt exists in its metallic state. Taking these results together. we propose that the crotonaldehyde adsorbs at reduced oxide surface sites and that this adsorption mode is responsible for the production of alcohol products.

1194927,Support Effects in Catalysis Studied by in-situ Sum Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy and in-situ X-Ray Spectroscopies,2016,Griffin John Kennedy,,,,,,Kinetic measurements are paired with in-situ spectroscopic characterization tools to investigate colloidally based. supported Pt catalytic model systems in order to elucidate the mechanisms by which metal and support work in tandem to dictate activity and selectivity. The results demonstrate oxide support materials. while inactive in absence of Pt nanoparticles. possess unique active sites for the selective conversion of gas phase molecules when paired with an active metal catalyst. In order to establish a paradigm for metal-support interactions using colloidally synthesized Pt nanoparticles the ability of the organic capping agent to inhibit reactivity and interaction with the support must first be assessed. Pt nanoparticles capped by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP). and those from which the PVP is removed by UV light exposure. are investigated for two reactions. the hydrogenation of ethylene and the oxidation of methanol. It is shown that prior to PVP removal the particles are moderately active for both reactions. Following removal. the activity for the two reactions diverges. the ethylene hydrogenation rate increases 10-fold. while the methanol oxidation rate decreases 3-fold. To better understand this effect the capping agent prior to. and the residual carbon remaining after UV treatment are probed by sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. Prior to removal no major differences are observed when the particles are exposed to alternating H2 and O2 environments.

Remarkably. the ionic conductivity of solutions and ionogels with low gelator concentrations is higher than that of neat [BMIm][BF4]. On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations. the origin of this phenomenon is attributed to the higher affinity of gelator molecules towards [BF4]− ions. which reduces the electrostatic attraction between [BMIm]+ and [BF4]− and thus increases their mobility. With increasing gelator concentration. the ionic conductivity decreases due to the formation of a denser gelator matrix. which hinders the pathways for ionic transport.

DMSO as oxidant. under microwave irradiation (MW) in a solvent-and metal-free method. The general idea is to combine organoselenium compounds and triazole nuclei to obtain molecules capable of becoming a powerful class due to their potential pharmacological activity.

Thus. the development of direct. clean and environmentally appropriate procedures. which are in accordance with the principles of green chemistry. for the synthesis of these compounds remains highly desirable. Thus. the present work developed the synthesis of β-amino selenides with only 20 minutes of reaction time. following the conditions previously mentioned. In addition. encouraged by these results. the scope of the reaction was expanded using also diorganoil disulfides and ditellurides. obtaining molecules with good to excellent yields.

Both bulk and surface properties have been investigated. In bulk ceria defect clusters incorporating indium or cadmium dopants with oxygen vacancies have been modelled. The binding energies show an isolated Cd2+ defect prefers to be in a first nearest neighbour site with respect to an oxygen vacancy; the In3+ ion shows no such preference. When Cd2+ and In3+ bind to Ce3+ ions (small polarons present in CeO2− x). at least one of the ions must be at a second neighbour site with respect to the vacancy.

Therefore. the use of antiangiogenic agents is one of the most critical strategies for the treatment of cancer. In addition. the complexity of cancer pathogenicity raises the need for multi-targeting agents. Coumarins are multi-targeting natural agents belonging to the class of benzopyrones. Coumarins have several biological and pharmacological effects. including antimicrobial. antioxidant. anti-inflammation. anticoagulant. anxiolytic. analgesic. and anticancer properties. Several reports have shown that the anticancer effect of coumarins and their derivatives are mediated through targeting angiogenesis by modulating the functions of vascular endothelial growth factor as well as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. which are involved in cancer pathogenesis. In the present review. we focus on the antiangiogenic effects of coumarins and related structure-activity relationships with particular emphasis on cancer.

Ltd.,We have successfully synthesized optically active organoboron aminoquinolate‐based coordination polymers bearing the chiral side chain derived from L‐alanine. and studied their optical behavior by UV–vis and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Higher absolute quantum yields (ΦF) of the obtained polymers. measured by integrating sphere method. were observed with electron‐withdrawing substituent (ΦF = 0.80) than with electron‐donating substituent (ΦF = 0.52). The circular dichroism (CD) study in the mixed solvents of CHCl3 and DMF showed that the secondary structures of the obtained polymers were stabilized by hydrogen‐bonding interaction in the side chain. From concentration dependence on the CD spectra. the chirality of the obtained polymers originated from the nature of one molecule. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons.

Dichelobacter nodosus is the causative agent of ovine footrot. a highly contagious disease that is characterized by the separation of the hoof from the underlying tissue. D. nodosus secretes three subtilisin-like proteases whose analysis forms the basis of diagnostic tests that differentiate between virulent and benign strains and have been postulated to play a role in virulence. We have constructed protease mutants of D. nodosus; their analysis in a sheep virulence model revealed that one of these enzymes. AprV2. was required for virulence.

The prototypical P35 family member. AcP35 from Autographa californica M nucleopolyhedrovirus. has been extensively studied. Bacterially purified AcP35 has been previously shown to inhibit caspases from insect. mammalian and nematode species. This inhibition occurs via a pseudosubstrate mechanism involving caspase-mediated cleavage of a “reactive site loop” within the P35 protein. which ultimately leaves cleaved P35 covalently bound to the caspase's active site. We observed that AcP35 purifed from Saccharomyces cerevisae inhibited caspase activity more efficiently than AcP35 purified from Escherichia coli. This differential potency was more dramatic for another P35 family member. MaviP35. which inhibited human caspase 3 almost 300-fold more potently when purified from yeast than bacteria. Biophysical assays revealed that MaviP35 proteins produced in bacteria and yeast had similar primary and secondary structures. However. bacterially produced MaviP35 possessed greater thermal stability and propensity to form higher order oligomers than its counterpart purified from yeast. Caspase 3 could process yeast-purified MaviP35. but failed to detectably cleave bacterially purified MaviP35.

The use of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles as template offers a larger surface area to antibacterial materials and makes them magnetically separable. Coating of polydopamine prevents the aggregation of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles as well as introduces sites for further functionalization. Primary amine groups on the polydopamine surface are exploited to introduce the barbituric acid moiety on the surface by a simple two-step reaction. The barbituric acid moieties on the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles thereafter produce antibacterial N-halamine groups upon treatment with NaOCl. The synthesized antibacterial materials display promising antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. as measured by zone inhibition and broth …,True,dCeyg7UAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,7,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aadc56/meta,7135344992917144795,/scholar?cites=7135344992917144795,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1591/aadc56,0,0,0

Herein. we developed a nanocomposite (M3D–PAA–CCN) based on polyacrylic acid (PAA) crosslinked with magnetic 3D crosslinkers (M3D) and carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (CCN). for the removal of cationic dyes from aqueous solutions. Acrylic-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles were covalently linked to the polymer chains via the form of the 3D crosslinker to introduce magnetic properties into the as-synthesized nanocomposite. The addition of highly dispersive CCN reduced the gel-like properties of the nanocomposite and instead incorporated a diffusive nature. which was more desirable for adsorbents.

The application of visible–infrared sum-frequency generation spectroscopy to such systems requires a careful interpretation of the results. as the electric field magnitude and phase at each interface must be determined in a manner that takes thin-film interference effects into account. Several schemes have been proposed for handling the local field corrections. and these methods all have their origins in linear optics. We first provide an extensive discussion of the cases in which the film is sufficiently thick that multiple beam interference can be ignored or sufficiently thin in which the relevant expressions collapse to simple forms. Then. we illustrate a straightforward method that has a concise analytic solution in the case of a single thin film that exhibits interference effects.

In the case of inorganic salts. unwanted etching processes. caused by acids formed as a result of the precursor decomposition. lead to degradation of the films performance.

In this contribution the effect of each precursor used for deposition by spray-pyrolysis will be explored and their role in determining the optical and electrical properties of Cr2O3 will be outlined. A correlation between the structural. electrical. and optical properties upon introducing nitrogen precursors has been established. In particular it has been shown that the presence of ammonium salts in the deposition environment results in less absorbing films.

We used theory to identify previously unknown ternary compounds in the Zn–Mo–N systems. Zn3MoN4 and ZnMoN2. and to analyze their bonding environment. Experiments show that Zn–Mo–N alloys can form in broad composition range from Zn3MoN4 to ZnMoN2 in the wurtzite-derived structure. accommodating very large off-stoichiometry.

In particular. it will be shown that the solvent composition affects the crystallographic orientation of the deposited films. as well as their roughness and electrical properties. Using water leads to higher resistive films than methanol. The choice of precursor salts also has an effect on the electrical properties. as using organic precursors leads to lower resistivity films. In both cases post-annealing helps to reduce the overall resistivity of the films. The reduction in resistivity will change depending on the initial deposition condition of the films. with lower values observed for films deposited at lower temperature.

India,After chemico-physical characterization of CuI thin films. the structures indium tin oxide (ITO) /CuI are systematically studied. We show that the morphology of the 3 nm thick CuI film depends on its deposition rate. To obtain smooth homogeneous CuI film. it is necessary to depose it at 0.005 nm/s. After optimization of the deposition conditions of CuI. it is shown that it behaves like a template for the organic layer. For instance. when the organic film is copper-phthalocyanine. the molecules which are usually perpendicular to the plane of the substrate lie parallel to it when deposited onto CuI. In a same way. when the electron donor is a prophyrin derivative. CuI allows to double the power conversion efficiency of the cells based on the heterojunction porphyrin/C60. When CuI is used as anode buffer layer. it increases systematically the short circuit current. the open circuit voltage. thus the efficiency of the organic solar cell. These effects are related. not only to the improvement of the band matching between the ITO and the electron donor. but also to the templating effect of the CuI. Moreover. we show that the beneficial effect of CuI is effective. not only with ITO. but also with fluorine doped tin oxide.,True,e-GelEIAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,16,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/handle/123456789/19926,6545557512158085054,/scholar?cites=6545557512158085054,,http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/19926/1/IJPAP%2051%288%29%20569-582.pdf,0,0,0

Roughly below 260 K. the thermal response is governed by the displacement of individual surface atoms. Above such temperature. phase separation proceeds via cooperative rearrangements involving also bulklike atomic species. The result is the formation of systems with an Ag-rich phase segregated at the surface.

Understanding SEI formation and its impact on cycle life is made more complex by the oxidation of silicon materials in air or during synthesis. which leads to SiOx coatings of varying thicknesses that form the true surface of the electrode. In this paper. the lithiation of SiO2-coated Si is studied in a controlled manner using SiO2 coatings of different thicknesses grown on Si wafers via thermal oxidation. SiO2 thickness has a profound effect on lithiation: below 2 nm. SEI formation followed by uniform lithiation occurs at positive voltages versus Li/Li+.

The Z isomers were isolated by chromatographic methods and characterized by 1H NMR. UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The Z compounds are stable even in solution for several months. Such stability is due to a thermodynamic stabilization by the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the Z structure. which is not seen in the E configuration. Furthermore. some of the compounds were used as ligands for various metal centers (Zn2+. Co2+ and Hg2+) and their electronic properties were studied including measurements of cyclic voltammetry.

One representative example is the copper-oxide superconductors. where stripe order is thought to be relevant to the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity. Identifying and studying the stripe phases in conventional strongly correlated systems are. however. challenging due to the complexity and limited tunability of these materials. Here we uncover stripe phases in WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattices with continuously gate-tunable charge densities by combining optical anisotropy and electronic compressibility measurements. We find strong electronic anisotropy over a large doping range peaked at 1/2 filling of the moiré superlattice. The 1/2-state is incompressible and assigned to a (insulating) stripe crystal phase. It can be continuously melted by thermal fluctuations around 35 K. The domain configuration revealed by wide-field imaging shows a preferential alignment along the high-symmetry axes of the moiré superlattice. Away from 1/2 filling. we observe additional stripe crystals at commensurate filling 1/4. 2/5 and 3/5. The anisotropy also extends into the compressible regime of the system at incommensurate fillings. indicating the presence of electronic liquid crystal states. The observed filling-dependent stripe phases agree with the theoretical phase diagram of the extended Hubbard model on a triangular lattice in the flat band limit. Our results demonstrate that two-dimensional semiconductor moiré superlattices are a highly tunable platform to study the stripe phases and …,True,R_1Y1NEAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C,11,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12068,16925581289950623067,/scholar?cites=16925581289950623067,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12068,0,0,0

Oxidation has been carried out ex situ in a high-pressure cell and subsequent vacuum-transfer and characterization by ultra-high vacuum XPS. as well as in situ characterization by synchrotron based near ambient pressure XPS. On Au(111) alloying of Pd with the substrate competes with oxidation and only for sufficiently thick Pd films oxidation is obtained.

The effectiveness of the experiment rests with the fact that the resist optical properties change with exposure and that the optical properties are directly related to the concentration of PAG compound. These conditions are not typically satisfied in CA resists and thus C is unobtainable by this method. FT-IR spectroscopy can directly measure changes in the photoactive species by isolating and measuring absorbance peaks unique to the photoactive species.

In this study. bioinspired by antimicrobial skins of natural living beings. we developed a self-healing bactericidal coating through the immobilization of hydrophobic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) into a multilayer film. which was constructed through the enhanced exponential layer-by-layer assembly of polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The (PEI/PAA) film shows particular dynamic properties from the as-prepared thin solid film to a spongy microporous structure via acid solution treatment. and then back to the thin solid film by eliminating micropores via the treatment of saturated humidity.

The grafted TiO2 nanoparticles are compatible with a commercial epoxy resin enabling the preparation of thick (1 mm) transparent high-refractive index TiO2/epoxy nanocomposites. In order to maximize the volumetric loading and thereby the refractive index of nanocomposites. the minimum graft densities that can lead to high optical transparency were identified. It was found that. when the graft density was too low to form polymer brushes. the dispersion of the grafted particles changed from a dispersed state to an agglomerated state. The transition of the dispersion state was in good agreement with the theoretical prediction from a parametric model.

Vitamin D can impact the function of virtually every cell in the gut by binding to its intracellular receptor (VDR) and subsequently transcribing relevant genes. In the lumen. the mucus layer and the underlying epithelium serve to keep resident microbiota at bay. Vitamin D ensures an appropriate level of antimicrobial peptides in the mucus and maintains epithelial integrity by reinforcing intercellular junctions. Should bacteria penetrate the epithelial layer and enter the interstitium. immune sentinel cells (e.g. macrophages. dendritic cells. and innate lymphoid cells) elicit inflammation and trigger the adaptive immune response by activating Th1/Th17 cells.

According to previous results. 25 (OH) D concentrations are. on average. relatively low in countries with abundant sunshine. including those of the Middle East and North Africa region. as well as lower-latitude Europe. The standard explanation for this phenomenon is that people wear concealing clothing because of cultural and religious practices and that high temperatures in summer limit direct sun exposure. However. the role of diet in the development of profound hypovitaminosis D has not been adequately explored in those countries. To examine how diet affects vitamin D status in the Middle Eastern and European countries. a search was conducted for papers from that region reporting 25 (OH) D concentrations.

Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes is widespread. but little is known about specific behavior use patterns. There have been no studies that have biochemically verified smoking status.   Methods The UAE Healthy Future Study (UAEHFS) seeks to understand the causes of non-communicable diseases through a 20.000-person cohort study. During the study pilot. 517 Emirati nationals were recruited to complete a questionnaire. provide clinical measurements and biological samples. Complete smoking data were available for 428 participants. Validation of smoking status via cotinine testing was conducted based on complete questionnaire data and matching urine samples for 399 participants. using a cut-off of 200ng/ml to indicate active smoking status.   Results Self-reported tobacco use was 36% among men and 3% among women in the sample. However. biochemical verification of smoking status revealed that 42% men and 9% of women were positive for cotinine indicating possible recent tobacco use. Dual and poly-use of tobacco products was fairly common with 32% and 6% of the sample reporting respectively.   Conclusions This is the first study in the region to biochemically verify tobacco use self-report data.

However. these relationships are still unclear and have not been explored within the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. In this study. the relationship between vitamin D. risk for depression symptoms. and sun avoidance inventory was explored. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among a sample of employees working in Abu Dhabi (the capital of UAE) was first assessed and then the influence of demographic factors (age. gender and ethnicity) on vitamin D status was examined. A random sample of 141 employees from two different major oil companies within Abu Dhabi was selected and tested for vitamin D deficiency. All participants worked indoors and reflected the multiethnic nature of Abu Dhabi residents. Serum levels of vitamin D [25 (OH) D] were measured and depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory version 2. Moreover. the sun avoidance inventory (SAI) was used to assess attitudes towards sun avoidance in the context of vitamin D deficiency.

The incidence is estimated to be in the range of 15%–30% in patients with nonradicular low back pain. The signs and symptoms of SIJ pain mimic pain arising from other causes of low back pain. There is no single symptom or physical examination finding that can firmly diagnose SIJ as a source of patient's pain. There is good evidence suggesting that a combination of three or more positive provocative tests strongly suggests SIJ dysfunction.

Early aggressive approach and multidisciplinary intervention prevent limb loss and disease fatality. Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects long term glycaemic control and helps in prediction of complications as well as response to treatment.Methods: A total of 50 patients with diabetic foot ulcer (Wegner grade 1. 2) made nucleus of this study. Every patient underwent proper clinical. hematological and sonological assessment. Optimum treatment was provided and the effect of improvement in HbA1c value was correlated with duration of wound healing. vasculopathy and neuropathy over a 12 week follow uu.Results: Mean age of presentation was 53.4 years and patients developed diabetic ulcers (Wegner grade 1. 2) at a mean HbA1c value of 6.6.

Higher estimates between GCV and PCV values indicated presence of substantial genetic variability and less environmental influence for plant height. secondary branches per plant. fruit weight. stalk length. fruits per plant. seeds per fruit. fresh fruit yield per plant. dry fruit yield per plant. ascorbic acid. capsaicin content. oleoresin content and capsanthin content. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance as per cent mean was noticed for most of the traits except days to 50% flowering and 1000 seed weight suggesting presence of additive gene action for inheritance of these yield attributes. Hence. simple selection would be effective for improvement of these traits.

Such welfare. it has been recognised. needs to be with respect to programmes that are geared for developing human resources. Nowhere is this more evident than in programmes that have been formulated for the two most disadvantaged groups viz. the scheduled tribes and scheduled caste population. While tribal populations are universal. the scheduled caste population is unique to India and is characterised by untouchability.Along with the scheduled castes (SC) population. the tribal population (including denotified and nomadic tribes) represent the most backward and disadvantaged group in the highly stratified caste ridden Indian society. While the social. economic and educational deprivation of these groups is a common and unifying characteristic. each group also has its own particular problem that distinguishes it from the other.

Since the crucial interaction between pro- and anti-apoptotic members occurs via a conserved region located on the surface of the protein. a viable way to inhibit the anti-death activity of Bcl-2 proteins is to design small molecule inhibitors that occupy this cavity. Here. we describe a structure-based approach that led to the identification of four small molecule inhibitors directed at the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the Bcl-2 family protein Bcl-xL.

To drive shock waves into target materials. an apparatus to launch and monitor laser-driven flyer-plates was developed. This was coupled to a home built photonic Doppler velocimeter (PDV) which tracks the motion of flyer plates and embedded gauges. This system was characterized using PDV to determine the range of impact velocities and shock wave durations that aluminum or copper flyers can impart into materials. Ultrafast stroboscopic imaging was used to determine the planarity and size of flyer plates at the time of material impact.

Numerous applications of X-ray CT in medical diagnosis and materials characterization have been reported. many involving field-specific innovations in the imaging technology itself. Yet. quantitative summarization to link image features to properties of interest has been rare. We address this issue by employing state-of-the-art technics in scalar field topology for the summarization of X-ray CT images of an example biphasic system. By varying processing-parameters we create different microstructures. evolve them through accelerated thermal aging. CT-image them pre- and post-aged. and demonstrate the ability of our image summarization method to systematically track process- and age-related changes. which can often be very subtle.

Livermore. CA (United States),Pulsed x-ray imaging can provide substantial insight into a wide range of initiation-related phenomena. particularly the in-situ imaging of dynamically compressed voids. which are thought to play a fundamental role in explosive initiation. Current models of the dynamic compression behavior of inhomogeneous materials are empirically calibrated to bulk. aggregate experimental data. The development of more fundamental models depends on detailed measurements and corresponding simulations which resolve single void collapse events. Further. since material strength depends on scale. experiments at the scale of actual voids (< 10 μm) are preferred. Since the field of view for these experiments is relatively small (~ 100s μm) and void collapse occurs at low pressure. these experiments can be performed with a small scale (100 mJ) laser in a portable experimental setup. Here we present the results of x-ray imaging experiments at the Advanced Photon Source on voids embedded in TNT and silicon using both explosive and laserdriven shocks. which approach the spatial scale of void collapse in actual explosives. 1-10 μm.,True,TvFKpywAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,0,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1572248,,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1572248,0,0,0

1195565,The Influence Of Screw Configuration And Other Mechanistic Approaches On The Morphology And Release Of Drugs From Polymeric Matrices Utilizing Hot-Melt Extrusion Technology,2020,Joseph Morott,,,,,,Twin-screw extrusion. often referred to as Hot-Melt Extrusion within the pharmaceutical industry. is an efficient. continuous and solvent-free process that has been investigated extensively for its solubility enhancement applications. and. to a lesser degree. for its potential to replace more conventional “batch” technologies. The research contained herein focuses on the latter of these with attention paid to the effects of screw configuration. In this research. the twin-screw extrusion process was utilized to produce taste masked formulations of a BCS I API. which necessitated the prevention of amorphous phase formation. The resulting granules were subsequently incorporated into an immediate release orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) platform. This processing technology was also evaluated as an alternative platform for the production of dry granulations. henceforth referred to as Twin-Screw Dry Granulation (TSDG). This novel processing approach was investigated using Quality by Design (QbD) principles; however. as the QbD paradigm in product oriented. the process was assessed by the successful production of a drug intermediate and. ultimately. an optimized target formulation. The TSDG process was utilized to produce a high drug loaded sustained release solid oral dosage form in which the crystalline lattice was preserved. Moreover. as a fundamental purpose of granulating technologies is the improvement of the flowability of one or more of the granule constituents. the resulting granules were assessed for enhanced flowability when compared to the very poorly flowing API. Finally. the effects of screw configuration on API morphology was …,True,CeKsZ9QAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://egrove.olemiss.edu/etd/1899/,,,,,0,0,0

The topological analysis predicts that for uncharged surfaces the adsorption mode is such that the water molecules are adsorbed almost parallel to the surface. For laponite surfaces. where there is a net charge. the adsorption mode involves electrostatic repulsion between the negative lone pairs on the water molecules and the ones on the surface oxygen atoms. As a consequence. the water molecules bind to the surface in a perpendicular and tilted approach. minimizing the repulsive interactions.
