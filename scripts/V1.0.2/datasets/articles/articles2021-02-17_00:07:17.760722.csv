We show that Vpus from SIVgsn. SIVmus. and SIVmon infecting Cercopithecus primate species also degrade CD4 and antagonize tetherin. In contrast. SIVcpz. the immediate precursor of HIV-1. whose Vpu shares a common ancestry with SIVgsn/mus/mon Vpu. uses Nef rather than Vpu to counteract chimpanzee tetherin. Human tetherin. however. is resistant to Nef and thus poses a significant barrier to zoonotic transmission of SIVcpz to humans. Remarkably. Vpus from nonpandemic HIV-1 O strains are poor tetherin antagonists. whereas those from the rare group N viruses do not degrade CD4. Thus. only HIV-1 M evolved a fully functional Vpu following the three independent cross-species transmissions that resulted in HIV-1 groups M. N. and O.

1035957,Virus budding and the ESCRT pathway,2013,Jörg Votteler and Wesley I Sundquist,14,,3,232-241,Cell Press,Enveloped viruses escape infected cells by budding through limiting membranes. In the decade since the discovery that HIV recruits cellular ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery to facilitate viral budding. this pathway has emerged as the major escape route for enveloped viruses. In cells. the ESCRT pathway catalyzes analogous membrane fission events required for the abscission stage of cytokinesis and for a series of “reverse topology” vesiculation events. Studies of enveloped virus budding are therefore providing insights into the complex cellular mechanisms of cell division and membrane protein trafficking (and vice versa). Here. we review how viruses mimic cellular recruiting signals to usurp the ESCRT pathway. discuss mechanistic models for ESCRT pathway functions. and highlight important research frontiers.,True,T-jJRycAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,384,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813002941,6884428449150220199,/scholar?cites=6884428449150220199,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813002941,0,0,0

However. FRET microscopy is technically challenging and does not allow assessing interactions in large cell numbers. To overcome these limitations we developed a flow cytometry-based FRET assay and analysed interactions of human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV and SIV) Nef and Vpu proteins with cellular factors. as well as HIV Rev multimer-formation.  Results Amongst others. we characterize the interaction of Vpu with CD317 (also termed Bst-2 or tetherin). a host restriction factor that inhibits HIV release from infected cells and demonstrate that the direct binding of both is mediated by the Vpu membrane-spanning region. Furthermore. we adapted our assay to allow the identification of novel protein interaction partners in a high-throughput format.  Conclusion The presented combination of FRET and FACS offers the precious possibility to discover and define protein interactions in living cells and is expected to contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treatment of human diseases.,True,T-jJRycAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,150,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009344,13710299852672200808,/scholar?cites=13710299852672200808,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009344,0,0,0

The HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) and the EBOV-glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) both inhibit tetherin. Here. we compared tetherin counteraction by EBOV-GP and Vpu. We found that EBOV-GP but not Vpu counteracted tetherin from different primate species. indicating that EBOV-GP and Vpu target tetherin differentially. Tetherin interacted with the GP2 subunit of EBOV-GP. which might encode the determinants for tetherin counteraction. Vpu reduced cell surface expression of tetherin while EBOV-GP did not. suggesting that both proteins employ different mechanisms to counteract tetherin. Finally.

Here we analyzed whether the ion channel activity of Vpu is required to antagonize CD317-mediated restriction of virion release. We examined TM-mutants of three conserved residues: the S23A mutation. which was previously shown to abrogate ion channel function. did not affect Vpu mediated augmentation of virus release. In contrast. the A14N and A18N mutation did not affect ion channel activity of Vpu. but substantially reduced its ability to support virus release and to down-regulate CD317 from the cell surface.

In order to establish if the DNA content and the observed heterogeneity is maintained during different growth conditions. we have compared E. histolytica cells growing in xenic and axenic cultures. Our results show that the nuclear DNA content of E. histolytica trophozoites growing in axenic cultures is at least 10 fold higher than in xenic cultures. Re-association of axenic cultures with their bacterial flora led to a reduction of DNA content to the original xenic values. Thus switching between xenic and axenic growth conditions was accompanied by significant changes in the nuclear DNA content of this parasite. Changes in DNA content during encystation-excystation were studied in the related reptilian parasite E. invadens. During excystation of E. invadens cysts. it was observed that the nuclear DNA content increased approximately 40 fold following emergence of trophozoites in axenic cultures. Based on the observed large changes in nuclear size and DNA content. and the minor differences in relative abundance of representative protein coding sequences. rDNA and tRNA sequences. it appears that gain or loss of whole genome copies may be occurring during changes in the growth conditions.

In this study. we demonstrate that this genetic heterogeneity is an inherent feature of the cell cycle of this organism. Chromosome segregation occurs on a variety of novel microtubular assemblies including multi-polar spindles. Cytokinesis in E. histolytica is completed by the mechanical severing of a thin cytoplasmic bridge. either independently or with the help of neighboring cells. Importantly. cytokinesis is uncoupled from the nuclear division cycle. both temporally and spatially. leading to the formation of unequal daughter cells. Sorting of euploid and polyploid cells showed that each of these sub-populations acquired heterogeneous DNA content upon further growth.

Cells with multiple nuclei and nuclei with heterogenous genome contents suggest that regulatory mechanisms that ensure alternation of DNA synthesis and mitosis are absent in this organism. Therefore. several endo-reduplicative cycles may occur without mitosis. The data also shows that unlike other endo-reduplicating organisms. E. histolytica does not undergo a precise number of endo-reduplicative cycles. We propose that irregular endo-reduplication and genome partitioning lead to heterogeneity in the genome content of E. histolytica trophozoites in their proliferative phase.

Interfering with cytoplasmic capping results in the redistribution of target transcripts from polysomes to non-translating mRNPs. where they accumulate in an uncapped but nonetheless stable form. It is generally thought that decapping is preceded by shortening of the poly(A) tail to a length that can no longer support translation. Therefore recapped target transcripts would either have to undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation or retain a reasonably long poly(A) tail if they are to return to the translating pool. In cells that are inhibited for cytoplasmic capping there is no change in the overall distribution of poly(A) lengths or in the elution profile of oligo(dT)-bound targets.

Many ecosystems are dependent on CO2 fixation by either free-living or symbiotic chemoautotrophs. CO2 fixation in the chemoautotroph occurs via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. The cycle is characterized by three unique enzymatic activities: ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. phosphoribulokinase. and sedoheptulose bisphosphatase. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is commonly found in the cytoplasm. but a number of bacteria package much of the enzyme into polyhedral organelles. the carboxysomes.

The chromosomal positions of important frost tolerance and winter survival QTLs on Festuca and Lolium chromosomes 4 and 5 are most likely orthologs of QTLs on Triticeae chromosome 5 which correspond to a cluster of CBF-genes and the major vernalization gene. Gene expression and protein accumulation analyses after cold acclimation shed light on general responses to cold stress. These responses involve modulation of transcription levels of genes encoding proteins involved in cell signalling. cellular transport and proteins associated with the cell membrane.

Species of the subfamily Pooideae. which includes wheat. barley and important forage grasses. have evolved extreme frost tolerance. A class of ice binding proteins that inhibit ice re-crystallisation. specific to the Pooideae subfamily lineage. have been identified in perennial ryegrass and wheat. and these proteins are thought to have evolved from a leucine-rich repeat phytosulfokine receptor kinase (LRR-PSR)-like ancestor gene. Even though the ice re-crystallisation inhibition function of these proteins has been studied extensively in vitro. little is known about the evolution of these genes on the molecular level. We identified 15 putative novel ice re-crystallisation inhibition (IRI)-like protein coding genes in perennial ryegrass. barley. and wheat. Using synonymous divergence estimates we reconstructed the evolution of the IRI-like gene family. We also explored the hypothesis that the IRI-domain has evolved through repeated motif expansion and investigated the evolutionary relationship between a LRR-domain containing IRI coding gene in carrot and the Pooideae IRI-like genes. Our analysis showed that the main expansion of the IRI-gene family happened ~36 million years ago (Mya). In addition to IRI-like paralogs. wheat contained several sequences that likely were products of polyploidisation events (homoeologs). Through sequence analysis we identified two short motifs in the rice LRR-PSR gene highly similar to the repeat motifs of the IRI-domain in cold tolerant grasses.

The ice recrystallization inhibition protein (IRIP) genes. fructosyltransferase (FST) genes. and many C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes are Pooideae specific and important in low temperature responses. Here we used comparative analyses to study conservation and evolution of these gene families in B. distachyon to better understand its potential as a model species for agriculturally important temperate grasses. Brachypodium distachyon contains cold responsive IRIP genes which have evolved through Brachypodium specific gene family expansions. A large cold responsive CBF3 subfamily was identified in B. distachyon. while CBF4 homologs are absent from the genome. No B. distachyon FST gene homologs encode typical core Pooideae FST-motifs and low temperature induced fructan accumulation was dramatically different in B. distachyon compared to core Pooideae species. We conclude that B. distachyon can serve as an interesting model for specific molecular mechanisms involved in low temperature responses in core Pooideae species. However. the evolutionary history of key genes involved in low temperature responses has been different in Brachypodium and core Pooideae species.

One major challenge for aquaculture production is a future stable. predictable and high quality feed supply. Marine oils represent 40% of today's feed. but an increased price and reduced availability is expected to cause a demand for alternative oil resources in the near future. In consequence. the use of vegetable oils as feed for farmed carnivorous cold-water fish is increasing. Although beneficial in some respects. this requires improved fatty acid composition in plants such as soybean or rapeseed to meet the nutritional demands of farmed fish.

This disease affects 200 million people worldwide and almost 800 million people are at risk of acquiring the infection. Although vaccine development against this disease has experienced more failures than successes. encouraging results have recently been obtained using membrane-spanning protein antigens from the tegument of Schistosoma mansoni. Our group recently identified Sm29. another antigen that is present at the adult worm tegument surface. In this study. we investigated murine cellular immune responses to recombinant (r) Sm29 and tested this protein as a vaccine candidate.  Methods and Findings We first show that Sm29 is located on the surface of adult worms and lung-stage schistosomula through confocal microscopy.

The parasite takes advantage of host signals to complete its development in the human body. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a human cytokine involved in skin inflammatory responses. and although its effect on the adult parasite's metabolism and egg-laying process has been previously described. a comprehensive assessment of the TNF-α pathway and its downstream molecular effects is lacking.  Methodology/Principal Findings In the present work we describe a possible TNF-α receptor (TNFR) homolog gene in S. mansoni (SmTNFR). SmTNFR encodes a complete receptor sequence composed of 599 amino acids. and contains four cysteine-rich domains as described for TNFR members. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that SmTNFR highest expression level is in cercariae. 3.5 (±0.7) times higher than in adult worms. Downstream members of the known human TNF-α pathway were identified by an in silico analysis. revealing a possible TNF-α signaling pathway in the parasite. In order to simulate parasite's exposure to human cytokine during penetration of the skin. schistosomula were exposed to human TNF-α just 3 h after cercariae-to-schistosomula in vitro transformation. and large-scale gene expression measurements were performed with microarrays. A total of 548 genes with significantly altered expression were detected. when compared to control parasites. In addition. treatment of adult worms with TNF-α caused a significantly altered expression of 1857 genes. Interestingly. the set of genes altered in adults is different from that of …,True,BAIFUiAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,37,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000556,2010095408281631157,/scholar?cites=2010095408281631157,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000556,0,0,0

K. A.. Rochet. J. C.. Bieganski. R. M.. and Lansbury. P. T.. Jr. (2001) Science 294. 1346–1349). Dopamine inhibition of α-syn fibrillization generated exclusively spherical oligomers that depended on dopamine autoxidation but not α-syn oxidation. because mutagenesis of Met. His. and Tyr residues in α-syn did not abrogate this inhibition. However. truncation of α-syn at residue 125 restored the ability of α-syn to fibrillize in the presence of dopamine. Mutagenesis and competition studies with specific synthetic peptides identified α-syn residues 125–129 (i.e. YEMPS) as an important region in the dopamine-induced inhibition of α-syn fibrillization.

In this paper. a yeast amyloid-forming protein Sup35 was used as a model for understanding amyloid fiber formation. The dynamics of amyloid formation by Sup35 were studied with scanning force microscopy. We found that: 1) the assembly of Sup35 fibers begins with individual NM peptides that aggregate to form large beads or nucleation units which. in turn. form dimers. trimers. tetramers and longer linear assemblies appearing as a string of beads; 2) the morphology of the linear assemblies differ; and 3) fiber assembly suggests an analogy to the aggregation of colloidal particles.

Psychotic illness is strongly associated with the maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) genetic subtype of Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS). but not the deletion subtype (delPWS). This study investigates the clinical features of psychiatric illness associated with PWS. We consider possible genetic and other mechanisms that may be responsible for the development of psychotic illness. predominantly in those with mUPD.Method. The study sample comprised 119 individuals with genetically confirmed PWS. of whom 46 had a history of psychiatric illness. A detailed clinical and family psychiatric history was obtained from these 46 using the PAS-ADD. OPCRIT. Family History and Life Events Questionnaires.Results. Individuals with mUPD had a higher rate of psychiatric illness than those with delPWS (22/34 v. 24/85. p< 0.001). The profile of psychiatric illness in both genetic subtypes resembled an atypical affective disorder with or without psychotic symptoms. Those with delPWS were more likely to have developed a non-psychotic depressive illness (p= 0.005) and those with mUPD a bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms (p= 0.00005). Individuals with delPWS and psychotic illness had an increased family history of affective disorder. This was confined exclusively to their mothers.Conclusions. Psychiatric illness in PWS is predominately affective with atypical features. The prevalence and possibly the severity of illness are greater in those with mUPD.

The affective psychosis associated with PWS has been found to be mainly confined to the propositi with UPD(15)mat rather than to those with a deletion. This suggests that the psychosis may be related to the presence of two copies rather than a single copy of a gene or genes located in the distal half of the region which is paternally imprinted. but maternally active. and whose loss results in Angelman syndrome (AS). A large population‐based study of PWS allowed the identification of 12 people with a 15q11–q13 deletion who had suffered psychotic episodes and four adults with UPD(15)mat who so far had not.

In this Opinion article. we suggest that the reason for this impasse is the over-reliance on current physical models of protein folding that are based on the assumption that proteins are able to fold spontaneously without assistance. These models arose from studies conducted in vitro on a biased sample of smaller. easier-to-isolate proteins. whose native structures appear to be thermodynamically stable. Meanwhile. the vast empirical data on the majority of larger proteins suggests that once these proteins are completely denatured in vitro. they cannot fold into native conformations without assistance. Moreover. they tend to lose their native conformations spontaneously and irreversibly in vitro. and therefore such conformations must be metastable. We propose a model of protein folding that is based on the notion that the folding of all proteins in the cell is mediated by the actions of the “protein folding machine” that includes the ribosome. various chaperones. and other components involved in co-translational or post-translational formation. maintenance and repair of protein native conformations in vivo.

Their tightly controlled fluctuations (“zinc signals”) in the picomolar range of concentrations modulate cellular signaling pathways.

Amplitudes of zinc signals are determined by the cellular zinc buffering capacity. which itself is redox-sensitive. In part by interfering with zinc and redox buffering. reactive species. drugs. toxins. and metal ions can elicit zinc signals that initiate physiological and pathobiochemical changes or lead to cellular injury when free zinc ions are sustained at higher concentrations.

Stoichiometric amounts of acrolein release zinc from zinc–thiolate coordination sites in proteins such as metallothionein and alcohol dehydrogenase.

Single Trp-mutants of these proteins all show a double- or triple-exponential fluorescence decay. For ten of these lifetimes the corresponding rotameric state could be identified by comparing the bimolecular acrylamide quenching constant (kq) and the relative solvent exposure of the side chain in that microstate. In the absence of any identifiable quencher. the origin of the lifetime heterogeneity is interpreted in terms of the electron transfer process from the indole Cɛ3 atom to the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond. Therefore it is expected that a shorter [Cɛ3-C=O] distance leads to a shorter lifetime as observed for these ten rotamers.

O2. and CO is an important area of research; however. little is know about how CO is sensed biologically. The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum responds to CO by activating transcription of two operons that encode a CO-oxidizing system. A protein. CooA. has been identified as necessary for this response. CooA is a member of a family of transcriptional regulators similar to the cAMP receptor protein and fumavate nitrate reduction from Escherichia coli.

These include carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH) and a CO-tolerant hydrogenase. Together these enzymes catalyze the following conversion: CO + H2O --> CO2 + H2. This system enables R. rubrum to grow in the dark on CO as the sole energy source. Expression of this system has been shown previously to be regulated at the transcriptional level by CO. We have now identified the remainder of the CO-regulated genes encoded in a contiguous region of the R. rubrum genome.

Nevertheless. T cells are inherently cross-reactive and often react with ‘foreign’ allogeneic MHC molecules (direct T-cell alloreactivity). manifested clinically as organ transplant rejection.

Thus. in tissue transplantation. a substantial proportion of the recipient's T cells will have the ability to recognize the graft and instigate an immune response against the transplanted tissue. ultimately resulting in graft rejection—a manifestation of T cell alloreactivity. Transplantation of human organs and lymphoid cells as treatment for otherwise life-threatening diseases has become a more routine medical procedure making this problem of great importance.

Our data are consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 to 0.4 μm and provide no evidence that the actin-latrunculin A complex participates in the elongation of actin filaments.

This conclusion is based primarily on in vitro kinetic experiments using relatively low concentrations of profilin (1–5 μm). However. the cell contains actin regulatory proteins with multiple profilin binding sites that potentially can attract millimolar concentrations of profilin to areas requiring rapid actin filament turnover. We have studied the effects of higher concentrations of profilin (10–100 μm) on actin monomer kinetics at the barbed end. Prior work indicated that profilin might augment actin filament depolymerization in this range of profilin concentration. At barbed-end saturating concentrations (final concentration. ∼40 μm). profilin accelerated the off-rate of actin monomers by a factor of four to six.

These proteins define a new family of actin-binding proteins. They bind G-actin in a 1:1 complex with thermodynamic and kinetic parameters similar to β-thymosins. Like β-thymosins. they slow down nucleotide exchange on G-actin and make a ternary complex with G-actin and Latrunculin A.

We now present evidence for the existence of two actin-binding sites that not only mutually compete but also specifically compete with the actin-binding proteins thymosin β4 and actobindin to bind to actin. The effects of substitution of alanine for phenylalanine within a repeated hexapeptide segment suggest that the noncharged region of the domain contributes to binding affinity. but the binding affinity of peptides corresponding to each binding site has a steep dependence on salt concentration. consistent with presumed electrostatic …,True,Z-MCs1AAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,82,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820785133,16353785998967211201,/scholar?cites=16353785998967211201,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820785133,0,0,0

The present work reports the influence of a treatment with isoflavones for six months on the faecal bacterial communities of 16 menopausal women. as determined by culturing and culture-independent microbial techniques. Changes in faecal communities were analysed with respect to the womenʼs equol-producing phenotype. Compared to baseline. at 1 and 3 months the counts for all microbial populations in the faeces of equol-producing women had increased strongly. In contrast. among the non-producers. the counts for all microbial populations at 1 month were similar to those at baseline. and decreased significantly by 3 and 6 months. Following isoflavone intake. major bands in the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles appeared and disappeared. suggesting important changes in majority populations.

These mutations are spread all over the protein. It is well documented that fALS produces protein aggregates in the motor neurons of fALS patients. which have been found to be associated to mitochondria. We selected eleven SOD1 mutants. most of them reported as pathological. and characterized them investigating their propensity to aggregation using different techniques. from circular dichroism spectra to ThT-binding fluorescence. size-exclusion chromatography and light scattering spectroscopy. We show here that these eleven SOD1 mutants. only when they are in the metal-free form. undergo the same general mechanism of oligomerization as found for the WT metal-free protein. The rates of oligomerization are different but eventually they give rise to the same type of soluble oligomeric species. These oligomers are formed through oxidation of the two free cysteines of SOD1 (6 and 111) and stabilized by hydrogen bonds. between beta strands. thus forming amyloid-like structures. SOD1 enters the mitochondria as demetallated and mitochondria are loci where oxidative stress may easily occur. The soluble oligomeric species. formed by the apo form of both WT SOD1 and its mutants through an oxidative process. might represent the precursor toxic species. whose existence would also suggest a common mechanism for ALS and fALS.

MO interfered with the formation of 1.10-phenanthroline–Fe2+ complex. suggesting that it has chelating activity and captures Fe2+ before 1.10-phenanthroline. The addition of 5 mM ascorbic acid to the reaction mixture dramatically reduced Fe3+ (formed during the incubation time) to Fe2+ indicating that it was an “apparent” chelation.

During infection. T cells that encounter cognate antigens are activated and—in a context-specific manner—proliferate and/or differentiate to become effector T cells. This process is accompanied by important changes in cellular metabolism (known as metabolic reprogramming). The magnitude and spectrum of metabolic reprogramming as it occurs in T cells in the context of acute infection ensure host survival. By contrast. altered T cell metabolism. and hence function. is also observed in various disease states. in which T cells actively contribute to pathology.

As an active ingredient of turmeric. it is well-known for its traditional medicinal properties. The therapeutic values include antioxidant. anti-inflammatory. antiseptic. and anticancer activity with the last being primarily due to inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB besides affecting several biological pathways to arrest tumor growth and its progression. Curcumin with all these positive qualities has only remained a potential candidate for cancer treatment over the years without seeing any proper usage because of its hydrolytic instability involving the diketo moiety in a cellular medium and its poor bioavailability.The situation has changed considerably in recent years with the observation that curcumin in monoanionic form could be stabilized on binding to a metal ion.

Here we considered the possible implication of the EGFR ligand epiregulin (EREG) in glioma development in relation to the activity of the unfolded protein response (UPR) sensor IRE1α. We also examined EREG status in several glioblastoma cell lines and in malignant glioma. Expression and biological properties of EREG were analyzed in human glioma cells in vitro and in human tumor xenografts with regard to the presence of ErbB proteins and to the blockade of IRE1α. Inactivation of IRE1α was achieved by using either the dominant-negative strategy or siRNA-mediated knockdown. EREG was secreted in high amounts by U87 cells. which also expressed its cognate EGF receptor (ErbB1). A stimulatory autocrine loop mediated by EREG was evidenced by the decrease in cell proliferation using specific blocking antibodies directed against either ErbB1 (cetuximab) or EREG itself. In comparison. anti-ErbB2 antibodies (trastuzumab) had no significant effect. Inhibition of IRE1α dramatically reduced EREG expression both in cell culture and in human xenograft tumor models. The high-expression rate of EREG in U87 cells was therefore linked to IRE1α. although being modestly affected by chemical inducers of the endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition. IRE1-mediated production of EREG did not depend on IRE1 RNase domain. as neither the selective dominant-negative invalidation of the RNase activity (IRE1 kinase active) nor the siRNA-mediated knockdown of XBP1 had significant effect on EREG expression.

Here we have studied expression and hypoxic regulation of the testis isoenzyme of PFKFB4 in several malignant cell lines from a female organ--the mammary gland. Our studies clearly demonstrated that PFKFB4 mRNA is also expressed in mammary gland malignant cells (MCF-7 and T47D cell lines) in normoxic conditions and that hypoxia strongly induces it expression. To better understand the mechanism of hypoxic regulation of PFKFB4 gene expression. we used dimethyloxalylglycine. a specific inhibitor of HIF-1alpha hydroxylase enzymes. which strongly increases HIF-1alpha levels and mimics the effect of hypoxia. It was observed that PFKFB4 expression in the MCF7 and T47D cell lines was highly responsive to dimethyloxalylglycine. suggesting that the hypoxia responsiveness of PFKFB4 gene in these cell lines is regulated by HIF-1 proteins. Moreover. desferrioxamine and cobalt chloride. which mimic the effect of hypoxia by chelating or substituting for iron. had a similar stimulatory effect on the expression of PFKFB mRNA. In other mammary gland malignant cell lines (BT549. MDA-MB-468. and SKBR-3) hypoxia and hypoxia mimics also induced PFKFB4 mRNA. but to variable degrees. The hypoxic induction of PFKFB4 mRNA was equivalent to the expression of PFKFB3. Glut1. and VEGF. which are known HIF-1-dependent genes.

1036242,Oligosaccharide synthesis by glycosynthases,2004,Giuseppe Perugino and Antonio Trincone and Mosé Rossi and Marco Moracci,22,,1,31-37,Elsevier Current Trends,Oligosaccharide synthesis is becoming increasingly important to the pharmaceutical industry because these biomolecules have potential application as therapeutics. Enzymatic synthesis of oligosaccharides includes both glycosyl transferases and glycosidases. The main advantage of this approach compared with traditional chemical synthesis is the regio- and stereo-selectivity that can be achieved without the need for protecting functional groups. However. the limited availability of glycosyl transferases. the high cost of their substrates. and the poor yields of the synthetic reactions performed by the glycosidases hamper their use in the large-scale production of oligosaccharides. The recent advent of glycosynthases – specifically mutated glycosidases that efficiently synthesize oligosaccharides but do not hydrolyse them – represents a promising solution to these problems.

Interestingly. ROS also dynamically influences the tumor microenvironment and is known to initiate cancer angiogenesis. metastasis. and survival at different concentrations. At moderate concentration. ROS activates the cancer cell survival signaling cascade involving mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (MAPK/ERK1/2). p38. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt). which in turn activate the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). At high concentrations. ROS can cause cancer cell apoptosis. Hence. it critically depends upon the ROS levels. to either augment tumorigenesis or lead to apoptosis. The major issue is targeting the dual actions of ROS effectively with respect to the concentration bias. which needs to be monitored carefully to impede tumor angiogenesis and metastasis for ROS to serve as potential therapeutic targets exogenously/endogenously.

1036334,The β subunit gate loop is required for RNA polymerase modification by RfaH and NusG,2011,Anastasia Sevostyanova and Georgiy A Belogurov and Rachel A Mooney and Robert Landick and Irina Artsimovitch,43,Molecular cell,2,253-262,Cell Press,In all organisms. RNA polymerase (RNAP) relies on accessory factors to complete synthesis of long RNAs. These factors increase RNAP processivity by reducing pausing and termination. but their molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We identify the β gate loop as an RNAP element required for antipausing activity of a bacterial virulence factor RfaH. a member of the universally conserved NusG family. Interactions with the gate loop are necessary for suppression of pausing and termination by RfaH. but are dispensable for RfaH binding to RNAP mediated by the β′ clamp helices. We hypothesize that upon binding to the clamp helices and the gate loop RfaH bridges the gap across the DNA channel. stabilizing RNAP contacts with nucleic acid and disfavoring isomerization into a paused state. We show that contacts with the gate loop are also required for antipausing by NusG and propose that …,True,mHtYoQQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,83,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276511004230,9202578286504923182,/scholar?cites=9202578286504923182,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276511004230,0,0,0

Here. we report direct monitoring of bacterial RNAP translocation following the addition of a single nucleotide. Time-resolved measurements demonstrated that translocation is delayed relative to nucleotide incorporation and occurs shortly after or concurrently with pyrophosphate release. An investigation of translocation equilibrium suggested that the strength of interactions between RNA 3′ nucleotide and nucleophilic and substrate sites determines the translocation state of transcription elongation complexes. whereas active site opening and closure modulate the affinity of the substrate site. thereby favoring the post- and pre-translocated states. respectively.

Here. we demonstrate that two newly isolated bacterial membrane PPases from the mesophile Methanosarcina mazei (Mm-PPase) and the moderate thermophile Moorella thermoacetica and a previously described PPase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima catalyze Na+ rather than H+ transport into Escherichia coli inner membrane vesicles (IMV). When assayed in uncoupled IMV. the three PPases exhibit an absolute requirement for Na+ but display the highest hydrolyzing activity in the presence of both Na+ and K+.

RfaH is a cellular elongation factor that acts as a polarity suppressor by increasing RNA polymerase (RNAP) processivity. In this work. we provide evidence that RfaH acts by reducing transcriptional pausing at certain positions rather than by accelerating RNAP at all sites. We show that ‘fast’ RNAP variants are characterized by pause-free RNA chain elongation and are resistant to RfaH action. Similarly. the wild-type RNAP is insensitive to RfaH in the absence of pauses. In contrast. those enzymes that may be prone to falling into a paused state are hypersensitive to RfaH. RfaH inhibits pyrophosphorolysis of the nascent RNA and reduces the apparent Michaelis–Menten constant for nucleotides. suggesting that it stabilizes the post-translocated. active …,True,mHtYoQQAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,71,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/35/17/5694/2402333,11754107828619506962,/scholar?cites=11754107828619506962,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/35/17/5694/2402333,0,0,0

RfaH is recruited to the transcription complex during RNA chain elongation through specific interactions with a DNA element called ops. Following recruitment. RfaH remains bound to RNA polymerase (RNAP) and acts as an antiterminator by reducing RNAP pausing and termination at some factor‐independent and Rho‐dependent signals. RfaH consists of two domains connected by a flexible linker. The N‐terminal RfaH domain (RfaHN) recognizes the ops element. binds to the RNAP and reduces pausing and termination in vitro.

The study of novel TRPV1 agonists and antagonists is essential. Here. we report on the characterization of polypeptide antagonists of TRPV1 based on in vitro and in vivo experiments. We evaluated the ability of APHC1 and APHC3 to inhibit TRPV1 using the whole-cell patch clamp approach and single cell Ca 2+ imaging. In vivo tests were performed to assess the biological effects of APHC1 and APHC3 on temperature sensation. inflammation and core body temperature. In the electrophysiological study. both polypeptides partially blocked the capsaicin-induced response of TRPV1. but only APHC3 inhibited acid-induced (pH 5.5) activation of the receptor. APHC1 and APHC3 showed significant antinociceptive and analgesic activity in vivo at reasonable doses (0.01–0.1 mg/kg) and did not cause hyperthermia. Intravenous administration of these polypeptides prolonged hot-plate latency. blocked capsaicin-and formalin-induced behavior. reversed CFA-induced hyperalgesia and produced hypothermia. Notably. APHC3’s ability to inhibit the low pH-induced activation of TRPV1 resulted in a reduced behavioural response in the acetic acid-induced writhing test. whereas APHC1 was much less effective. The polypeptides APHC1 and APHC3 could be referred to as a new class of TRPV1 modulators that produce a significant analgesic effect without hyperthermia.

RPA32. RPA14. respectively). It is a protein essential for most cellular DNA metabolic pathways. Checkpoint proteins Rad9. Rad1. and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA damage-induced checkpoint response. In this report. we presented the evidence that Rad9–Rad1–Hus1 (9–1–1) complex directly interacted with RPA in human cells. and this interaction was mediated by the binding of Rad9 protein to both RPA70 and RPA32 subunits. In addition. the cellular interaction of 9–1–1 with RPA or hyperphosphorylated RPA was stimulated by UV irradiation or camptothecin treatment in a dose-dependent manner.

In this paper. influence of nanoclay on mechanical drilling of PA6 composites. in terms of dust generation. has been reported. With the help of real-time characterization. submicrometer-sized particles (5.6–512 nm). size distribution. and number concentration emitted from polyamide 6/nanoclay composites during mechanical drilling are studied. Total particle concentration for the PA6/nanoclay composites was 20.000 cm−3. while unreinforced panel measured a total concentration of approximately 400.000 cm−3. While the airborne particle concentration for the PA6/nanoclay composites was 20 times lower than for the PA6 matrix. the concentration of deposited nanoparticles doubled for the nanocomposite. The results clearly show that more particles in the size range between 175 and 350 nm are generated. during drilling of the nanocomposites. and these particles deposit in a shorter time. It is likely that the presence of nanoclay in some way retains the formation of high quantity of airborne particles and promotes particle deposition.,True,x-bOR-0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,40,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2012/189386/abs/,729738219423032958,/scholar?cites=729738219423032958,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jnm/2012/189386/abs/,0,0,0

Dynein Targeting. and Membrane Trafficking: Is Dynein the Unifying Theme?,2006,Richard B Vallee and Dileep Varma and Denis L Dujardin,5,,21,2447-2451,Taylor & Francis,ZW10 was initially identified as a mitotic checkpoint protein involved in chromosome segregation. It was subsequently implicated in targeting cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin to mitotic kinetochores. though the relationship between these functions remains incompletely understood. Recent studies have revealed that ZW10 performs important functions in non-dividing cells as well.  These include cytoplasmic dynein targeting to Golgi and other membranes. but also SNARE-mediated ER-Golgi trafficking.

Our analysis of synchronized cells and asynchronously proliferating live single cells revealed a consistent order of replication-coupled destruction during both S-phase entry and DNA repair; Cdt1 is destroyed first. whereas p21 destruction is always substantially later than that of Cdt1. These differences are attributable to the CRL4Cdt2 targeting motif known as the PIP degron. which binds DNA-loaded proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNADNA) and recruits CRL4Cdt2.

In recent years. high flow oxygen system devices have offered an appropriate alternative to standard oxygen therapy devices such as conventional face masks and nasal prongs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical effects of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) compared with standard oxygen face masks in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients after extubation. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 67 consecutive ventilated critical care patients in the ICU over a period of 1 year. The patients were allocated to two treatment groups: HFNC (34 patients. group 1) and non-rebreathing oxygen face mask (NRB)(33 patients. group 2). Vital respiratory and hemodynamic parameters were assessed prior to extubation and 6 hours after extubation. The primary clinical outcomes measured were improvement in oxygenation. ventilation-free days. re-intubation. ICU length of stay. and mortality. RESULTS: The two groups demonstrated similar hemodynamic patterns before and after extubation. The respiratory rate was slightly elevated in both groups after extubation with no differences observed between groups. There were no statistically significant clinical differences in PaCO2. However. the use of HFNC resulted in improved PaO2/FiO2 post-extubation (P< 0.05). There were more ventilator-free days in the HFNC group (P< 0.05) and fewer patients required reintubation (1 vs. 6).

However. inadequate attention has been paid to the issue of stability of enzymes in such media. The results with polyphenol oxidase. peroxidase. acid phosphatase. and trypsin show that solvents with polarity indexes of 5.8 and above are “good” solvents. These solvents when used as cosolvents in aqueous–organic solvent media do not denature the enzymes irreversibly.

Not only Aβ fibrils but also small soluble Aβ oligomers in particular are suspected to be the major toxic species responsible for disease development and progression. The present study reports on in vitro and in vivo properties of the Aβ targeting d-enantiomeric amino acid peptide D3. We show that next to plaque load and inflammation reduction. oral application of the peptide improved the cognitive performance of AD transgenic mice. In addition. we provide in vitro data elucidating the potential mechanism underlying the observed in vivo activity of D3. These data suggest that D3 precipitates toxic Aβ species and converts them into nonamyloidogenic. nonfibrillar. and nontoxic aggregates without increasing the concentration of monomeric Aβ. Thus.

Their light sensitivity is intricately linked to the photochemistry of the non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) chromophore that forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue in the LOV domain upon illumination with blue light. All LOV domains undergo the same primary photochemistry leading to adduct formation; however. considerable variation is found in the lifetime of the adduct state that varies from seconds to several hours. The molecular mechanism underlying this variation among the structurally conserved LOV protein family is not well understood. Here. we describe the structural characterization of PpSB1-LOV. a very slow cycling full-length LOV protein from the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Its crystal structure reveals a novel dimer interface that is mediated by N-and C-terminal auxiliary structural elements and a unique cluster of four arginine residues coordinating with the FMN-phosphate moiety. Site-directed mutagenesis of two arginines (R61 and R66) in PpSB1-LOV resulted in acceleration of the dark recovery reaction approximately by a factor of 280. The presented structural and biochemical data suggest a direct link between structural features and the slow dark recovery observed for PpSB1-LOV.

However. this mode of nucleobase-mediated catalysis has been difficult to establish unambiguously. Here. we used a hyperactivated RNA substrate bearing a 5′-phosphorothiolate to investigate the role of a critical cytosine residue in the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. The hyperactivated substrate specifically suppressed the deleterious effects of cytosine mutations and pH changes. thereby linking the protonation of the nucleobase to leaving-group stabilization. We conclude that the active-site cytosine provides general acid catalysis. mediating proton transfer to the leaving group through a protonated N3-imino nitrogen.

Mechanisms of resistance are complex and often multifactorial. Mechanisms include: 1. Activation of ABC transporters. such as P-gp. which pump out lipophilic compounds that have entered a cell. 2. Activation of cytochrome p450 oxidases which can oxidise lipophilic agents to make them more hydrophilic and accessible for conjugation reaction with glucuronic acid. sulphate or amino acids. and 3.

1036483,Natural products modulate the multifactorial multidrug resistance of cancer,2015,Safaa Yehia Eid and Mahmoud Zaki El-Readi and Sameer Hassan Fatani and Essam Eldin Mohamed Nour Eldin and Michael Wink,6,Pharmacology & Pharmacy,03,146,Scientific Research Publishing,Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a critical problem in cancer chemotherapy. Cancer cells can develop resistance not only to a single cytotoxic drug. but also to entire classes of structurally and functionally unrelated compounds. Several mechanisms can mediate the development of MDR. including increased drug efflux from the cells by ABC-transporters (ABCT). activation of metabolic enzymes. and defective pathways towards apoptosis. Many plant secondary metabolites (SMs) can potentially increase sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutical agents. The present thesis investigates the modulation of MDR by certain medicinal plants and their active compounds. The inhibition of ABCTs (P-gp/MDR1. MRP1. BCRP) and metabolic enzymes (GST and CYP3A4). and the induction of apoptosis are useful indicators of the efficacy of a potential medicinal drug. The focus of this study was the possible mechanisms of drug resistance including: expression of resistance proteins. activation of metabolic enzymes. and alteration of the apoptosis and how to overcome their resistance effect on cancer cells. The overall goal of this review was to evaluate how commonly used medicinal plants and their main active secondary metabolites modulate multidrug resistance in cancer cells in order to validate their uses as anticancer drugs. introduce new therapeutic options for resistant cancer. and facilitate the development of their anticancer strategies and/or combination therapies. In conclusion. SMs from medicinal plants exhibit multitarget activity against MDR-related proteins. metabolic enzymes. and apoptotic signaling. this may help to overcome …,True,0hXV5o8AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,41,https://www.scirp.org/html/5-2500603_54783.htm,5749729289134562975,/scholar?cites=5749729289134562975,,https://www.scirp.org/html/5-2500603_54783.htm,0,0,0

1036490,Risk assessment of fluoride intake from tea in the Republic of Ireland and its implications for public health and water fluoridation,2016,Declan T Waugh and William Potter and Hardy Limeback and Michael Godfrey,13,International journal of environmental research and public health,3,259,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The Republic of Ireland (RoI) is the only European Country with a mandatory national legislation requiring artificial fluoridation of drinking water and has the highest per capita consumption of black tea in the world. Tea is a hyperaccumulator of fluoride and chronic fluoride intake is associated with multiple negative health outcomes. In this study. fifty four brands of the commercially available black tea bag products were purchased and the fluoride level in tea infusions tested by an ion-selective electrode method. The fluoride content in all brands tested ranged from 1.6 to 6.1 mg/L. with a mean value of 3.3 mg/L. According to our risk assessment it is evident that the general population in the RoI is at a high risk of chronic fluoride exposure and associated adverse health effects based on established reference values. We conclude that the culture of habitual tea drinking in the RoI indicates that the total cumulative dietary fluoride intake in the general population could readily exceed the levels known to cause chronic fluoride intoxication. Evidence suggests that excessive fluoride intake may be contributing to a wide range of adverse health effects. Therefore from a public health perspective. it would seem prudent and sensible that risk reduction measures be implemented to reduce the total body burden of fluoride in the population.

1036491,Ergogenic effects of β-alanine and carnosine: proposed future research to quantify their efficacy,2012,John Caruso and Jessica Charles and Kayla Unruh and Rachel Giebel and Lexis Learmonth and William Potter,4,,7,585-601,Molecular Diversity Preservation International,β-alanine is an amino acid that. when combined with histidine. forms the dipeptide carnosine within skeletal muscle. Carnosine and β-alanine each have multiple purposes within the human body; this review focuses on their roles as ergogenic aids to exercise performance and suggests how to best quantify the former’s merits as a buffer. Carnosine normally makes a small contribution to a cell’s total buffer capacity; yet β-alanine supplementation raises intracellular carnosine concentrations that in turn improve a muscle’s ability to buffer protons. Numerous studies assessed the impact of oral β-alanine intake on muscle carnosine levels and exercise performance. β-alanine may best act as an ergogenic aid when metabolic acidosis is the primary factor for compromised exercise performance. Blood lactate kinetics. whereby the concentration of the metabolite is measured as it enters and leaves the vasculature over time. affords the best opportunity to assess the merits of β-alanine supplementation’s ergogenic effect. Optimal β-alanine dosages have not been determined for persons of different ages. genders and nutritional/health conditions. Doses as high as 6.4 g day− 1. for ten weeks have been administered to healthy subjects. Paraesthesia is to date the only side effect from oral β-alanine ingestion. The severity and duration of paraesthesia episodes are dose-dependent. It may be unwise for persons with a history of paraesthesia to ingest β-alanine. As for any supplement. caution should be exercised with β-alanine supplementation.

Yet. their evolution and their phylogenetic relationships have been relatively little studied. This paper describes the phylogenetic relationships between a number of Psittaciformes as derived from the sequences of the third intron of the Z-chromosomal and W-chromosomal spindlin genes. The Z-chromosomal sequences of the kakapo (Strigops habroptilus). the kea (Nestor notabilis). and the kaka (Nestor meridionalis) from New Zealand form a cluster which is the sister group to all other Psittaciformes. The results show further that the Z-chromosomal sequences of the other species can be divided into two groups based on the occurrence of a sequence element ACCCT.

PCC6803 to control phototaxis toward blue light. In this study. we probe the involvement of a conserved Tyr8–Gln50–Met93 triad in promoting an output signal upon blue light excitation of the bound flavin. Analysis of acrylamide quenching of Trp91 fluorescence shows that the side chain of this residue remains partially solvent exposed in both the lit and dark states. Mutational analysis demonstrates that substitution mutations at Tyr8 and Gln50 result in the loss of the photocycle while a mutation of Met93 does not appreciably disturb the formation of the light-excited state and only minimally accelerates its decay from 5.7 to 4.5 s. However. mutations of Tyr8.

In Drosophila. laboratory experiments have revealed that energy storage patterns differ between populations selected for desiccation and starvation. This suggests that flies may use different sources of energy when exposed to these stresses. but the actual substrates used have not been examined. We measured lipid. carbohydrate. and protein content in 16 Drosophila species from arid and mesic habitats. In five species. we measured the rate at which each substrate was metabolized under starvation or desiccation stress. Rates of lipid and protein metabolism were similar during starvation and desiccation. but carbohydrate metabolism was several-fold higher during desiccation.

Recently. we have established a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for canine leptin. In the present study. plasma leptin concentrations were measured in experimentally developed obese beagles and in clinically obese dogs. When 5 male beagles were given a high-energy diet for 3 months. all of them became obese and the plasma leptin concentration significantly increased from 2.4±1.2 to 4.9±0.9 ng/ml. positively correlating with body fat content estimated by the deuterium oxide dilution method (r= 0.87). The leptin concentrations of plasma samples collected from 59 dogs in veterinary practices were compared with their body condition scores (BCS). The plasma leptin concentrations of obese dogs were 9.7±0.7 and 12.3±1.5 ng/ml at BCS= 4 and BCS= 5. respectively. which were significantly higher than those of optimal (BCS= 3) dogs (2.7±0.3 ng/ml). There was no significant effect of sex and breed. A weak positive correlation (r= 0.37) was found between the plasma leptin concentration and age. probably due to the lesser content of visceral fat in puppies younger than 1 year old.

In this study. we investigated the effect of N. sativa oil on the drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and whether it has a protective effect against the acute hepatotoxicity of CCl4. Intraperitoneal injection of rats with CCl4 drastically decreased CYP2E1. CYP2B. CYP3A2. CYP2C11. and CYP1A2 mRNA and protein expressions. Oral administration of 1 ml/kg N. sativa oil every day for one week prior to CCl4 injection alleviated CCl4-induced suppression of CYP2B. CYP3A2. CYP2C11. and CYP1A2. Moreover. CCl4 increased iNOS and TNFα mRNA. while N. sativa oil administration for one week prior to CCl4 injection down regulated the CCl4-induced iNOS mRNA and upregulated IL-10 mRNA.

RNAi constructs aimed at silencing the BRCA2 genes at meiosis triggered a reproducible sterility phenotype. which was associated with dramatic meiosis alterations. We obtained the same phenotype upon introduction of RNAi constructs aimed at silencing the RAD51 gene at meiosis in dmc1 mutant plants. The meiotic figures we observed strongly suggest that homologous recombination is highly disturbed in these meiotic cells. leaving aberrant recombination events to repair the meiotic double‐strand breaks. The ‘brca2’ meiotic phenotype was eliminated in spo11 mutant plants. Our experiments point to an essential role of Brca2 at meiosis in …,True,jAF4QZsAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,199,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600146,9439199562693951399,/scholar?cites=9439199562693951399,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1038/sj.emboj.7600146,0,0,0

The tumor suppressors BRCA2 and PALB2 act together to deliver RAD51 to chromosomal lesions to initiate repair. Here we document a new function of PALB2: to enhance RAD51's ability to form the D loop. We show that PALB2 binds DNA and physically interacts with RAD51. Notably. although PALB2 alone stimulates D-loop formation. it has a cooperative effect with RAD51AP1. an enhancer of RAD51.

RAD51AP1-depleted cells are impaired for the recombinational repair of a DNA double-strand break and exhibit chromatid breaks both spontaneously and upon DNA-damaging treatment.

Components of the cell membrane are involved in many important biological processes. including viral infection. blood clotting. and signal transduction. and as such. they are common targets of therapeutic agents. Therefore. the development of analytical approaches to study interactions at the cell membrane is of critical importance. Herein. we integrate two key technologies. silicon photonic microring resonator arrays and phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs. which together allow multiplexed screening of soluble protein interactions with lipid and membrane-embedded targets.

Proteins in the membrane have co-evolved with their hydrophobic lipid environment. which serves as a solvent for proteins with very diverse requirements. As a result. their interactions range from non-selective to highly discriminating. Mass spectrometry enables us to monitor how lipids interact with membrane proteins and assess their effects on structure and dynamics. Recent studies illustrate the ability to differentiate specific lipid binding. preferential interactions with lipid subsets. and nonselective annular contacts. Here. we consider the biological implications of different lipid-binding scenarios and propose that binding occurs on a sliding selectivity scale. in line with the view of biological membranes as facilitators of dynamic protein and lipid organization.,True,hTpHqCYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,43,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X16300343,9244402702137917875,/scholar?cites=9244402702137917875,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959440X16300343,0,0,0

Drug entry to the CNS also depends on the physicochemical properties of the substances. which can be metabolised during this transport to pharmacologically inactive. non-penetrating polar products.

Activation of myofibroblasts plays a central role in fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a potent activator of myofibroblasts; namely. TGF-β causes changes in myofibroblast phenotypes including morphological alterations and the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). a marker of myofibroblasts. Because it has been well known that humoral factors. especially. TGF-β. and extracellular matrix components cause myofibroblast activation. we examined the expression of integrin and related proteins during activation of MRC-5 human myofibroblasts with TGF-β. Western blot analysis revealed that TGF-β treatment for 3 days increased the expression of α-SMA. which was also immunocytochemically observed as actin stress fibers. In the early phase of TGF-β treatment. fibronectin expression was greatly increased. followed by the increased expression of integrin αv and α11 and integrin β1 and β3. Coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that the integrin αv subunit was co-precipitated with integrin β1 and β3. and that integrin β1 was co-precipitated with α11. αv. α2. and α5. The expression of focal adhesion kinase and integrin-linked kinase proteins was also upregulated by treatment with TGF-β. In addition. the expression of type I collagen mRNA was increased by TGF-β. but not type III collagen mRNA. as judged by real-time PCR analysis. These results suggest the possibility that TGF-β induces fibronectin expression in MRC-5 cells. which subsequently induces the expression of integrin receptors. αvβ3. αvβ1. and α11β1.

We investigated whether the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) binding to lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) upregulates VEGF expression in cultured bovine articular chondrocytes (BACs). Ox-LDL markedly increased VEGF mRNA expression and protein release in time- and dose-dependent manners. which was significantly suppressed by anti-LOX-1 antibody pretreatment.

Peripheral T-cell function in the cuprizone model has already been explored; therefore. in the present study. we investigated. for the first time. how cuprizone feeding affects the thymus. the organ of T-cell maturation and selection. We found that even one week of cuprizone treatment induced significant thymic atrophy. affecting the cortex over the medulla. Fluorescent microscopy and flow-cytometric analyses of thymi from cuprizone- and vehicle-treated mice indicated that eradication of the cluster of the differentiation-4 (CD4)-CD8 double-positive T-cell subset was behind the substantial cell loss. This result was confirmed with CD3-CD4-CD8 triple-staining experiments. Ultrastructurally. we observed degraded as well as enlarged mitochondria. myelin-bodies. large lipid droplets. and large lysosomes in the thymi of cuprizone-treated mice. Some of these features were similar to those in physiological and steroid-induced accelerated aging.

Inc.,Genome engineering with designer nucleases is a rapidly progressing field. and the ability to correct human gene mutations in situ is highly desirable. We employed fibroblasts derived from a patient with Fanconi anemia as a model to test the ability of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 nuclease system to mediate gene correction.

Here we report on the next stage of this strategy: the redesign of HEGs with customized specificity in order to drive HEG-induced ‘homing’ in vivo via break-induced homologous recombination. Variants targeting a sequence within the Anopheles AGAP004734 gene were created from the recently characterized I-OnuI endonuclease. and tested for cleavage activity and frequency of homing using a model Drosophila HEG drive system. We observed cleavage and homing at an integrated reporter for all endonuclease variants tested. demonstrating for the first time that engineered HEGs can cleave their target site in insect germline cells. promoting targeted mutagenesis and homing. However. in comparison to our previously reported work with I-SceI. the engineered I-OnuI variants mediated homing with a reduced frequency. suggesting that site-specific cleavage activity is insufficient by itself to ensure efficient homing.

Chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders lead to the over-expression of Kv1.3 in T cells. To quantitatively study the regulatory mechanism and physiological function of Kv1.3 in T cells. it is necessary to have a precise kinetic model of Kv1.3.

These transmembrane receptors regulate the direct association of cells with each other and with extracellular matrix proteins. However. by binding their ligands. integrins provide a transmembrane link for the bidirectional transmission of mechanical forces and biochemical signals across the plasma membrane. Interestingly. several of this family of receptors are exploited by pathogens to establish contact with the host cells.

Kidney disease encompasses acute (short-lasting episode) and chronic (developing over years) pathologies both leading to renal failure. Since specific treatments for acute or chronic kidney disease are limited. more than 2 million people a year require dialysis or kidney transplantation. Several recent evidences identified lysosomal proteases cathepsins as key players in kidney pathophysiology. Cathepsins. originally found in the lysosomes. exert important functions also in the cytosol and nucleus of cells as well as in the extracellular space. thus participating in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Based on their catalytic active site residue. the 15 human cathepsins identified up to now are classified in three different families: serine (cathepsins A and G). aspartate (cathepsins D and E). or cysteine (cathepsins B. C. F. H. K. L. O. S. V. X. and W) proteases. Specifically in the kidney. cathepsins B. D. L and S have been shown to regulate extracellular matrix homeostasis. autophagy. apoptosis. glomerular permeability. endothelial function. and inflammation. Dysregulation of their expression/activity has been associated to the onset and progression of kidney disease. This review summarizes most of the recent findings that highlight the critical role of cathepsins in kidney disease development and progression.

Metastasis formation is a multistep process that requires acquisition by tumor cells of a malignant phenotype that allows them to escape from the primary tumor site and invade other organs. Each step of this mechanism involves a deep crosstalk between tumor cells and their microenvironment where the host cells play a key role in influencing metastatic behavior through the release of many secreted factors. Among these signaling molecules. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) is released by many cell types of the tumor microenvironment to target its receptor c-MET within the cells of the primary tumor. Many studies reveal that HGF/c-MET axis is implicated in various human cancers. and genetic and epigenetic gain of functions of this signaling contributes to cancer development through a variety of mechanisms. In this review. we describe the specific types of cells in the tumor microenvironment that release HGF in order to promote the metastatic outgrowth through the activation of extracellular matrix remodeling. inflammation. migration. angiogenesis. and invasion. We dissect the potential use of new molecules that interfere with the HGF/c-MET axis as therapeutic targets for future clinical trials in cancer disease.

The plant Ca2+ serves as secondary messenger during adaptations to stressful conditions and developmental processes. A plethora of Ca2+ sensors and decoders functions to bring about these changes. The cellular concentrations of Ca2+. their subcellular localization. and the specific interaction affinities of Ca2+ decoder proteins all work together to make this process a complex but synchronized signaling network.

Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as a model for C. albicans. it lacks C. albicans' diverse morphogenic forms and is primarily non-pathogenic. Comprehensive genetic analyses that have been instrumental for determining gene function in S. cerevisiae are hampered in C. albicans. due in part to limited resources to systematically assay phenotypes of loss-of-function alleles. Here. we constructed and screened a library of 3633 tagged heterozygous transposon disruption mutants. using them in a competitive growth assay to examine nutrient- and drug-dependent haploinsufficiency. We identified 269 genes that were haploinsufficient in four growth conditions. the majority of which were condition-specific. These screens identified two new genes necessary for filamentous growth as well as ten genes that function in essential processes. We also screened 57 chemically diverse compounds that more potently inhibited growth of C. albicans versus S. cerevisiae. For four of these compounds. we examined the genetic basis of this differential inhibition. Notably. Sec7p was identified as the target of brefeldin A in C. albicans screens. while S. cerevisiae screens with this compound failed to identify this target. We also uncovered a new C. albicans-specific target. Tfp1p. for the synthetic compound 0136-0228.

Recent expression-profiling experiments using microarrays have provided insight into the co-ordinated transcription of several hundred genes during mitotic growth and meiotic development in budding and fission yeast. Furthermore. microarray-based studies have identified numerous loci that are regulated during the cell cycle or expressed in a germ-cell specific manner in eukaryotic model systems like Caenorhabditis elegans. Mus musculus as well as Homo sapiens. The unprecedented amount of information produced by post-genome biology has spawned novel approaches to organizing biological knowledge using currently available information technology. This review outlines experiments that contribute to an emerging comprehensive picture of the molecular machinery governing sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.During meiosis a competent diploid cell replicates its DNA once and then undergoes two consecutive divisions followed by haploid gamete differentiation. Important aspects of meiotic development that distinguish it from mitotic growth include a highly increased rate of recombination. formation of the synaptonemal complex that aligns the homologous chromosomes. as well as separation of the homologues and sister chromatids during meiosis I and II without an intervening S-phase.

However.

This conversion is not readily observed in aerobic. shaken cultures or static cultures containing the alternative electron acceptor nitrate. In this study. it is shown that the non-mucoid variants that arise under static growth conditions are almost exclusively algT mutants. It has been shown that AlgT not only positively regulates alginate biosynthesis. but also directly or indirectly negatively regulates flagellum synthesis. Indeed. during static growth. conversion to the non-mucoid phenotype is accompanied by the acquisition of flagellum-mediated motility.

Analysis of these interactions by structural techniques is. however. challenging due to inherent limitations of the techniques and because many of the interactions are transient. and suitable complexes are difficult to isolate. In particular. structural studies of large protein complexes by traditional solution NMR methods are difficult due to a priori requirement of extensive assignments and a large number of intermolecular restraints for the complex.

Shrimp culture is one of the subsectors of aquaculture that attracts more attention because of the economic interest. However. the shrimp culture systems have been facing severe consequences and economical losses due to disease outbreaks. Risk of disease outbreak can be combated with the application of probiotics. For economically viable production of such probiotic products. the present study provides information on the optimization and partial purification of bacteriocin produced by a goat milk isolate Lactobacillus sp. MSU3IR against the shrimp bacterial pathogens. Bacteriocin production was estimated as a measure of bactericidal activity (arbitrary Unit/ml) over the test strains. The optimum culture conditions and media components for maximum bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus sp. MSU3IR were: pH: 5.0. temperature: 30°C. carbon source: lactose; nitrogen source: ammonium acetate; NaCl: 3.0% and surfactant: Tween 80.

It induces worm muscle contractions and tegumental disruption. followed by exposure of parasite surface membrane antigens to the host immunological defence mechanisms. It may be assumed that PZQ. like cholesterol. is too hydrophobic to traverse the schistosome outer lipid bilayers by passive diffusion and probably requires binding to a surface membrane protein carrier for distribution throughout the worm. However. the PZQ binding site on the schistosome surface and the precise mechanism of action are not yet known. The Claisen condensation reaction was used to bind PZQ on cellulose acetate membranes.

Present disease control depends on treatment with the only available drug praziquantel. No vaccine exists despite the intense search for molecular candidates and adjuvant formulations over the last three decades. Cysteine peptidases such as papain and Der p 1 are well known environmental allergens that sensitize the immune system driving potent Th2-responses. Recently. we showed that the administration of active papain to mice induced significant protection (P<0.02. 50%) against an experimental challenge infection with Schistosoma mansoni. Since schistosomes express and secrete papain-like cysteine peptidases we reasoned that these could be employed as vaccines with inbuilt adjuvanticity to protect against these parasites. Here we demonstrate that sub-cutaneous injection of functionally active S. mansoni cathepsin B1 (SmCB1). or a cathepsin L from a related parasite Fasciola hepatica (FhCL1). elicits highly significant (P<0.0001) protection (up to 73%) against an experimental challenge worm infection.

The best producer. Rhizopus microsporus NRRL 3671. was used for optimizing the process parameters for enzyme production. Fermentation carried out with 44.44 % initial moisture content at a temperature of 30 C for 72 h was found to be the optimum for enzyme secretion by the fermenting organism. While most of the carbon supplements favored enzyme production. addition of casein resulted in a marginal increase in protease yield. Fermentation was then carried out under optimized conditions to obtain the crude extract of the enzyme. which was partially purified by precipitation and dialysis. A 3-fold increase in the enzyme purity was achieved in this manner.

In this study. we examined the effects of the peripheral-type benzodiazepines on murine thymocytes. Murine thymocytes that were incubated with the peripheral-type benzodiazepines underwent apoptosis associated with the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δφ m). The drugs stimulated dexamethasone-and etoposide-induced apoptosis with the enhanced collapse of Δφ m. The central-type benzodiazepines had no effect on either the Δφ m or apoptosis. The reduction of Δφ m depended on protein synthesis and protein phosphorylation.

The Flavonoids genistein. biochanin A. and apigenin inhibited topoisomerase II to the same extent as etoposide. a specific inhibitor of the enzyme. Methyl 2. 5-dihydroxycinnamate (2. 5-MeC) also inhibited topoisomerase II. but was less potent than genistein. Herbimycin A and staurosporine did not inhibit topoisomerase II. None of the inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases examined inhibited topoisomerase I activity. All the inhibitors induced cell death with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the presence of IL-2. Genistein. biochanin A. and apigenin induced DNA fragmentation and cell death early in the incuba tion period and did not alter the profiles of phosphotyrosine proteins in either the lysate or pelleted fractions. indicating that the early cell death was induced by the inhibition of topoisomerase II activity rather than by the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase activity. 2. 5-MeC similarly induced early cell death and DNA fragmentation. but to a lesser extent than genistein presumably due to the inhibition of topoisomerase II activity. Herbimycin A induced a slow increase in DNA fragmentation and cell death. accompanied by a decrease in phosphotyrosine proteins in the pelleted fraction. suggesting that the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. presumably of the nuclear proteins. is related to cell death and DNA fragmentation.

Here. an attempt has been made to understand structure-function relationships among the members of this diverse superfamily and identify the principles governing functional diversity. The cupin superfamily also contains proteins for which the structures are available through world-wide structural genomics initiatives but characterized as “hypothetical”. We have explored the feasibility of obtaining clues to functions of such proteins by means of comparative analysis with cupins of known structure and function.  Methodology/Principal Findings A 3-D structure-based phylogenetic approach was undertaken. Interestingly. a dendrogram generated solely on the basis of structural dissimilarity measure at the level of domain folds was found to cluster functionally similar members. This clustering also reflects an independent evolution of the two domains in bicupins. Close examination of structural superposition of members across various functional clusters reveals structural variations in regions that not only form the active site pocket but are also involved in interaction with another domain in the same polypeptide or in the oligomer.  Conclusions/Significance Structure-based phylogeny of cupins can influence identification of functions of proteins of yet unknown function with cupin fold.

Here we demonstrate that RslA binds Zn2+ and can sequester σL in a reducing environment. In response to an oxidative stimulus. proximal cysteines in the CXXC motif of RslA form a disulfide bond. releasing bound Zn2+.

The extracytoplasmic function (ECF) σ factor σK governs the transcription of the serodominant antigens MPT70 and MPT83. The cellular levels of σK are regulated by the membrane-associated anti-σK (RskA) that localizes σK in an inactive complex. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis σK in complex with the cytosolic domain of RskA (RskAcyto) revealed a disulfide bridge in the −35 promoter-interaction region of σK. Biochemical experiments reveal that the redox potential of the disulfide-forming cysteines in σK is consistent with its role as a sensor.

The nature of the copper active site in the primary metabolic enzyme of these bacteria. particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO). has been controversial owing to seemingly contradictory biochemical. spectroscopic. and crystallographic results. We present biochemical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization most consistent with two monocopper sites within pMMO: one in the soluble PmoB subunit at the previously assigned active site (CuB) and one ~2 nanometers away in the membrane-bound PmoC subunit (CuC).

The few studies investigating oral route infection disregard that inoculation in the oral cavity (Oral infection. OI) or by gavage (Gastrointestinal infection. GI) represent different infection routes. yet both show clear-cut parasitemia and heart parasitism during the acute infection. Herein. BALB/c mice were subjected to acute OI or GI infection using 5x104 culture-derived Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes. OI mice displayed higher parasitemia and mortality rates than their GI counterparts. Heart histopathology showed larger areas of infiltration in the GI mice. whereas liver lesions were more severe in the OI animals. accompanied by higher Alanine Transaminase and Aspartate Transaminase serum contents. A differential cytokine pattern was also observed because OI mice presented higher pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ. TNF) serum levels than GI animals. Real-time PCR confirmed a higher TNF. IFN-γ. as well as IL-10 expression in the cardiac tissue from the OI group compared with GI. Conversely. TGF-β and IL-17 serum levels were greater in the GI animals.

High nitric oxide (NO) levels have been shown to be associated with cardiomyopathy severity in patients. Further. NO produced via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS/NOS2) is proposed to play a role in Trypanosoma cruzi control. However. the participation of iNOS/NOS2 and NO in T. cruzi control and heart injury has been questioned. Here. using chronically infected rhesus monkeys and iNOS/NOS2-deficient (Nos2−/−) mice we explored the participation of iNOS/NOS2-derived NO in heart injury in T. cruzi infection.   Methodology Rhesus monkeys and C57BL/6 and Nos2−/− mice were infected with the Colombian T. cruzi strain. Parasite DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction. T. cruzi antigens and iNOS/NOS2+ cells were immunohistochemically detected in heart sections and NO levels in serum were determined by Griess reagent.

The overall fold is similar to that of ferrous lipid-bound Alcaligenes eutrophusflavohemoglobin with the notable exception of the E helix positioning within the globin domain and a rotation of the NAD binding module with respect to the FAD-binding domain accompanied by a substantial rearrangement of the C-terminal region. An inspection of the heme environment in E. coli flavohemoglobin reveals an unexpected architecture of the distal pocket. In fact. the distal site is occupied by the isopropyl side chain Leu-E11 that shields the heme iron from the residues in the topological positions predicted to interact with heme iron-bound ligands. namely Tyr-B10 and Gln-E7. and stabilizes a pentacoordinate ferric iron species.

Previous work has implicated oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the etiology of ALD; however. the complex and interrelated nature of these cellular responses presently confounds our understanding of ethanol-induced hepatopathy.

The reactivity of 4-HNE towards DNA and nucleophilic amino acids has been well established. In this report. using proteomic approaches. liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is identified as a target for modification by 4-HNE. This lipid binding protein mediates the uptake and trafficking of hydrophobic ligands throughout cellular compartments. Ethanol caused a significant decrease in L-FABP protein (P<0.001) and mRNA (P<0.05). as well as increased poly-ubiquitinated L-FABP (P<0.001). Sites of 4-HNE adduction on mouse recombinant L-FABP were mapped using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry on apo (Lys57 and Cys69) and holo (Lys6. Lys31. His43. Lys46. Lys57 and Cys69) L-FABP. The impact of 4-HNE adduction was found to occur in a concentration-dependent manner; affinity for the fluorescent ligand. anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. was reduced from 0.347 µM to Kd1 = 0.395 µM and Kd2 = 34.20 µM. Saturation analyses revealed that capacity for ligand is reduced by approximately 50% when adducted by 4-HNE. Thermal stability curves of apo L-FABP was also found to be significantly affected by 4-HNE adduction (ΔTm = 5.44°C. P<0.01).

The family is divided into three classes: multiregion proapoptotic proteins that directly permeabilize the MOM; BH3 proteins that directly or indirectly activate the pore-forming class members; and the antiapoptotic proteins that inhibit this process at several steps. Different experimental approaches have led to several models. each proposed to explain the interactions between Bcl-2 family proteins. The discovery that many of these interactions occur at or in membranes as well as in the cytoplasm. and are governed by the concentrations and relative binding affinities of the proteins. provides a new basis for rationalizing these models.

1036893,Drugs targeting Bcl-2 family members as an emerging strategy in cancer,2010,Brian Leber and Fei Geng and Justin Kale and David W Andrews,12,,,,Cambridge University Press,Inhibiting apoptosis is widely accepted as a necessary step in the transition from normal to cancer cells. and most cancer therapies exert their effects by indirectly reversing this process. Commitment to apoptosis is caused by permeabilisation of the outer mitochondrial membrane–a process regulated by the binding between different members of the Bcl-2 family. Furthermore. Bcl-2 family members also bind to the endoplasmic reticulum. where they modify processes such as the unfolded-protein response and autophagy that also cause or modify different types of cell death. With the growing understanding of the importance of the Bcl-2 family as crucial regulators of the decision to initiate apoptosis. much effort has been directed at developing small molecules that modify function by directly binding to Bcl-2 proteins. Preclinical experiments have confirmed that these agents kill cancer cells and overcome chemotherapy resistance. Two of these drugs are in the initial stages of clinical development (ABT-263 and obatoclax). and early results show clinical efficacy at tolerable doses. Important questions for the future include the role of these drugs as monotherapy versus combination therapy with other anticancer drugs. and the related issue of the relative toxicity to cancerous versus normal cells.Tumours develop from normal cells when they sustain unrepaired mutations that directly or indirectly cause defects in the regulatory pathways that control cellular proliferation and homeostasis.

1036908,[25] Nonspecific ligand-DNA equilibrium binding parameters determined by fluorescence methods,1992,Timothy M Lohman and David P Mascotti,212,,,424-458,Academic Press,This chapter focuses on the use of steady-state fluorescence techniques to monitor changes in the ligand (protein) that accompany binding. with examples drawn from studies of ligands and proteins that bind nonspecifically to nucleic acids. Spectroscopic methods—such as fluorescence. UV absorbance. and circular dichroism—offer many advantages for the study of ligand–nucleic acid as well as other macromolecular interactions. To use a change in a spectroscopic signal that is induced on formation of a ligand–nucleic acid complex to obtain a true equilibrium binding isotherm. either the relationship between the signal change and the degree of binding must be known or a method of analysis must be used that does not require knowledge of this relationship. If some relationship between the signal change and the degree of binding is assumed (e.g.. linear). then the resulting binding isotherm …,True,cX_iBVcAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,90,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/007668799212027N,16893265925429437654,/scholar?cites=16893265925429437654,,,0,0,0

Mediation of these binding interactions by iron and iron-containing compounds regulates several post-transcriptional events relevant to iron metabolism. There are two known IRPs. IRP1 and IRP2. both of which can respond to iron fluxes in the cell. There is ample evidence that IRP1 is converted by iron to cytoplasmic aconitase in vivo. It has also been shown that. under certain conditions. a significant fraction of IRP1 is degraded in cells exposed to iron or heme. Studies have shown that the degradation of IRP1 that is induced by iron can be inhibited by either desferrioxamine mesylate (an iron chelator) or succinyl acetone (an inhibitor of heme synthesis). whereas the degradation induced by heme cannot. This suggests that heme rather than iron is responsible for this degradation.Several laboratories have …,True,cX_iBVcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819842965,7591607439130353171,/scholar?cites=7591607439130353171,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819842965,0,0,0

In one. the biotin tethers the RNA to streptavidin–agarose beads. creating an affinity resin for protein purification. In the other. the biotin functions as a label for use in a modified chemiluminescent electromobility shift assay (EMSA). a technique used to detect the formation of protein–RNA complexes. The EMSA that we describe avoids the use not only of radioactivity but also of neurotoxic acrylamide by using agarose as the gel matrix in which the free nucleic acid is separated from protein–nucleic acid complexes. After separation of free from complexed RNA in agarose. the RNA is electroblotted to positively charged nylon.

The SA tetramer is also known to exhibit significant stability. even in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS). Despite its importance. relatively little is known about the nature of the thermal denaturation pathway for SA. This work uses a homogeneous SA preparation to expand on the data of previous literature reports. leading to the proposal of a model for temperature induced structural changes in SA. Temperature dependent data were obtained by SDS and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). and fluorescence and ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy in the presence and absence of SDS. In addition to the development of this model. it is found that the major thermal transition of SA in 1% SDS is reversible.

1036968,Phosphinic acid compounds in biochemistry. biology and medicine,2000,M Collinsova and J Jiracek,7,,6,629-647,Bentham Science Publishers,This review summarizes our knowledge of biochemical. biological and medical applications and properties of phosphinic acid compounds. Phosphinic acid compounds (phosphinates) are derivatives of phosphinic acid H 2 P(O)(OH). The major attention of this article is focused on applications of phosphinates of a pseudopeptide character. however interesting examples of phosphinates of a non-peptide nature are mentioned too. Phosphinic acid peptides (phosphinic pseudopeptides) are peptide isosteres where one peptide bond is substituted by the nonhydrolysable phosphinate moiety -P(O)(OH)-CH 2 - or -P(O)(OH)-. This substitution represents a very convenient mimic of a substrate in the transition state for at least two distinct classes of hydrolytic enzymes. Zn-metalloproteinases and aspartic acid proteinases. In this review we discuss about thirty different protein targets for which the phosphinates have found …,True,QtxiJlIAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,250,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cmc/2000/00000007/00000006/art00003,4363244395062702608,/scholar?cites=4363244395062702608,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiri_Jiracek/publication/12612340_Phosphinic_Acid_Compounds_in_Biochemistry_Biology_and_Medicine/links/54aab2a30cf25c4c472f47c4/Phosphinic-Acid-Compounds-in-Biochemistry-Biology-and-Medicine.pdf,0,0,0

All of the synthetic inhibitors of this enzyme used in clinical applications interact with these two active sites to a similar extent. Recently. several lines of evidence have suggested that the N-terminal active site of ACE might be involved in specific hydrolysis of some important physiological substrates. like Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Lysyl-Proline. a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. These findings have stimulated studies aimed at identifying new ACE inhibitors able to block only one of the two active sites of this enzyme.

In cells. SOS-Ras signaling is thought to be initiated predominantly by membrane recruitment of SOS via the adaptor Grb2 and balanced by rapidly reversible Grb2-SOS binding kinetics. However. SOS has multiple protein and lipid interactions that provide linkage to the membrane. In reconstituted-membrane experiments. these Grb2-independent interactions were sufficient to retain human SOS on the membrane for many minutes. during which a single SOS molecule could processively activate thousands of Ras molecules.

Initially. BCG was proposed to work through an inflammatory response. mediated by phagocytic uptake of mycobacterial antigens and cytokine release. More recently. other immune effectors such as monocytes. Natural Killer (NK) and NKT cells have been suggested to play a role in this immune response. Here. we provide a comprehensive study of multiple bladder cancer cell lines as putative targets for immune cells and evaluated their recognition by NK cells in the presence and absence of BCG. We describe that different bladder cancer cells can express multiple activating and inhibitory ligands for NK cells. Recognition of bladder cancer cells depended mainly on NKG2D. with a contribution from NKp46. Surprisingly. exposure to BCG did not affect the immune phenotype of bladder cells nor increased NK cell recognition of purified IL-2-activated cell lines. However. NK cells were activated efficiently when BCG was included in mixed lymphocyte cultures. suggesting that NK activation after mycobacteria treatment requires the collaboration of various immune cells. We also analyzed the percentage of NK cells in peripheral blood of a cohort of bladder cancer patients treated with BCG.

Key macromolecules in this interplay are syndecans (SDCs). a family of transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Specifically. heparan sulfate (HS) chains with their different sulfation pattern have the ability to interact with growth factors and their receptors in tumor microenvironment. promoting the activation of different signaling cascades that regulate tumor cell behavior. The affinity of HS chains with ligands is altered during malignant conditions because of the modification of chain sequence/sulfation pattern. Furthermore. matrix degradation enzymes derived from the tumor itself or the tumor microenvironment. like heparanase and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). ADAM as well as ADΑMTS are involved in the cleavage of SDCs ectodomain at the HS and protein core level. respectively. Such released soluble syndecans “shed syndecans” in the extracellular matrix interact in an autocrine or paracrine manner with the tumor or/and stromal cells. Shed syndecans. upon binding to several matrix effectors. such as growth factors. chemokines and cytokines. have the ability to act as competitive inhibitors for membrane PGs. and modulate the inflammatory microenvironment of cancer cells. It is notable that syndecans and their soluble counterparts may affect either the behavior of cancer cells and/or their microenvironment during cancer progression.

Powering RNA turnover and quality control. the degradosome serves also as a machine for processing structured RNA precursors during their maturation. The capacity to switch between destructive and processing modes involves cooperation between degradosome components and is analogous to the process of RNA surveillance in other domains of life. Recruitment of components and cellular compartmentalisation of the degradosome are mediated through small recognition domains that punctuate a natively unstructured segment within a scaffolding core. Dynamic in conformation. variable in composition and non-essential under certain laboratory conditions. the degradosome has nonetheless been maintained throughout the evolution of many bacterial species. due most likely to its diverse contributions in global cellular regulation. We describe the role of the degradosome and its components in RNA decay pathways in E. coli. and we broadly compare these pathways in other bacteria as well as archaea and eukaryotes. We discuss the modular architecture and molecular evolution of the degradosome. its roles in RNA degradation. processing and quality control surveillance. and how its activity is regulated by non-coding RNA.

The activity of RNase E is inhibited by the protein RraA. which can interact with the ribonuclease's degradosome-scaffolding domain. Here. we report that RraA can bind to the RNA helicase component of the degradosome (RhlB) and the two RNA-binding sites in the degradosome-scaffolding domain of RNase E. In the presence of ATP. the helicase can facilitate the exchange of RraA for RNA stably bound to the degradosome. Our data suggest that RraA can affect multiple components of the RNA degradosome in a dynamic. energy-dependent equilibrium.

The molecular mechanism of IFIT anti-viral activity has been studied in some detail. including the recently discovered direct binding of viral nucleic acid. the binding to viral and host proteins. and the possible involvement in anti-viral immune signal propagation. The unique structures of some members of the IFIT family have been solved to reveal an internal pocket for non-sequence-specific. but conformation- and modification-specific. nucleic acid binding.

1037044,The SH2 domain regulates c-Abl kinase activation by a cyclin-like mechanism and remodulation of the hinge motion,2014,Nicole Dölker and Maria W Górna and Ludovico Sutto and Antonio S Torralba and Giulio Superti-Furga and Francesco L Gervasio,10,PLoS Comput Biol,10,e1003863,Public Library of Science,Regulation of the c-Abl (ABL1) tyrosine kinase is important because of its role in cellular signaling. and its relevance in the leukemiogenic counterpart (BCR-ABL). Both auto-inhibition and full activation of c-Abl are regulated by the interaction of the catalytic domain with the Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain. The mechanism by which this interaction enhances catalysis is not known. We combined computational simulations with mutagenesis and functional analysis to find that the SH2 domain conveys both local and global effects on the dynamics of the catalytic domain. Locally. it regulates the flexibility of the αC helix in a fashion reminiscent of cyclins in cyclin-dependent kinases. reorienting catalytically important motifs. At a more global level. SH2 binding redirects the hinge motion of the N and C lobes and changes the conformational equilibrium of the activation loop. The complex network of subtle structural shifts that link the SH2 domain with the activation loop and the active site may be partially conserved with other SH2-domain containing kinases and therefore offer additional parameters for the design of conformation-specific inhibitors.,True,4wv0vkgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,22,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003863,9252709562010297949,/scholar?cites=9252709562010297949,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003863,0,0,0

There are few studies of AT determination in animals. We describe a protocol for AT determination by the ""lactate minimum test"" in rats during swimming exercise. The test is based on the premise that during an incremental exercise test. and after a bout of maximal exercise. blood lactate decreases to a minimum and then increases again. This minimum value indicates the intensity of the AT. Adult male (90 days) Wistar rats adapted to swimming for 2 weeks were used. The initial state of lactic acidosis was obtained by making the animals jump into the water and swim while carrying a load equivalent to 50% of body weight for 6 min (30-s exercise interrupted by a 30-s rest). After a 9-min rest. blood was collected and the incremental swimming test was started. The test consisted of swimming while supporting loads of 4.5. 5.0. 5.5. 6.0 and 7.0% of body weight. Each exercise load lasted 5 min and was followed by a 30-s rest during which blood samples were taken. The blood lactate minimum was determined from a zero-gradient tangent to a spline function fitting the blood lactate vs workload curve. AT was estimated to be 4.95 ± 0.10% of body weight while interpolated blood lactate was 7.17 ± 0.16 mmol/l.

We separated 48 Wistar rats into two groups according to diet: a control group (balanced diet AIN-93 G) and a fructose-rich diet group (60% fructose). The animals were tested for maximal lactate-steady state (MLSS) in order to identify the aerobic/anaerobic metabolic transition during swimming exercises at 28 and 90 days of age. One third of the animals of each group were submitted to swimming training at an intensity equivalent to the individual MLSS for 1 hours/day. 5 days/week from 28 to 120 days (early protocol).

Thirteen male HIFT practitioners (age 27.2±33 years. height 177.1±4.0 cm. body mass 81.1±9.0 kg) were monitored during two common HIFT training sessions: Fight Gone Bad (FGB) and Fran. The Edwards summated heart-rate-zone method was used as a reference measure of internal training load. The session-RPE rating was obtained using the CR-10 scale modified by Foster. The training load calculated by the Edwards-TRIMP index was significantly higher (p< 0.05) during the FGB (77.7±4.9) than the Fran (19.8±8.4) workout. There was a strong correlation (p< 0.05) between the Edwards-TRIMP index and the training load calculated by the sRPE in all time frames (0. 10. 20. and 30 min post-exercise). The RPE and sRPE measured at 30 min post-exercise time frame was significant lower than 0. 10. and 20 min post-exercise for both workouts.

The functions of Tβs appear to be pleiotrophic. including actin-remodeling. wound healing. angiogenesis. etc. In the present study. we present the evidence that Tβs have anti-apoptotic activity on developing chick motoneurons (MNs) in vivo. Using in ovo electroporation. we introduced three isoforms of Tβ (Tβ4. Tβ10. and Tβ15) and found the significantly diminished normal and limb bud removal (LBR)-induced programmed cell death. Such anti-apoptotic activity is independent of Tβ’s actin remodeling activity. On the other hand. overexpression of Tβs substantially reduced early cell death initiation signal. such as phosphorylation of c-Jun. Collectively. these results suggest that Tβs may prevent apoptosis of neurons via blockade of early apoptogenic signals independent of actin remodeling action.,True,o9AjaHIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,33,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X06012642,1133216791054594610,/scholar?cites=1133216791054594610,,,0,0,0

1037077,The regulation of elongation by eukaryotic RNA polymerase II: a recent view,2001,Dong-ki Kim and Yuki Yamaguchi and Tadashi Wada and Hiroshi Handa,11,,3,267-274,THE KOREAN SOCIETY FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,The elongation of mRNA by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is controlled by the diverse actions of cis-and trans-acting elements that respond to a variety of biological signals. Elongation regulation. which determines the processivity of RNAPII. occurs during the steps of transcription initiation and elongation through both negative and positive influences. It has been generally accepted that negative elongation factors repress the elongation reaction. It is also generally accepted that positive elongation factors act by allowing the stalled RNAPII to escape from an inactive state. thus facilitating the production of full-length transcripts. However. recent data suggests that these opposing regulatory mechanisms can be achieved through a coupling pattern. rather than through independent activity. In addition. biochemical experiments using 5. 6-dichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (DRB) have identified several factors involved in DRB-sensitive transcription. and elucidated the mechanism of interplay between the positive and negative elongation factors. Here. we will review the major findings from studies on RNAPII elongation control.

1037080,A Pareto-optimal refinement method for protein design scaffolds,2013,Lucas Gregorio Nivón and Rocco Moretti and David Baker,8,PloS one,4,e59004,Public Library of Science,Computational design of protein function involves a search for amino acids with the lowest energy subject to a set of constraints specifying function. In many cases a set of natural protein backbone structures. or “scaffolds”. are searched to find regions where functional sites (an enzyme active site. ligand binding pocket. protein – protein interaction region. etc.) can be placed. and the identities of the surrounding amino acids are optimized to satisfy functional constraints. Input native protein structures almost invariably have regions that score very poorly with the design force field. and any design based on these unmodified structures may result in mutations away from the native sequence solely as a result of the energetic strain. Because the input structure is already a stable protein. it is desirable to keep the total number of mutations to a minimum and to avoid mutations resulting from poorly-scoring input structures. Here we describe a protocol using cycles of minimization with combined backbone/sidechain restraints that is Pareto-optimal with respect to RMSD to the native structure and energetic strain reduction.

Sequence analyses show that the V- and F-ATPases evolved from the same enzyme that was already present in the last common ancestor of all known extant life forms. The catalytic and non-catalytic subunits found in the dissociable head groups of both V-ATPases and F-ATPases are paralogous subunits. i.e. these two types of subunits evolved from a common ancestral gene.

AP-1 recruitment to these compartments requires Arf1-GTP. The crystal structure of the tetrameric core of AP-1 in complex with Arf1-GTP. together with biochemical analyses. shows that Arf1 activates cargo binding by unlocking AP-1. Unlocking is driven by two molecules of Arf1 that bridge two copies of AP-1 at two interaction sites. The GTP-dependent switch I and II regions of Arf1 bind to the N terminus of the β1 subunit of one AP-1 complex. while the back side of Arf1 binds to the central part of the γ subunit trunk of a second AP-1 complex.

The structural basis for the hijacking of AP-2 by Nef is revealed by a 2.9 Å crystal structure of Nef bound to the α and σ2 subunits of AP-2. Nef binds to AP-2 via its central loop (residues 149–179) and its core. The determinants for Nef binding include residues that directly contact AP-2 and others that stabilize the binding-competent conformation of the central loop. Residues involved in both direct and indirect interactions are required for the binding of Nef to AP-2 and for downregulation of CD4. These results lead to a model for the docking of the full AP-2 tetramer to membranes as bound to Nef. such that the cytosolic tail of CD4 is situated to interact with its binding site on Nef.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01754.001,True,TdZgRX8AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,86,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01754,7936935230468669632,/scholar?cites=7936935230468669632,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/01754.pdf,0,0,0

1037112,Nitric oxide synthase in plants: where do we stand?,2017,Jérôme Santolini and François André and Sylvain Jeandroz and David Wendehenne,63,,,30-38,Academic Press,Over the past twenty years. nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as an important player in various plant physiological processes. Although many advances in the understanding of NO functions have been made. the question of how NO is produced in plants is still challenging. It is now generally accepted that the endogenous production of NO is mainly accomplished through the reduction of nitrite via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms which remain to be fully characterized. Furthermore. experimental arguments in favour of the existence of plant nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-like enzymes have been reported. However. recent investigations revealed that land plants do not possess animal NOS-like enzymes while few algal species do.

Despite of this economic prospect. the pathway leading to iridoid biosynthesis from geraniol is still unclear.

In the present study. an extended functional analysis of CYP76 family members was carried-out to identify the most effective enzyme to be used for pathway reconstruction. This disproved CYP76C1 activity and led to the characterization of CYP76C4 from A. thaliana as a geraniol 9- or 8-hydroxylase.

This necessity is heightened by the evolving trend of verifying and validating candidate disease biomarkers in complex biofluids. such as blood plasma. through targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-based approaches with stable isotope-labeled standards (SIS). Considering the lack of performance standards for quantitative plasma proteomics. we previously developed two reference kits to evaluate the MRM with SIS peptide approach using undepleted and non-enriched human plasma.

The oxidative degradation of organic compounds at the ZnO surface results from the ultraviolet (UV) photo-induced creation of highly oxidizing holes and reducing electrons. which combine with surface water to form hydroxyl radicals and reactive oxygen species. Therefore. the efficiency of the electron-hole pair formation is of critical importance for self-cleaning and antimicrobial applications with these metal-oxide catalyst systems. In this study. ZnO thin films were fabricated on sapphire substrates via direct current sputter deposition of Zn-metal films followed by thermal oxidation at several annealing temperatures (300–1200 C). Due to the ease with which they can be recovered. stabilized films are preferable to nanoparticles or colloidal suspensions for some applications. Characterization of the resulting ZnO thin films through atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence indicated that decreasing annealing temperature leads to smaller crystal grain size and increased UV excitonic emission. The photocatalytic activities were characterized by UV-visible absorption measurements of Rhodamine B dye concentrations. The films oxidized at lower annealing temperatures exhibited higher photocatalytic activity. which is attributed to the increased optical quality. Photocatalytic activity was also found to depend on film thickness. with lower activity observed for thinner films. Decreasing activity with use was found to be the result of decreasing film thickness due to surface etching.

Notably about half of the > 45 enzymes (in 17 GH and two GT families) with an identified SBS are from GH13 and a few from GH77. both belonging to clan GH-H of carbohydrate active enzymes. The many enzymes of GH13 with SBSs provide an opportunity to analyse their distribution within this very large and diverse family. SBS containing enzymes in GH13 are spread among 15 subfamilies (two were not assigned a subfamily). Comparison of these SBSs reveals a complex evolutionary history with evidence of conservation of key residues and/or structural location between some SBSs. while others are found at entirely distinct …,True,WZAar4gAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,49,https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s11756-014-0373-9,2294326685891633495,/scholar?cites=2294326685891633495,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maher_Abou_Hachem/publication/262572493_Analysis_of_surface_binding_sites_SBSs_in_carbohydrate_active_enzymes_with_focus_on_glycoside_hydrolase_families_13_and_77_-_a_mini-review/links/53cf53ba0cf2fd75bc59b70f.pdf,0,0,0

Unsaturation with ribose 5-phosphate increased the apparent cooperativity of Pi activation. At unsaturating Pi concentrations partial substrate inhibition by ribose 5-phosphate was observed. Together these results suggest that saturation of the enzyme with Pi directs the subsequent ordered binding of Mg2+ and substrates via a fast pathway. whereas saturation with ribose 5-phosphate leads to the binding of Mg2+ and substrates via a slow pathway where Pibinds to the enzyme last.

However. it remains a great challenge to detect the role of different types of noncovalent interactions between trace solvents and biomolecules such as peptides. In this work. we discover a dominant role of trace amounts of solvents for mediation of dipeptide self-assembly. in which solvent-bridged hydrogen bonding is demonstrated as a crucial force in directing fiber formation. Hydrogen-bond-forming solvents (including ethanol. N.N-dimethylformamide. and acetone) can affect the hydrogen bonding of CO and N–H in diphenylalanine (FF) molecules with themselves. but this does not induce π–π stacking between FF molecules. The directional hydrogen bonding promotes a long-range-ordered arrangement of FF molecules. preferentially along one dimension to form nanofibers or nanobelts.

Altering the dipeptide sequence has a dramatic effect on the properties of the emulsions formed. illustrating the possibility of tuning emulsion properties by chemical design.

Mammals have cytosolic and mitochondrial TRs. which contain an essential selenocysteine residue and reduce cytosolic and mitochondrial thioredoxins. In addition. thioredoxin/glutathione reductase (TGR) was identified. which is a fusion of an N-terminal glutaredoxin domain and the TR module. Here we show that TGR is expressed at low levels in various tissues but accumulates in testes after puberty.

Fifty-six asthmatics and 56 age and sex matched controls were recruited prospectively from an outpatient department. Information on asthma severity and treatment was gathered by a questionnaire. Serum IL-5. total IgE and specific IgE levels were measured in a blinded fashion. There were 32 atopic and 24 non-atopic mild-to-moderate asthmatics. The median serum IL-5 levels in atopic asthmatics (9.5 pg/ml) and in non-atopic asthmatics (8.1 pg/ml) were significantly higher than in normal controls (4.4 pg/ml. both p < 0.003). However. median serum IL-5 levels in atopic and non-atopic asthmatics were not significantly different. The median serum IL-5 level was insignificantly higher in fourteen moderate persistent asthmatics (10.6 pg/ml) compared to forty-two mild persistent asthmatics (7.3 pg/ml) (p = 0.13). The median serum IL-5 levels in asthmatics using regular inhaled steroids (7.8 pg/ml) was not significantly different from those not using inhaled steroids (10.2 pg/ml). Furthermore. serum total IgE levels and eosinophil counts were not significantly different in those using versus those not using inhaled glucocorticoids. Serum IL-5 levels are elevated in mild and moderate persistent atopic and non-atopic asthmatics.

This review focuses on the role of neutrophil as a mediator of myocardial damage. Upon reperfusion. neutrophils accumulate and produce an inflammatory response in the myocardium that is responsible. in part. for the extension of tissue injury associated with reperfusion. It has shown that the inhibition of neutrophil accumulation and adhesion is associated with decreased infarct size. This strongly suggests that myocardial cells at risk region undergo irreversible changes upon reperfusion and accumulation of neutrophils. Several pharmacological agents (ibuprofen. allopurinol. prostacyclin. and prostaglandin E analogues) protect the myocardium from reperfusion injury.

The article proposes that the negative effects of “behavioral momentum” is compounded in such an organization as opposed to a nonhierarchical organization. Behavioral momentum theory suggests that reinforced behavior that persists in organizations is inversely related to the magnitude of disruption and directly related to the reinforcement and sensitivity of resistance to change (Nevin. 2012). The negative effect of behavioral momentum is the inability to adopt innovative ideas and to change. We show that there is an inverse relationship between adoption of innovative ideas and behavioral momentum in organizations.

In severe cases. the trophozoites can breach the mucosal barrier. invade the intestinal epithelium and travel via the portal circulation to the liver. where they cause hepatic abscesses. which can prove fatal if left untreated. The host Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in amoebic invasion by triggering an array of cellular responses in the parasite. including induction of actin rich adhesion structures. Similar actin rich protrusive structures. known as ‘invadosomes’. promote chemotactic migration of the metastatic cancer cells and non-transformed cells by remodeling the ECM. Recent studies showed a central role for Rab GTPases. the master regulators of vesicular trafficking. in biogenesis of invadosomes. Here. we showed that fibronectin. a major host ECM component induced actin remodeling in the parasite in a Rab21 dependent manner. The focalized actin structures formed were reminiscent of the mammalian invadosomes. By using various approaches. such as immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. along with in vitro invasion assay and matrix degradation assay. we show that the fibronectin induced formation of amoebic actin dots depend on the nucleotide status of the GTPase. The ECM components. fibronectin and collagen type I. displayed differential control over the formation of actin dots. with fibronectin positively and collagen type I negatively modulating it.

1037326,FcεR 1-Mediated Mast Cell Reactivity Is Amplified through Prolonged Toll-Like Receptor-Ligand Treatment,2012,Rohit Saluja and Ingrid Delin and Gunnar P Nilsson and Mikael Adner,7,PloS one,8,e43547,Public Library of Science,Background Mast cell-derived mediators mediate several of the pathological features of asthma. Microbial infections induce asthma exacerbations in which the contribution of mast cells remains incomprehensible.   Principal Findings In this study we have investigated the characteristic expression pattern of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1–9 and the effect of TLR ligand treatment on IgE-receptor mediated mast cell reactivity. For the studies we employed in vitro differentiated connective tissue like mast cells (CTLMC) and mucosal like mast cells (MLMC) from mice. Both phenotypes were treated for 24 h or 96 h with ligands for TLR1/2. TLR2/6. TLR3 and TLR4. before activation with IgE and antigen. Prolonged exposure (96 h) with TLR-ligands promoted mast cell reactivity following IgE-receptor activation. TLR4 activation with LPS generated the most pronounced effect. with an enhanced degranulation and secretion of leukotrienes. cytokines and chemokines. in both CTLMC and MLMC. The effect of LPS was mediated through a Myd88-dependent pathway and the increased effect involved JNK-dependent pathway.   Conclusion We find that prolonged exposure of mast cells to pathogens/TLR-ligands modulates their effector responses by priming them for increased release of several inflammatory mediators when subsequently activated by IgE-receptors. These data suggest that infections might exaggerate the severity of allergic reactions such as in asthma. by enhancing mediator release from mast cells.,True,ISm4J-0AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,55,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043547,12870243137003422872,/scholar?cites=12870243137003422872,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043547,0,0,0

In this pathway. the ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) complex promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of NCs remaining stalled in the 60S subunit. NC stalling is recognized by the Rqc2/Tae2 RQC subunit. which also stabilizes binding of the E3 ligase. Listerin/Ltn1. Additionally. Rqc2 modifies stalled NCs with a carboxy-terminal. Ala- and Thr-containing extension—the 'CAT tail'. However. the function of CAT tails and fate of CAT tail-modified ('CATylated') NCs has remained unknown. Here we show that CATylation mediates formation of detergent-insoluble NC aggregates. CATylation and aggregation of NCs could be observed either by inactivating Ltn1 or by analyzing NCs with limited ubiquitylation potential. suggesting that inefficient targeting by Ltn1 favors the Rqc2-mediated reaction.

L-proline has become recognized as an important metabolite for trypanosomatids. It is involved in a number of key processes. including energy metabolism. resistance to oxidative and nutritional stress and osmoregulation. In addition. this amino acid supports critical parasite life cycle processes by acting as an energy source. thus enabling host-cell invasion by the parasite and subsequent parasite differentiation. In this paper. we demonstrate that L-proline is oxidized to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) by the enzyme proline dehydrogenase (TcPRODH. E.C. 1.5.99.8) localized in Trypanosoma cruzi mitochondria. When expressed in its active form in Escherichia coli. TcPRODH exhibits a Km of 16.58±1.69 µM and a Vmax of 66±2 nmol/min mg. Furthermore. we demonstrate that TcPRODH is a FAD-dependent dimeric state protein. TcPRODH mRNA and protein expression are strongly upregulated in the intracellular epimastigote. a stage which requires an external supply of proline. In addition. when Saccharomyces cerevisiae null mutants for this gene (PUT1) were complemented with the TcPRODH gene. diminished free intracellular proline levels and an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress in comparison to the null mutant were observed. supporting the hypothesis that free proline accumulation constitutes a defense against oxidative imbalance. Finally. we show that proline oxidation increases cytochrome c oxidase activity in mitochondrial vesicles.

In S. cerevisiae. chronological lifespan is prolonged by decreasing glucose availability in the culture media. a model for CR. The mechanism has been proposed to involve an increase in the oxidative (versus fermentative) metabolism of glucose. Here. we measured wild-type and respiratory incompetent (ρ0) S. cerevisiae biomass formation. pH. oxygen and glucose consumption. and the evolution of ethanol. glycerol. acetate. pyruvate and succinate levels during the course of 28 days of chronological aging. aiming to identify metabolic changes responsible for the effects of CR. The concomitant and quantitative measurements allowed for calculations of conversion factors between different pairs of substrates and products. maximum specific substrate consumption and product formation rates and maximum specific growth rates. Interestingly. we found that the limitation of glucose availability in CR S. cerevisiae cultures hysteretically increases oxygen consumption rates many hours after the complete exhaustion of glucose from the media. Surprisingly. glucose-to-ethanol conversion and cellular growth supported by glucose were not quantitatively altered by CR. Instead. we found that CR primed the cells for earlier. faster and more efficient metabolism of respiratory substrates. especially ethanol. Since lifespan-enhancing effects of CR are absent in respiratory incompetent ρ0 cells. we propose that the hysteretic effect of glucose limitation on oxidative metabolism is central toward chronological lifespan extension by CR in this yeast.,True,I1oPKuoAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,26,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056388,4125273522384390124,/scholar?cites=4125273522384390124,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056388,0,0,0

Unlike the mouse resistin. expression of the human resistin appears to be regulated differently. We report comparative analyses of the mouse and human genomic fragments encoding the resistin gene. At the amino acid level the two proteins exhibit 59% identity. While at the mRNA level the human resistin shows 64.4% sequence identity with its mouse counterpart. the mouse resistin genomic sequence displays only 46.7% sequence identity with the human resistin and is almost three times bigger than the human resistin.

The experiments. despite their different sensitivities to various aspects of the denaturation process. consistently point to simple. two-state unfolding process. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations with a femtosecond time resolution allow us to unravel the detailed molecular mechanism of Trp-cage unfolding. The process starts with a destabilizing proline shift in the hydrophobic core of the miniprotein. followed by a gradual destruction of the hydrophobic loop and the α-helix.

Here we found that an inhibitor of HDAC. depsipeptide (FR901228). but not trichostatin A (TSA). induces p21Waf1/Cip1 expression through both p53 and Sp1/Sp3 pathways in A549 cells (which retain wild-type p53). This is demonstrated by measuring relative luciferase activities of p21 promoter constructs with p53 or Sp1 binding site mutagenesis and was further confirmed by transfection of wild-type p53 into H1299 cells (p53 null). That p53 was acetylated after depsipeptide treatment was tested by sequential immunoprecipitation/Western immunoblot analysis with anti-acetylated lysines and anti-p53 antibodies. The acetylated p53 has a longer half-life due to a significant decrease in p53 ubiquitination.

SALL3. and GATA4 in human lung cancer cell lines H719 and H23. colon cancer cell line HT-29. and pancreatic cancer cell line PANC1. Although expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was not affected by depsipeptide. a decrease in binding of DNMT1 to the promoter of these genes played a dominant role in depsipeptide-induced demethylation and reactivation. Depsipeptide also suppressed expression of histone methyltransferases G9A and SUV39H1. which in turn resulted in a decrease of di- and trimethylated H3K9 around these …,True,Pp77F0AAAAAJ:43B52WW2E64C,126,https://mcb.asm.org/content/28/10/3219.short,10002606029832609770,/scholar?cites=10002606029832609770,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/28/10/3219.full.pdf,0,0,0

Despite beneficial ERα functions. sustained oestrogenic exposure increases the risk and/or the progression of various cancers. including those of the breast. endometrium and ovary. Oestrogen–ERα interaction can trigger post-translational ERα modifications through crosstalk with signalling pathways to promote transcriptional activation and ubiquitin-mediated ERα proteolysis. with co-activators that have dual roles as ubiquitin ligases. These processes are reviewed herein. The elucidation of mechanisms whereby oestrogen drives both ERα transactivation and receptor proteolysis might have important therapeutic implications not only for breast cancer but also potentially for other hormone-regulated cancers.,True,Pp77F0AAAAAJ:hrkNWuzUpWwC,121,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc3622,8968477257132837822,/scholar?cites=8968477257132837822,,,0,0,0

However. the mechanisms of HDAC inhibitor induced apoptosis are incompletely understood. In this study. depsipeptide. a novel HDAC inhibitor. was shown to be able to induce significant apoptotic cell death in human lung cancer cells. Further study showed that Bim. a BH3-only proapoptotic protein. was significantly upregulated by depsipeptide in cancer cells. and Bim's function in depsipeptide-induced apoptosis was confirmed by knockdown of Bim with RNAi. In addition. we found that depsipeptide-induced expression of Bim was directly dependent on acetylation of forkhead box class O1 (FoxO1) that is catalyzed by cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein. and indirectly induced by a decreased four-and-a-half LIM-domain protein 2.

We identified vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). the primary functional VEGF receptor that mediates endothelial cell vascularization. as a mutant p53 transcriptional target in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Up-regulation of VEGFR2 mediates the role of mutant p53 in increasing cellular growth in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) culture conditions. Mutant p53 binds near the VEGFR2 promoter transcriptional start site and plays a role in maintaining an open conformation at that location. Relatedly. mutant p53 interacts with the SWI/SNF complex. which is required for remodeling the VEGFR2 promoter.

STAT3 induces TWIST1 to drive a p27-dependent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and further activates AKT contributing to acquisition and maintenance of metastatic potential. p27 knockdown in highly metastatic PI3K-activated cells reduces STAT3 binding to the TWIST1 promoter.

This obstacle presents a significant challenge to the nascent development of an RNA world and other models for the origins of life on Earth. Herein. we demonstrate that a scenario based on the formation of a urea/ammonium formate/water (UAFW) eutectic solution leads to an increase in phosphorylation when compared to urea alone for phosphate sources of varying solubility. In addition. under evaporative conditions and in the presence of MgSO4. the UAFW eutectic mobilizes the phosphate sequestered in water‐insoluble hydroxyapatite. giving rise to a marked increase in phosphorylation.

Our purpose was to 1) determine whether its associated hepatotoxicity could be attributable to the induction of a necrotic or apoptotic effect in hepatocytes. and 2) elucidate the mechanism involved. To evaluate cellular responses to azathioprine. we used primary culture of isolated rat hepatocytes. Cell metabolic activity. reduced glutathione. cell proliferation. and lactate dehydrogenase release were assessed. Mitochondria were isolated from rat livers. and swelling and oxygen consumption were measured. Mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and proteins implicated in cell death were analyzed.

More particularly. this invention relates to circuitry and a method for controlling a switched reluctance machine that eliminates the need for a control law table. The circuit and method of the present invention are applicable to all four quadrants of the torque/speed plane of operation. Electric motors turn electrical energy into mechanical energy to produce work. Electric motors work by applying a voltage across one or more windings. thereby energizing the windings to produce a resultant magnetic field. Mechanical forces of attraction caused by the magnetic field cause a rotor in an electric motor to move. The efficiency of the electric motor depends in part on the timing and magnitude of each application of voltage to the motor. Timing of the voltage being applied is particularly important in the case of switched reluctance motors.Historically. the …,True,ao9Xa4kAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,75,http://www.fleadh.co.uk/downloads/EP0736962A2.pdf,9618925683401363038,/scholar?cites=9618925683401363038,,http://www.fleadh.co.uk/downloads/EP0736962A2.pdf,0,0,0

Bacteria within a biofilm are several orders of magnitude more resistant to antibiotics. compared with planktonic bacteria.

These molecules. called autoinducers. are classified as intraspecies (ie.. molecules produced and perceived by the same bacterial species) or interspecies (molecules that are produced and sensed between different bacterial species). AI-2 has been proposed as an interspecies autoinducer and has been shown to regulate different bacterial physiology as well as affect virulence factor production and biofilm formation in some bacteria. including bacteria of clinical relevance. Several groups have embarked on the development of small molecules that could be used to perturb AI-2 signaling in bacteria. with the ultimate goal that these molecules could be used to inhibit bacterial virulence and biofilm formation. Additionally. these molecules have the potential to be used in synthetic biology applications whereby these small molecules are used as inputs to switch on and off AI-2 receptors.

C-di-GMP is synthesized from two molecules of GTP by diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and its actions are terminated by EAL or HD-GYP domain phosphodiesterases (PDEs). which hydrolyze c-di-GMP to linear pGpG or GMP. Thus far the majority of efforts have been dedicated to the development of inhibitors of DGCs but not PDEs. This is probably because the old view was that inhibiting any c-di-GMP PDE would lead to biofilm formation. an undesirable phenotype. Recent data however suggest that some PDEs only change the localized (not global) concentration of c-di-GMP to increase bacterial virulence and do not affect biofilm formation.

The development of a rapid. reliable and economic test is of relevance in order to improve adulterated milk identification. Cyclic voltammetry studies using an Au working electrode were performed on adulterated and non-adulterated milk samples from different independent manufacturers. Voltammetric data and their first derivative were subjected to functional principal component analysis (f-PCA) and correctly classified by the KNN classifier. The adulterated and non-adulterated milk samples showed significant differences. Best results of prediction were obtained with first derivative data. Detection limits in milk samples adulterated with 1% of its total nitrogen derived from melamine or urea were as low as 85.0 mg· L− 1 and 121.4 mg· L− 1. respectively.

After the sedimentary microbial fuel cells were assembled the evolution of current and power vs. time was studied. Two types of commercially available graphite materials were used as electrodes. which differ mainly in shape and size.

Here. we obtain a detailed mechanistic understanding of the forces that dictate the four key steps of chaperone-client interaction: initial binding. complex stabilization. folding. and release. Contrary to the common belief that chaperones recognize unfolding intermediates by their hydrophobic nature. we discover that the model chaperone Spy uses long-range electrostatic interactions to rapidly bind to its unfolded client protein Im7. Short-range hydrophobic interactions follow. which serve to stabilize the complex. Hydrophobic collapse of the client protein then drives its folding. By burying hydrophobic residues in its core. the client’s affinity to Spy decreases. which causes client release. By allowing the client to fold itself.

It has been proposed that proteins utilize disordered regions in the adaptive recognition of their various binding partners. However apart from a few exceptions. defining the importance of disorder in promiscuous binding interactions has proven to be difficult. In this paper. we have utilized a genetic selection that links protein stability to antibiotic resistance to isolate variants of the newly discovered chaperone Spy that show an up to 7 fold improved chaperone activity against a variety of substrates. These “Super Spy” variants show tighter binding to client proteins and are generally more unstable than is wild type Spy and show increases in apparent flexibility. We establish a good relationship between the degree of their instability and the improvement they show in their chaperone activity.

Currently. inhibitors of human epigenetic enzymes are actively investigated as novel anti-cancer drugs and have the potential to be used as new anti-parasitic agents. Here. we report that Schistosoma mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (smHDAC8). the most expressed class I HDAC isotype in this organism. is a functional acetyl-L-lysine deacetylase that plays an important role in parasite infectivity. The crystal structure of smHDAC8 shows that this enzyme adopts a canonical α/β HDAC fold. with specific solvent exposed loops corresponding to insertions in the schistosome HDAC8 sequence. Importantly. structures of smHDAC8 in complex with generic HDAC inhibitors revealed specific structural changes in the smHDAC8 active site that cannot be accommodated by human HDACs. Using a structure-based approach. we identified several small-molecule inhibitors that build on these specificities. These molecules exhibit an inhibitory effect on smHDAC8 but show reduced affinity for human HDACs. Crucially. we show that a newly identified smHDAC8 inhibitor has the capacity to induce apoptosis and mortality in schistosomes.

Here. we identify YL1 as a specific H2A. Z-deposition chaperone. The 2.7-Å-resolution crystal structure of the human YL1–H2A. Z–H2B complex shows that YL1 binding. similarly to ANP32E binding. triggers an extension of the H2A. Z αC helix.

In purple photosynthetic bacteria a simple version of this photoenzyme catalyzes the reduction of a quinone molecule. accompanied by the uptake of two protons from the cytoplasm. This results in the establishment of a proton concentration gradient across the lipid membrane. which can be ultimately harnessed to synthesize ATP.

In this study. 15 PAHs-degrading bacteria were isolated from Egyptian oily soil. Among them. one Gram-negative strain (ASU-06) was selected and biodegradation ability and initial catabolic genes of petroleum compounds were investigated. Comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain ASU-06 to published sequences in GenBank database as well as phylogenetic analysis identified ASU-06 as Sphingomonas koreensis. Strain ASU-06 degraded 100. 99. 98. and 92.7% of 100 mg/L naphthalene. phenanthrene. anthracene. and pyrene within 15 days. respectively. When these PAHs present in a mixed form. the enhancement phenomenon appeared. particularly in the degradation of pyrene. whereas the degradation rate was 98.6% within the period. This is the first report showing the degradation of different PAHs by this species. PCR experiments with specific primers for catabolic genes alkB. alkB1. nahAc. C12O. and C23O suggested that ASU-06 might possess genes for aliphatic and PAHs degradation. while PAH-RHDαGP gene was not detected. Production of biosurfactants and increasing cell-surface hydrophobicity were investigated.

It is a common misunderstanding that closed-form inverse kinematics analysis is solved. Popular software and algorithms. such as gradient descent or any multi-variant equations solving algorithm. claims solving inverse kinematics but only on the numerical level. While the numerical inverse kinematics solutions are relatively straightforward to obtain. these methods often fail. due to dependency on specific numerical values. even when the inverse kinematics solutions exist. Therefore. closed-form inverse kinematics analysis is superior. but there is no generalized automated algorithm. Up till now. the high-level logical reasoning involved in solving closed-form inverse kinematics made it hard to automate. so it's handled by human experts. We developed IKBT. a knowledge-based intelligent system that can mimic human experts' behaviors in solving closed-from inverse kinematics using Behavior Tree. Knowledge and rules used by engineers when solving closed-from inverse kinematics are encoded as actions in Behavior Tree. The order of applying these rules is governed by higher level composite nodes. which resembles the logical reasoning process of engineers. It is also the first time that the dependency of joint variables. an important issue in inverse kinematics analysis. is automatically tracked in graph form. Besides generating closed-form solutions.

It spans the inner membrane twice with a large C‐terminal domain protruding into the periplasmic space. To investigate the importance of the different structural domains for the catalytic activity. we have studied the effects of a large panel of Lep mutants on the processing of signal peptides. both in vivo and in vitro. Our data suggest that the first transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are not directly involved in catalysis. but that the second transmembrane region and the region immediately following it may be in contact with the signal peptide and/or located spatially close to the active site of Lep.,True,J1OqsDsAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,80,https://www.embopress.org/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1460-2075.1990.tb07458.x,8023207115451475918,/scholar?cites=8023207115451475918,,https://www.embopress.org/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1460-2075.1990.tb07458.x,0,0,0
1037632,Mutations in 23 S ribosomal RNA perturb transfer RNA selection and can lead to streptomycin dependence,1994,Nese Bilgin and Måns Ehrenberg,235,Journal of molecular biology,3,813-824,Academic Press,Escherichia coli ribosomes with a G to C transversion at position 2661 in 23 S ribosomal RNA are more accurate in tRNA selection than wild-type ribosomes. This enhanced accuracy is due to improved initial selection of ternary complexes rather than proofreading of aminoacyl-tRNAs. The 2661C mutation reduces the binding rate of cognate ternary complexes to the A-site. This binding rate deficiency becomes dramatic when ribosomes also harbour an S12 mutation with a streptomycin-resistant. hyperaccurate phenotype. In this case. severe loss of kinetic efficiency in EF-Tu function leads to cell death. Streptomycin restores viability by increasing the association rate of ternary complex to these doubly altered ribosomes. The binding rate of EF-G to 2661C ribosomes is also reduced while the translocation rate is unaffected.,True,J1OqsDsAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,58,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283684710412,11191303034622044143,/scholar?cites=11191303034622044143,,,0,0,0

Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD). enables synchronous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker discovery and genotyping using massively parallel sequencing. The objective of this research was to assess the utility of RAD markers for linkage map construction. employing barley as a model system. Using the published high density EST-based SNP map in the Oregon Wolfe Barley (OWB) mapping population as a reference. we created a RAD map using a limited set of prior markers to establish linakge group identity. integrated the RAD and prior data. and used both maps for detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL). Using the RAD protocol in tandem with the Illumina sequence by synthesis platform. a total of 530 SNP markers were identified from initial scans of the OWB parental inbred lines - the ""dominant"" and ""recessive"" marker stocks - and scored in a 93 member doubled haploid (DH) mapping population.

Fagaceae) have failed to resolve the backbone topology of the genus with strong support. Here. we utilize next-generation sequencing of restriction-site associated DNA (RAD-Seq) to resolve a framework phylogeny of a predominantly American clade of oaks whose crown age is estimated at 23–33 million years old. Using a recently developed analytical pipeline for RAD-Seq phylogenetics. we created a concatenated matrix of 1.40 E06 aligned nucleotides. constituting 27.727 sequence clusters. RAD-Seq data were readily combined across runs. with no difference in phylogenetic placement between technical replicates. which overlapped by only 43–64% in locus coverage. 17% (4.715) of the loci we analyzed could be mapped with high confidence to one or more expressed sequence tags in NCBI Genbank. A concatenated matrix of the loci that BLAST to at least one EST sequence provides approximately half as many variable or parsimony-informative characters as equal-sized datasets from the non-EST loci. The EST-associated matrix is more complete (fewer missing loci) and has slightly lower homoplasy than non-EST subsampled matrices of the same size. but there is no difference in phylogenetic support or relative attribution of base substitutions to internal versus terminal branches of the phylogeny.

In wild-type. chitin synthase II is required for the formation of primary septa and chitin synthase III (CSIII) is not essential. However. in chs2 mutants CSIII becomes essential for the formation of aberrant septa.

The heat-threshold level varies considerably at different developmental stages. With a view to survive under heat stress. mechanisms of regulation at the molecular level enable plants to prosper. Traditional breeding contributed for improving heat tolerance meagrely. The genetic transformation approach needs to be accelerated that can mitigate harmful effects by developing improved thermotolerance of crop plants. In this background. a thorough understanding of physiological responses of plants to high temperature. mechanisms of heat tolerance and possible strategies is vital. Temperature changes are sensed through cellular responses due to signal transduction into the cell.

Using mutations of the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway. we found that DsbAss directs thioredoxin 1 to the SRP export pathway. When DsbAss is fused to MBP. MBP also is directed to the SRP pathway. We show directly that the DsbAss-promoted export of MBP is largely cotranslational. in contrast to the mode of MBP export when the native signal sequence is utilized. However. both the export of thioredoxin 1 by DsbAss and the export of DsbA itself are quite sensitive to even the slight inhibition of SecA.

However. two commonly used signal sequences. those of PhoA and MalE. which promote export by a posttranslational mechanism. do not export thioredoxin. We proposed that this difference in efficiency of export was due to the rapid folding of thioredoxin in the cytoplasm; cotranslational export by the DsbA signal sequence avoids the problem of cytoplasmic folding (C.

Thus. it has generally been assumed that the translocation machinery also recognizes its protein substrates posttranslationally. Here we report a specific interaction between SecA and the ribosome at a site near the polypeptide exit channel. This interaction is mediated by conserved motifs in SecA and ribosomal protein L23. and partial disruption of this interaction in vivo by introducing mutations into the genes encoding SecA or L23 affects the efficiency of translocation by the posttranslational pathway.

Bacteria have therefore evolved powerful quality control networks consisting of chaperones and proteases that cooperate to monitor the folding states of proteins and to remove misfolded conformers through either refolding or degradation. The levels of the quality control components are adjusted to the folding state of the cellular proteome through the induction of compartment specific stress responses. In addition. the activities of several quality control components are directly controlled by these stresses. allowing for fast activation.

A subset of this family. including Pet. the prototypical member of the Enterobacteriaceae serine proteases. possess unusual signal peptides which can be divided into five regions termed N1 (charged). H1 (hydrophobic). N2. H2 and C (cleavage site) domains. The N1 and H1 regions. which the authors have named the extended signal peptide region (ESPR). demonstrate remarkable conservation. In contrast. the N2. H2 and C regions show significant variability. and are reminiscent of typical Sec-dependent signal sequences.

However. thioredoxin can be translocated to the periplasm when it is attached to a cotranslational signal sequence. When exported to the periplasm. it can partially replace the activity of DsbA in promoting the formation of disulfide bonds. In contrast. when thioredoxin is fused to a posttranslational signal sequence. very little of it appears in the periplasm. We propose that this absence of posttranslational export is due to the rapid folding of thioredoxin in the cytoplasm. We sought mutants of thioredoxin that retarded its folding in the cytoplasm. which we accomplished by fusing thioredoxin to a posttranslational signal sequence and selecting for mutants in which thioredoxin was exported to the periplasm. where it could replace DsbA.

Recent work from our laboratory indicates that SecA binds to ribosomes. Here. we used two different approaches to demonstrate that SecA also interacts with nascent polypeptides in vivo and that these polypeptides are Sec substrates. First. we photo-cross-linked SecA to ribosomes in vivo and identified mRNAs that copurify with SecA. Microarray analysis of the copurifying mRNAs indicated a strong enrichment for proteins containing Sec-targeting sequences. Second. we used a 2-dimensional (2-D) gel approach to analyze radioactively labeled nascent polypeptides that copurify with SecA. including maltose binding protein. a well-characterized SecA substrate.

At its core. this machinery consists of SecA and the integral membrane proteins SecYEG. which form a protein conducting channel in the membrane. Proteins are recognised by the Sec machinery by virtue of an internally encoded targeting signal. which usually takes the form of an N-terminal signal sequence. In addition. substrate proteins must be maintained in an unfolded conformation in the cytoplasm. prior to translocation. in order to be competent for translocation through SecYEG. Recognition of substrate proteins occurs via SecA—either through direct recognition by SecA or through secondary recognition by a molecular chaperone that delivers proteins to SecA.

TNF-α secretion is regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Post-transcriptional regulation occurs by modulation of TNF-α mRNA stability via the binding of tristetraprolin (TTP) to the adenosine/uridine-rich elements found in the 3′-untranslated region of the TNF-α transcript. Phosphorylation plays important roles in modulating mRNA stability. because activation of p38 MAPK by lipopolysaccharide stabilizes TNF-α mRNA. We hypothesized that the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) regulates this signaling pathway. Our results show that inhibition of PP2A by okadaic acid or small interference RNA significantly enhanced the stability of TNF-α mRNA.

Widespread use of chemical pesticides represents a potential risk to human and the environment. Therefore. the search for alternative strategies in pest control is timely to overcome this problem. Desirable are preparations that exhibit new modes of actions and impair processes that are rather specific to the pest in order to be combated. In the last twenty five years. much attention has been devoted to natural pest control agents. One of the most important groups among them are plant based active substances or mixtures of substances commonly known as ‘botanicals’. Such natural products typically occur as cocktails of metabolically related compounds with differing activity/spectrum towards different insects.

Resveratrol is thought to be responsible for the “French Paradox” which associates red wine consumption to the low incidence of cardiovascular diseases. The interest in resveratrol has increased due to its pharmacological effects that include cardio and neuroprotection and several other benefic actions (e.g. antioxidant. anti-inflammatory. anti-carcinogenic and anti-aging). Despite the therapeutic effects of resveratrol. its pharmacokinetic properties are not favorable since this compound has poor bioavailability being rapidly and extensively metabolized and excreted. To overcome this problem. drug delivery systems have been developed to protect and stabilize resveratrol and to enhance its bioavailability.

Various natural compounds have been suggested as therapeutics for AD. Among these compounds. resveratrol has aroused great interest due to its neuroprotective characteristics. Here. we provide evidence that grape skin and grape seed extracts increase the inhibition effect on Aβ aggregation. However. after intravenous injection. resveratrol is rapidly metabolized into both glucuronic acid and sulfate conjugations of the phenolic groups in the liver and intestinal epithelial cells (within less than 2 h). which are then eliminated. In the present study. we show that solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) functionalized with an antibody. the anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (OX26 mAb). can work as a possible carrier to transport the extract to target the brain. Experiments on human brain-like endothelial cells show that the cellular uptake of the OX26 SLNs is substantially more efficient than that of normal SLNs and SLNs functionalized with an unspecific antibody. As a consequence. the transcytosis ability of these different SLNs is higher when functionalized with OX-26.

SLNs and NLCs presented a mean diameter between 160 and 190 nm. high negative zeta potential of− 30 mV and resveratrol entrapment efficiency of 80%. suggesting they are suitable for resveratrol oral delivery. Nanoencapsulation effectively protected resveratrol from photodegradation. and MTT assays demonstrated that neither resveratrol nor lipid nanoparticles adversely affected cell viability and integrity of Caco-2 cell monolayers. The in vitro intestinal permeability of resveratrol was significantly increased by NLCs. and SLNs did not impair the absorption of resveratrol. Resveratrol oral absorption can be enhanced during meals. since the intestinal permeability was increased in the presence of fed-state intestinal juices.

The 20S core complex consists of four stacked rings of seven α or β subunits. Three β subunits contain a catalytic site and can be replaced by three interferon γ‐inducible counterparts to form the immunoproteasome. Cells may constitutively possess a mixture of both 20S proteasome types leading to a heterogeneous proteasome population. Purified rat 20S proteasome has been separated in several chromatographic fractions indicating an even higher degree of complexity in 20S proteasome subunit composition.

BDNF is expressed by skeletal muscles in an activity-dependent manner. In this study. BDNF mRNA was analysed by RT-PCR in the soleus muscle following a single (acute) session of running or a training of five days of running (repetitive exercise). Moreover. the expression of the exons was quantitatively analysed by real time RT-PCR. Finally. muscle BDNF protein level was evaluated by western blotting. BDNF mRNA was found to increase over the second day after acute exercise; on the other hand. two peaks (2 and 24 hours after the last session. respectively) in BDNF mRNA level were found after repetitive exercise. but it was similar to that of controls 6 hours after the last session. BDNF protein level progressively increased also after the mRNA went back to the basal level. so suggesting that it cumulates within the cell after acute exercise. whereas it followed the mRNA level time course after repetitive exercise. These results point to the following conclusions: BDNF mRNA is up-regulated by activity. but this response is delayed to the second day after acute exercise; repetitive exercise transiently depresses the expression of BDNF mRNA. so that the over-expression due to the previous day's exercise completely disappears 6 hours after the last exercise session.,True,fxOU79QAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,63,http://architalbiol.org/index.php/aib/article/view/14599,12856534811360452890,/scholar?cites=12856534811360452890,,http://architalbiol.org/index.php/aib/article/viewFile/14599/781,0,0,0

Sarcopenia and osteoporosis often coexist in elderly people. with a prevalence of the latter in elderly women. The profound interaction between muscle and bone induces a negative resonance between the two tissues affected by these disorders worsening the quality of life in the postmenopausal period. It has been estimated that at least 1 in 3 women over age 50 will experience osteoporotic fractures. often requiring hospitalisation and long-term care. causing a large financial burden to health insurance systems.

This study describes the flavonoid content. the photosynthetic pigment composition and the proline. tocopherol and ascorbate content in UV-B exposed maize plants. Following exposure. the tocopherol content was slightly. but significantly lower. pointing to the membrane environment as a primary target for UV-B radiation. The water-soluble antioxidant content was largely unaffected. but an enhanced turnover in the ascorbate–glutathione cycle might be needed for tocopherol regeneration.,True,HX-s9LUAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,112,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098847203000200,7782463846206188128,/scholar?cites=7782463846206188128,,,0,0,0

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) was supplied with 0–50 μM selenate and analyzed for elemental composition and antioxidant compounds. When supplied at low doses (5 and 10 μM) via the roots. Se stimulated the synthesis of phenolic compounds in leaves and reduced the levels of Mo. Fe. Mn. and Cu in roots. At higher doses (25 and 50 μM Se) leaf glutathione levels were 3–5-fold enhanced. Supply of selenate via foliar spray (0. 2. or 20 mg Se plant–1) resulted in Se-biofortified tomato fruits. with Se levels low enough not to pose a health risk. The Se-biofortified fruits showed enhanced levels of the antioxidant flavonoids naringenin chalcone and kaempferol and a concomitant decrease of cinnamic acid derivatives.

Using mutant mouse models that lack c-Rel. the critical NF-κB transcription factor required for nTreg differentiation. we establish that c-Rel regulates both of these developmental steps. c-Rel controls the generation of nTreg precursors via a haplo-insufficient mechanism. indicating that this step is highly sensitive to c-Rel levels.

While the subsequent IL-2 induction of Foxp3 in nTreg precursors requires c-Rel. this developmental transition does not coincide with the nuclear expression of c-Rel.

Compounds including pharmaceutical drugs that are basic and lipophilic will become sequestered inside lysosomes (lysosomotropic). How cells respond to the lysosomal stress associated with lysosomotropism is not well characterized. Our goal is to assess the lysosomal changes and identify the signaling pathways that involve in the lysosomal changes. Eight chemically diverse lysosomotropic drugs from different therapeutic areas were subjected to the evaluation using the human adult retinal pigmented epithelium cell line. ARPE-19. All lysosomotropic drugs tested triggered lysosomal activation demonstrated by increased lysosotracker red (LTR) and lysosensor green staining. increased cathepsin activity. and increased LAMP2 staining. However. tested lysosomotropic drugs also prompted lysosomal dysfunction exemplified by intracellular and extracellular substrate accumulation including phospholipid. SQSTM1/p62.

Previous studies in cell and mouse model systems have demonstrated that these proteins play roles in the metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). including processes involved in the generation. catabolism and deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides.  Methodology/Principal Findings Mice transgenic for mutant APPswe and mutant presenilin 1 (PS1dE9) were mated to mice with homozygous deletion of RAP. Unexpectedly. mice that were homozygous null for RAP and transgenic for APPswe/PS1dE9 showed high post-natal mortality. necessitating a shift in focus to examine the levels of amyloid deposition in APPswe/PS1dE9 that were hemizygous null for RAP. Immunoblot analysis confirmed 50% reductions in the levels of RAP with modest reductions in the levels of proteins dependent upon RAP for maturation [LRP trend towards a 20% reduction ; SorLA/LR11 statistically significant 15% reduction (p<0.05)]. Changes in the levels of these proteins in the brains of [APPswe/PS1dE9](+/−)/RAP(+/−) mice correlated with 30–40% increases in amyloid deposition by 9 months of age.

Constitutive overproduction of DnaK from a multicopy plasmid containing large chromosomal fragments spanning the dnaK region resulted in plasmid instability. Co-overproduction of DnaJ with DnaK stabilized plasmid levels. To examine the effects of altered levels of DnaK and DnaJ in a more specific manner. an inducible expression system for dnaK and dnaJ was constructed and characterized. Differential rates of DnaK synthesis were determined by quantitative Western blot (immunoblot) analysis.

Binding to the protein is accompanied by a relatively large increase in fluorescent intensity. To correlate the major change in optical properties and to determine the mechanism of competitive inhibition with fatty acids. the crystal structure of the protein with the bound fluorophore has been determined. In addition. the thermodynamic contributions to the binding reaction have been studied by titration calorimetry. Because the binding site is in a relatively internal position. kinetic studies have also been carried out to determine kon. The results indicate that binding is not accompanied by any major conformational change. However. the negatively charged sulfonate moiety is not positioned the same as the carboxylate of fatty acid ligands as determined …,True,RBkzWd0AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,69,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349599769614,2282948042778697338,/scholar?cites=2282948042778697338,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349599769614,0,0,0

This study had two aims: i) to validate htY2H as a source of protein-protein interaction complexes for high-throughput biochemical and structural studies of the H. pylori interactome; and ii) to validate biochemically interactions shown by htY2H to involve components of the H. pylori type IV secretion systems. Thus. 17 interactions involving 31 proteins and protein fragments were studied. and a general strategy was designed to produce protein-interacting partners for biochemical and structural characterization.

Ltd.,Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for serious meningitis. Although many useful molecular tools have been developed for its study. there are currently few inducible promoters available for general use. To address this need. we have constructed expression plasmids incorporating upstream elements of the C. neoformans copper transporter gene CTR4. and tested them in C. neoformans serotypes A and D. In response to copper deprivation. these plasmids mediate high‐level expression of a reporter protein. This expression can be completely repressed using physiologically low concentrations of copper. Notably. this new family of copper‐sensing promoters demonstrates excellent expression in serotype A. contrasting with other available promoters.

Prevalence of disease between males and females is skewed. with males having an increased incidence of disease. Based on the reported gender susceptibility differences to Cn in the literature. we used clinical isolates from Botswanan HIV-infected patients to test the hypothesis that different gender environments exerted different selective pressures on Cn. When we examined this data set. we found that men had significantly higher risk of death despite having significantly higher CD4+ T lymphocyte counts upon admittance to the hospital. These observations suggested that Cn strains are uniquely adapted to different host gender environments and that the male immune response may be less efficient in controlling Cn infection. To discriminate between these possibilities. we tested whether there were phenotypic differences between strains isolated from males and females and whether there was an interaction between Cn and the host immune response. Virulence phenotypes showed that Cn isolates from females had longer doubling times and released more capsular glucoronoxylomannan (GXM). The presence of testosterone but not 17-β estradiol was associated with higher levels of GXM release for a laboratory strain and 28 clinical isolates. We also measured phagocytic efficiency. survival of Cn. and amount of killing of human macrophages by Cn after incubation with four isolates.

All existing evidence points to the binding cavity and a poorly delimited ‘portal’ region as defining the function of each family member. The importance of local structure within the cavity appears to be its influence on binding affinity and specificity for the lipid. The portal region appears to be involved in the regulation of ligand exchange. Within the iLBP family. liver fatty acid binding protein or LFABP. has the unique property of binding two fatty acids within its internalized binding cavity rather than the commonly observed stoichiometry of one. Furthermore. LFABP will bind hydrophobic molecules larger than the ligands which will associate with other iLBPs.

These cellular recognition events are initiated by an exquisitely specific adhesion of free-swimming spermatozoa to the zona pellucida. an acellular matrix that surrounds the ovulated oocyte. Decades of research focusing on this interaction have led to the establishment of a widely held paradigm that the zona pellucida receptor is a single molecular entity that is constitutively expressed on the sperm cell surface. In contrast. we have employed the techniques of blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. far Western blotting. and proximity ligation to secure the first direct evidence in support of a novel hypothesis that zona binding is mediated by multimeric sperm receptor complex(es).

While traditionally viewed as a simple lock and key mechanism. emerging evidence suggests that this event may require the concerted action of several sperm proteins. In this study we examine the hypothesis that the activity of such proteins may be coordinated by their assembly into multimeric recognition complexes on the sperm surface. Through the novel application of blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). we tender the first direct evidence that human spermatozoa do indeed express a number of high molecular weight protein complexes on their surface.

The gametes that emerge from the testes are. however. functionally immature and only acquire full functionality once they have completed a process of post-testicular maturation in the epididymis and female reproductive tract. Remarkably. this acquisition of sperm function occurs while these cells are transcriptionally and translationally silent and is therefore highly dependent on post-translational modifications to their existing protein complement.

1037893,Characteristics of the epididymal luminal environment responsible for sperm maturation and storage,2018,Wei Zhou and Geoffry N De Iuliis and Matthew D Dun and Brett Nixon,9,,,59,Frontiers,The testicular spermatozoa of all mammalian species are considered functionally immature owing to their inability to swim in a progressive manner and engage in productive interactions with the cumulus oocyte complex. The ability to express these key functional attributes develops progressively during the cells’ descent through the epididymis. a highly specialized ductal system that forms an integral part of the male reproductive tract. The functional maturation of the spermatozoon is achieved via continuous interactions with the epididymal luminal microenvironment and remarkably. occurs in the complete absence of de novo gene transcription or protein translation. Compositional analysis of the luminal fluids collected from the epididymis of a variety of species has revealed the complexity of this milieu. with a diversity of inorganic ions. proteins. and small non-coding RNA transcripts having been identified to date. Notably. both the quantitative and qualitative profile each of these different luminal elements display substantial segment-to-segment variation which in turn contribute to the regionalized functionality of this long tubule. Thus. spermatozoa acquire functional maturity in the proximal segments before being stored in a quiescent state in the distal segment in preparation for ejaculation. Such marked division of labor is achieved via the combined secretory and absorptive activity of the epithelial cells lining each segment. Here. we review our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that exert influence over the unique intraluminal environment of the epididymis. with a particular focus on vesicle-dependent mechanisms that facilitate …,True,Wxc-IHYAAAAJ:TGkaJS32XoUC,56,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00059/full,8412254670931807646,/scholar?cites=8412254670931807646,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2018.00059/full,0,0,0

Although this unique cellular interaction can now be readily by-passed by assisted reproductive strategies such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). recent large-scale epidemiological studies have encouraged the cautious use of this technology and highlighted the need for further research into the mechanisms responsible for defective sperm-egg recognition. Previous work in this field has established that the sperm domains responsible for oocyte interaction are formed during spermatogenesis prior to being dynamically modified during epididymal maturation and capacitation in female reproductive tract.

Dormant cells of MTB with coccoid morphology were produced in some in vivo studies. but similar forms were not produced in the known in vitro models in sufficient amounts to permit their characterization. This work demonstrates the efficient formation of phase-dark ovoid cells in MTB cultures within 150 days after the onset of stationary phase. During this time the medium underwent gradual acidification (pH 8.5 → 4.7) as a result of cellular metabolism. A rapid change in the external pH resulted in cell degradation and death. In common with the dormant forms found in other organisms. the ovoid cells had thickened cell walls. a low metabolic activity and elevated resistance to antibiotics and heating.

Although TB latency has been known for many years it remains poorly understood. In particular. substances of host origin. which may induce the resuscitation of dormant mycobacteria. have not yet been described. In vitro models of dormant (“non-culturable”) cells of Mycobacterium smegmatis (mc2155) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv were used. We found that the resuscitation of dormant M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis cells in liquid medium was stimulated by adding free unsaturated fatty acids (FA). including arachidonic acid. at concentrations of 1.6–10 µM. FA addition enhanced cAMP levels in reactivating M. smegmatis cells and exogenously added cAMP (3–10 mM) or dibutyryl-cAMP (0.5–1 mM) substituted for FA. causing resuscitation of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis dormant cells. A M. smegmatis null-mutant lacking MSMEG_4279. which encodes a FA-activated adenylyl cyclase (AC). could not be resuscitated by FA but it was resuscitated by cAMP. M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis cells hyper-expressing AC were unable to form non-culturable cells and a specific inhibitor of AC (8-bromo-cAMP) prevented FA-dependent resuscitation. RT-PCR analysis revealed that rpfA (coding for resuscitation promoting factor A) is up-regulated in M. smegmatis in the beginning of exponential growth following the cAMP increase in lag phase caused by FA-induced cell activation. A specific Rpf inhibitor (4-benzoyl-2-nitrophenylthiocyanate) suppressed FA-induced resuscitation.

A cornerstone of the cellular osmotic stress response is the metabolic supply of energy and building blocks to mount appropriate defenses. Yet. the extent to which osmotic stress impinges on the metabolic network remains largely unknown. Moreover. it is mostly unclear which. if any. of the metabolic responses to osmotic stress are conserved among diverse organisms or confined to particular groups of species. Here we investigate the global metabolic responses of twelve bacteria. two yeasts and two human cell lines exposed to sustained hyperosmotic salt stress by measuring semiquantitative levels of hundreds of cellular metabolites using nontargeted metabolomics. Beyond the accumulation of osmoprotectants. we observed significant changes of numerous metabolites in all species. Global metabolic responses were predominantly species-specific. yet individual metabolites were characteristically affected depending on species’ taxonomy. natural habitat. envelope structure or salt tolerance. Exploiting the breadth of our dataset. the correlation of individual metabolite response magnitudes across all species implicated lower glycolysis. tricarboxylic acid cycle. branched-chain amino acid metabolism and heme biosynthesis to be generally important for salt tolerance.

Despite over a century of research on this topic. the enzymatic basis of this perceptual switch remains unknown. Here. we show that a cytochrome P450 family member.

We investigated the behavior of knotted protein molecules as they are first synthesized by the ribosome using a cell-free translation system. We found that newly translated knotted proteins can spontaneously self-tie and do not require the assistance of molecular chaperones to fold correctly to their trefoil-knotted structures. This process is slow but efficient. and we found no evidence of misfolded species. A kinetic analysis indicates that the knotting process is rate limiting. occurs post-translationally. and is specifically and significantly (P< 0.001) accelerated by the GroEL–GroES chaperonin complex.

How or why these topological knots arise remains unclear. By developing a method to experimentally trap and detect knots in nonnative polypeptide chains. we find that two knotted methyltransferases. YibK and YbeA. can exist in a trefoil-knot conformation even in their chemically unfolded states. The unique denatured-state topology of these molecules explains their ability to efficiently fold to their native knotted structures in vitro and offers insights into the potential role of knots in proteins. Furthermore. the high prevalence of the denatured-state knots identified here suggests that they are either difficult to untie or that threading of any untied molecules is rapid and spontaneous.

They contain a conserved ‘helicase core’of two RecA-like domains (domains (D) 1 and D2). which uses ATP to catalyse the unwinding of short RNA duplexes by non-processive. local strand separation 3. This mode of action differs from that of translocating helicases and allows DEAD-box proteins to remodel large RNAs and RNA–protein complexes without globally disrupting RNA structure 4. However. the structural basis for this distinctive mode of RNA unwinding remains unclear. Here. structural. biochemical and genetic analyses of the yeast DEAD-box protein Mss116p indicate that the helicase core domains have modular functions that enable a novel mechanism for RNA-duplex recognition and unwinding.

Although this topological complexity does not appear to cause a folding problem. the mechanisms by which such knotted proteins form are unknown. We found that the fusion of an additional protein domain to either the amino terminus. the carboxy terminus. or to both termini of two small knotted proteins did not affect their ability to knot. The multidomain constructs remained able to fold to structures previously thought unfeasible. some representing the deepest protein knots known.

1037990,Mastering the canonical loop of serine protease inhibitors: enhancing potency by optimising the internal hydrogen bond network,2011,Joakim E Swedberg and Simon J De Veer and Kei C Sit and Cyril F Reboul and Ashley M Buckle and Jonathan M Harris,6,PloS one,4,e19302,Public Library of Science,Background Canonical serine protease inhibitors commonly bind to their targets through a rigid loop stabilised by an internal hydrogen bond network and disulfide bond(s). The smallest of these is sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI-1). a potent and broad-range protease inhibitor. Recently. we re-engineered the contact β-sheet of SFTI-1 to produce a selective inhibitor of kallikrein-related peptidase 4 (KLK4). a protease associated with prostate cancer progression. However. modifications in the binding loop to achieve specificity may compromise structural rigidity and prevent re-engineered inhibitors from reaching optimal binding affinity.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. the effect of amino acid substitutions on the internal hydrogen bonding network of SFTI were investigated using an in silico screen of inhibitor variants in complex with KLK4 or trypsin. Substitutions favouring internal hydrogen bond formation directly correlated with increased potency of inhibition in vitro. This produced a second generation inhibitor (SFTI-FCQR Asn14) which displayed both a 125-fold increased capacity to inhibit KLK4 (Ki = 0.0386±0.0060 nM) and enhanced selectivity over off-target serine proteases. Further. SFTI-FCQR Asn14 was stable in cell culture and bioavailable in mice when administered by intraperitoneal perfusion.

To determine the role of KLK4 in these events. we examined KLK4-transfected SKOV-3 and endogenous KLK4 expressing OVCA432 cells in 3-dimensional (3D) suspension culture to mimic the ascites microenvironment. KLK4-SKOV-3 cells formed multicellular aggregates (MCAs) as seen in ascites. as did SKOV-3 cells treated with active KLK4. MCA formation was reduced by treatment with a KLK4 blocking antibody or the selective active site KLK4 sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI-FCQR). KLK4-MCAs formed larger cancer cell foci in mesothelial cell monolayers than those formed by vector and native SKOV-3 cells. suggesting KLK4-MCAs are highly invasive in the peritoneal microenvironment. A high level of KLK4 is expressed by ascitic EOC cells compared to matched primary tumor cells. further supporting its role in the ascitic microenvironment. Interestingly. KLK4 transfected SKOV-3 cells expressed high levels of the KLK4 substrate. urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). particularly in 3D-suspension. and high levels of both KLK4 and uPA were observed in patient cells taken from ascites.

The synthesis used an anodic amide oxidation to selectively functionalize the C5-position of a 3-phenylproline derivative. The resulting proline derivative was coupled to a Cbz-protected phenylalanine. and an intramolecular reductive amination strategy used to convert the coupled material into a bicyclic piperazinone ring skeleton. The net result was a dipeptide building block that imbedded one of two proposed receptor bound conformations for the Phe7-Phe8 region of substance P into a bicyclic ring skeleton. The building block was then converted into a constrained substance P analogue with the use of solid-phase peptide synthesis.

Dordrecht,Altered gene expression resulting from changes in the post-translational modification patterns of the histones and DNA is collectively termed epigenetics. Such changes are inherited albeit there are no alterations in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is implemented by a wide repertoire of histone and DNA modifying enzymes including the acetyltransferases and deacetylases. the methyltransferases and kinases among others. Therefore. a regulation of these enzyme activities affords a tighter regulation of gene expression. Conversely. aberrant enzymatic activities lead to unregulated gene expression. resulting in several diseases such as RTS (loss of CBP HAT activity) and Spinal and Bulbar muscular atrophy (HATs and HMTases). apart from several forms of cancers. particularly myeloid leukemia (RAR-PML or RAR-PLZF fusion proteins resulting in the mistargeting of HDACs).

1038020,Complexity of dopamine metabolism,2013,Johannes Meiser and Daniel Weindl and Karsten Hiller,11,,1,1-18,BioMed Central,Parkinson’s disease (PD) coincides with a dramatic loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. A key player in the loss of dopaminergic neurons is oxidative stress. Dopamine (DA) metabolism itself is strongly linked to oxidative stress as its degradation generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DA oxidation can lead to endogenous neurotoxins whereas some DA derivatives show antioxidative effects. Therefore. DA metabolism is of special importance for neuronal redox-homeostasis and viability. In this review we highlight different aspects of dopamine metabolism in the context of PD and neurodegeneration. Since most reviews focus only on single aspects of the DA system. we will give a broader overview by looking at DA biosynthesis. sequestration. degradation and oxidation chemistry at the metabolic level. as well as at the transcriptional. translational and posttranslational regulation of all …,True,1Kt1jDkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,420,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1478-811X-11-34,12503173525139705139,/scholar?cites=12503173525139705139,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1478-811X-11-34,0,0,0

LPS-activated macrophages undergo profound metabolic changes to adapt to these new physiological requirements. One key step to mediate this metabolic adaptation is the stabilization of HIF1α. which leads to increased glycolysis and lactate release. as well as decreased oxygen consumption. HIF1 abundance can result in the induction of the gene encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) via phosphorylation. Therefore. it has been speculated that pyruvate oxidation through PDH is decreased in pro-inflammatory macrophages.

1038039,Spatial control of Draper receptor signaling initiates apoptotic cell engulfment,2018,Adam P Williamson and Ronald D Vale,217,Journal of Cell Biology,11,3977-3992,Rockefeller University Press,The engulfment of apoptotic cells is essential for tissue homeostasis and recovering from damage. Engulfment is mediated by receptors that recognize ligands exposed on apoptotic cells such as phosphatidylserine (PS). In this study. we convert Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells into proficient phagocytes by transfecting the Draper engulfment receptor and replacing apoptotic cells with PS-coated beads. Similar to the T cell receptor (TCR). PS-ligated Draper forms dynamic microclusters that recruit cytosolic effector proteins and exclude a bulky transmembrane phosphatase. consistent with a kinetic segregation-based triggering mechanism. However. in contrast with the TCR. localized signaling at Draper microclusters results in time-dependent depletion of actin filaments. which facilitates engulfment.

1038040,Mechanisms of Ubiquitin-Driven Cell Cycle Control,2012,Adam Williamson,,,,,,Posttranslational modification of proteins with ubiquitin. ubiquitylation. is essential in all eukaryotes. Ubiquitylation is accomplished by an enzymatic cascade: E1 activates ubiquitin and transfers it to E2. which works with E3 to transfer ubiquitin to substrate residues. usually lysines. Once attachment of the first ubiquitins to substrate. chain initiation. has occurred. E2 and E3 modify one of the seven lysine residues in ubiquitin itself. resulting in formation of polymeric ubiquitin chains. chain elongation. Ubiquitylation is involved in nearly every cellular process. and is central to cell cycle control. Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation is especially important during mitosis. as cells must turn over many proteins within a short time-window. The anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) is an essential E3 that targets cell cycle regulators for degradation during mitosis. The APC/C must degrade many substrates within a short period of time. and likely acts under saturation. Furthermore. APC/C substrates are required at different times during mitosis. Therefore. the APC/C cannot degrade all substrate at once. but rather must order substrate degradation so that substrate proteins can accomplish their functions. The balance between efficiency and regulated degradation is the APC/C's major challenge as it orchestrates mitotic exit. In this dissertation I address how human APC/C targets its many substrates for degradation. First. I report our finding that APC/C functions by decorating its substrates with Lys11-linked ubiquitin chains. Lys11-linked chains target substrates to the 26S proteasome and are essential for cell division in human cells.

Two main antioxidant systems exist. The nonenzymatic system relies on molecules to directly quench ROS and the enzymatic system is composed of specific enzymes that detoxify ROS. Among the latter. the superoxide dismutase (SOD) family is important in oxidative stress modulation. Of these. manganese-dependent SOD (MnSOD) plays a major role due to its mitochondrial location. ie. the main site of superoxide (O 2•−) production. As such. extensive research has focused on its capacity to modulate oxidative stress. Early data demonstrated the relevance of MnSOD as an O 2•− scavenger. More recent research has. however. identified a prominent role for MnSOD in carcinogenesis. In addition. SOD downregulation appears associated with health risk in heart and brain.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the aerobic training on oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defense in liver mitochondria both after training and in response to three repeated exhaustive swimming bouts.   Methods Wistar rats were divided into training (n = 14) and control (n = 14) groups. Training group performed a 6-week swimming training protocol. Subsets of training (n = 7) and control (n = 7) rats performed 3 repeated exhaustive swimming bouts with 72 h rest in between.

In spite of extensive efforts. no successful vaccine is available against this dreadful infectious disease. To support vaccine development. an immunoinformatics approach was applied to screen potential MHC class II restricted epitopes that can activate the immune cells. Initially. 37 epitopes derived from six stage-dependent. over-expressed antigens were predicted. which were presented by at least 26 diverse MHC class II allele. Based on a population coverage analysis and HLA cross presentation ability. six of the 37 epitopes were selected for further analysis. Stimulation with synthetic peptide alone or as a cocktail triggered intracellular IFN-γ production. Moreover. a specific IgG class of antibodies was detected in the serum of active VL cases against P1. P4. P5 and P6 in order to evaluate the peptide effect on the humoral immune response. Additionally. most of the peptides. except P2. were found to be non-inducers of CD4+ IL-10 against both active VL as well as treated VL subjects.

Thus the different activities displayed by these proteins are mediated by spatially distinct domains. consistent with the specific chemical requirements of each activity. Indeed. current evolutionary theory argues that the colocalization of diverse activities within an enzyme is likely to be a rare event. because it would compromise the existing activity of the protein. In contrast to this view. a potential example of multifunctional recruitment into a single protein domain is provided by CtCel5C-CE2. which contains an N-terminal module that displays cellulase activity and a C-terminal module. CtCE2. which exhibits a noncatalytic cellulose-binding function but also shares sequence identity with the CE2 family of esterases. Here we show that. unlike other CE2 members. the CtCE2 domain displays divergent catalytic esterase and noncatalytic carbohydrate binding functions. Intriguingly. these diverse activities are housed within the same site on the protein. Thus. a critical component of the active site of CtCE2. the catalytic Ser-His dyad. in harness with inserted aromatic residues. confers noncatalytic binding to cellulose whilst the active site of the domain retains its esterase activity. CtCE2 catalyses deacetylation of noncellulosic plant structural polysaccharides to deprotect these substrates for attack by other enzymes.

The formation of a RecA–ATP–ssDNA complex initiates all RecA activities and yet a complete structural and mechanistic description of this filament has remained elusive. An analysis of RecA–DNA interactions was performed using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides. A direct comparison was made between fluorescein and several fluorescent nucleosides.

ChuS is capable of using ascorbic acid or cytochrome P450 reductase-NADPH as electron sources for heme oxygenation. CO detection confirmed that ChuS is a HO. and we have identified it in pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7.

Such GH family expansion is exemplified by the 23 family GH92 glycosidases encoded by the B. thetaiotaomicron genome. Here we show that these are α-mannosidases that act via a single displacement mechanism to utilize host N-glycans. The three-dimensional structure of two GH92 mannosidases defines a family of two-domain proteins in which the catalytic center is located at the domain interface. providing acid (glutamate) and base (aspartate) assistance to hydrolysis in a Ca 2+-dependent manner.

These enzymes are found in different GH sequence–based families. Considerable research has probed the role of higher eukaryotic “GH38” α−mannosides that play a key role in the modification and diversification of hybrid N-glycans; processes with strong cellular links to cancer and autoimmune disease. The most extensively studied of these enzymes is the Drosophila GH38 α−mannosidase II. which has been shown to be a retaining α−mannosidase that targets both α−1.3 and α−1.6 mannosyl linkages. an activity that enables the enzyme to process GlcNAc(Man)5(GlcNAc)2 hybrid N-glycans to GlcNAc(Man)3(GlcNAc)2. Far less well understood is the observation that many bacterial species. predominantly but not exclusively pathogens and symbionts. also possess putative GH38 α−mannosidases whose activity and specificity is unknown.  Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that the Streptococcus pyogenes (M1 GAS SF370) GH38 enzyme (Spy1604; hereafter SpGH38) is an α−mannosidase with specificity for α−1.3 mannosidic linkages. The 3D X-ray structure of SpGH38. obtained in native form at 1.9 Å resolution and in complex with the inhibitor swainsonine (Ki 18 µM) at 2.6 Å. reveals a canonical GH38 five-domain structure in which the catalytic “–1” subsite shows high similarity with the Drosophila enzyme. including the catalytic Zn2+ ion.

Commensurate with N-glycosylation being an abundant form of protein glycosylation that has critical functional roles in the host. some host-adapted bacteria possess the machinery to process N-linked glycans. The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae depolymerizes complex N-glycans with enzymes that sequentially trim a complex N-glycan down to the Man3GlcNAc2 core prior to the release of the glycan from the protein by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoD). which cleaves between the two GlcNAc residues. Here we examine the capacity of S. pneumoniae to process high-mannose N-glycans and transport the products. Through biochemical and structural analyses we demonstrate that S. pneumoniae also possesses an α-(1.2)-mannosidase (SpGH92). This enzyme has the ability to trim the terminal α-(1.2)-linked mannose residues of high-mannose N-glycans to generate Man5GlcNAc2. Through this activity SpGH92 is able to produce a substrate for EndoD. which is not active on high-mannose glycans with α-(1.2)-linked mannose residues. Binding studies and X-ray crystallography show that NgtS. the solute binding protein of an ABC transporter (ABCNG). is able to bind Man5GlcNAc. a product of EndoD activity. with high affinity. Finally. we evaluated the contribution of EndoD and ABCNG to growth of S. pneumoniae on a model N-glycosylated glycoprotein. and the contribution of these enzymes and SpGH92 to virulence in a mouse model.

The catalytic activity of this exo-α-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase is directed towards a rare carbohydrate motif. N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine-α-1.4-d-galactose. which is displayed on the class III mucins deep within the gastric mucosa. In addition to the family 89 glycoside hydrolase catalytic module this enzyme has six modules that share sequence similarity to the family 32 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM32s). suggesting the enzyme has considerable capacity to adhere to carbohydrates. Here we suggest that two of the modules. CBM32-1 and CBM32-6. are not functional as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and demonstrate that three of the CBMs. CBM32-3. CBM32-4. and CBM32-5. are indeed capable of binding carbohydrates. CBM32-3 and CBM32-4 have a novel binding specificity for N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine-α-1.4-d-galactose. which thus complements the specificity of the catalytic module. The X-ray crystal structure of CBM32-4 in complex with this disaccharide reveals a mode of recognition that is based primarily on accommodation of the unique bent shape of this sugar. In contrast. as revealed by a series of X-ray crystal structures and quantitative binding studies. CBM32-5 displays the structural and functional features of galactose binding that is commonly associated with CBM family 32.

1038152,Roles of heat shock proteins in apoptosis. oxidative stress. human inflammatory diseases. and cancer,2018,Paul Ikwegbue and Priscilla Masamba and Babatunji Oyinloye and Abidemi Kappo,11,,1,2,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play cytoprotective activities under pathological conditions through the initiation of protein folding. repair. refolding of misfolded peptides. and possible degradation of irreparable proteins. Excessive apoptosis. resulting from increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) cellular levels and subsequent amplified inflammatory reactions. is well known in the pathogenesis and progression of several human inflammatory diseases (HIDs) and cancer. Under normal physiological conditions. ROS levels and inflammatory reactions are kept in check for the cellular benefits of fighting off infectious agents through antioxidant mechanisms; however. this balance can be disrupted under pathological conditions. thus leading to oxidative stress and massive cellular destruction. Therefore. it becomes apparent that the interplay between oxidant-apoptosis-inflammation is critical in the dysfunction of the antioxidant system and. most importantly. in the progression of HIDs. Hence. there is a need to maintain careful balance between the oxidant-antioxidant inflammatory status in the human body. HSPs are known to modulate the effects of inflammation cascades leading to the endogenous generation of ROS and intrinsic apoptosis through inhibition of pro-inflammatory factors. thereby playing crucial roles in the pathogenesis of HIDs and cancer. We propose that careful induction of HSPs in HIDs and cancer. especially prior to inflammation. will provide good therapeutics in the management and treatment of HIDs and cancer.

Antimicrobial Peptides and Human Inflammatory Diseases,2015,Babatunji Emmanuel Oyinloye and Abiola Fatimah Adenowo and Abidemi Paul Kappo,8,Pharmaceuticals,2,151-175,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Excessive free radical generation. especially reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress in the biological system. has been implicated in the pathogenesis and pathological conditions associated with diverse human inflammatory diseases (HIDs). Although inflammation which is considered advantageous is a defensive mechanism in response to xenobiotics and foreign pathogen; as a result of cellular damage arising from oxidative stress. if uncontrolled. it may degenerate to chronic inflammation when the ROS levels exceed the antioxidant capacity. Therefore. in the normal resolution of inflammatory reactions. apoptosis is acknowledged to play a crucial role. while on the other hand. dysregulation in the induction of apoptosis by enhanced ROS production could also result in excessive apoptosis identified in the pathogenesis of HIDs. Apparently. a careful balance must be maintained in this complex environment. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been proposed in this review as an excellent candidate capable of playing prominent roles in maintaining this balance. Consequently. in novel drug design for the treatment and management of HIDs. AMPs are promising candidates owing to their size and multidimensional properties as well as their wide spectrum of activities and indications of reduced rate of resistance.

Chronic ethanol administration resulted in a statistically significant elevation of serum alanine aminotransferases and triglyceride levels. as well as a decrease in reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase which was dramatically attenuated by the co-administration of the plant extract. Histological changes were related to these indices. Co-administration of the plant extract suppressed the elevation of lipid peroxidation. restored the reduced glutathion. and enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity.

Nigeria,2015,PA Okiki and IA Osibote and O Balogun and BE Oyinloye and O Idris and Adelegan Olufunke and SO Asoso and PT Olagbemide,9,Advances in Biological Research,6,436-443,,Moringa oleifera is a plant that is in high demand for its nutritional and medicinal values. This study was aimed at assessing the nutritional and phytochemical constituents of the leaf of Moringa oleifera cultivated in Ado Ekiti. Nigeria. Samples of leaf of M. oleifera were obtained from six different moringa cultivating locations in Ado Ekiti. The proximate analysis of dried leaf of M. oleifera showed that it is highly rich in protein (28.00±0.33%) and metabolizable energy (2625.25±79.30 Kcal/Kg). with appreciable levels of fat (3.88%). ash (9.88%). crude fibre (12.57%) and carbohydrate (37.87%). The leaf was found to be rich in minerals and vitamins. It contained high concentrations of Zn. Mg. Ca. K and PO. respectively. 64.17±2.04. 2+ 2+ 2++ 3-4 643.33±6.06. 82.50±6.89. 430.00±8.37 and 50.43±2.05 mg/100g. Low. but appreciable levels of Fe. ascorbic 2+ acid. thiamin. riboflavin and niacin were equally obtained. Phytochemical analysis revealed high concentrations of alkaloids. flavonoids and saponins; 446.67±12.11. 846.67±11.07 and 844.17±27.82 mg/100g respectively. The concentrations of phytates and tannin were high. but with low oxalate content. No cyanogenic glycoside was detected. A satisfactory oxygen radical absorption capacity level of 37.23% and very low anti-protease activity (0.13±0.06 mg/100g) were obtained. The rich array of results obtained in this study displays that M. oleifera is a multipurpose plant that could contribute immensely towards meeting both human and livestock nutritional requirement.,True,z68LNOIAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,27,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abimbola_Okiki/publication/288516350_Evaluation_of_Proximate_Minerals_Vitamins_and_Phytochemical_Composition_of_Moringa_oleifera_Lam_Cultivated_in_Ado_Ekiti_Nigeria/links/5681cfce08ae051f9aec5b85.pdf,18199093784163295017,/scholar?cites=18199093784163295017,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abimbola_Okiki/publication/288516350_Evaluation_of_Proximate_Minerals_Vitamins_and_Phytochemical_Composition_of_Moringa_oleifera_Lam_Cultivated_in_Ado_Ekiti_Nigeria/links/5681cfce08ae051f9aec5b85.pdf,0,0,0

This study investigates the protective effect of Monodora myristica (MM) on cadmium-induced liver damage in experimental animals. Male Wistar albino rats were maintained on 200 mg/L cadmium: Cd (Cd as CdCl2) in the animals’ main drinking water to induce hepatotoxicity. Added to this. the animals received aqueous extracts of MM at a dose of 200 or 400 and 20 mg/kg bw of Livolin forte (LF) for 21 days. At the end of the experiment. levels of serum enzyme biomarkers (alanine transaminase. alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase) as well as total cholesterol (TC). triacylglyceride (TG) and malondialdehyde were significantly raised in the cadmium treated groups. Conversely. cadmium treatment elicited noticeable decrease in hepatic enzymatic and non …,True,z68LNOIAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,26,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2228-z,4770397970491419255,/scholar?cites=4770397970491419255,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2228-z,0,0,0
1038161,Prophylactic effects of Ethanolic extract of Irvingia gabonensis stem bark against Cadmium-induced Toxicity in albino rats,2014,Oluwafemi Adeleke Ojo and Basiru Olaitan Ajiboye and Babatunji Emmanuel Oyinloye and Adebola Busola Ojo,2014,Advances in Pharmaceutics,,,Hindawi Publishing Corporation,The prophylactic effect of ethanolic extract of Irvingia gabonensis stem bark on cadmium-induced oxidative damage in male albino rats’ liver was investigated. Male Wistar rats were divided into control. cadmium. and treatment groups. In the prophylactic experiment. Irvingia gabonensis (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight) was administered by oral gavage for 21 days before exposure to cadmium. Antioxidant marker enzymes such as reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. catalase (CAT). glutathione peroxidase (GPx). superoxide dismutase (SOD). and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were determined in the liver and heart alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities were monitored and histological examination was carried out. Results indicate that cadmium-induced rats had significantly increased relative weight of liver and heart when compared to controls. Treatment with Irvingia gabonensis at 200 and 400 mg/kg caused a significant decrease in relative weight of the organs. In cadmium-induced rats. serum ALT and AST activities and levels of LPO were increased whereas hepatic and cardiac marker enzymes significantly decreased. Furthermore. histological alteration in liver and aorta was observed in cadmium untreated rats and was ameliorated in cadmium rats treated with Irvingia gabonensis. In conclusion. the extract indicates antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties that eliminate the deleterious effects of toxic metabolites of cadmium.,True,z68LNOIAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,26,https://www.hindawi.com/archive/2014/894610/abs/,4726062023403970951,/scholar?cites=4726062023403970951,,https://www.hindawi.com/archive/2014/894610/abs/,0,0,0
