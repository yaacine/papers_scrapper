A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices. and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions. which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,37277,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/286/5439/509.abstract,10638755925462666384,/scholar?cites=10638755925462666384,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9910332.pdf%3Forigin%3Dpublication_detail,0,0,0

23338,Linked: The New Science Of Networks,2002.0,Albert-László Barabási,,,,,Basic Books,A number of years ago I had the occasion to estimate the impact of supersymmetry on the particle physics literature. Although there was earlier work. the subject drew much attention after the 1974 Wess/Zumino paper. 1 which applied graded Lie algebras to four-dimensional field theory. Supersymmetry relates fermions and bosons in a supermultiplet. and is an integral part of many efforts to find a theory more fundamental than the standard model. By 1985 there were about 2800 papers on the subject in the SLAC-SPIRES database.At this writing there are over 31 000 papers. in spite of the fact that there is still no experimental evidence for this symmetry in particle physics. A search on the word ‘‘neutrino.’’which most definitely exists. yields only about half this number.

For example. relatively simple organisms grow. persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions. an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network 1. Complex communication networks 2 display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction. local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks. called scale-free networks. which include the World-Wide Web 3. 4. 5. the Internet 6. social networks 7 and …,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,9230,https://www.nature.com/articles/35019019?draft\u003djournal,10935078332190898653,/scholar?cites=10935078332190898653,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0008064,0,0,0

23345,Fractal concepts in surface growth,1995.0,A-L Barabási and HE Stanley,,,,,Cambridge University Press,Fractals and surfaces are two of the most widely-studied areas of modern physics. In fact. most surfaces in nature are fractals. In this book. Drs. Barabási and Stanley explain how fractals can be successfully used to describe and predict the morphology of surface growth. The authors begin by presenting basic growth models and the principles used to develop them. They next demonstrate how models can be used to answer specific questions about surface roughness. In the second half of the book. they discuss in detail two classes of phenomena: fluid flow in porous media and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In each case. the authors review the model and analytical approach. and present experimental results. This book is the first attempt to unite the subjects of fractals and surfaces. and it will appeal to advanced undergraduate and graduate students in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. Because of the technological importance of MBE. it will also be of interest to scientists. particularly materials scientists. working in industry and research.

We apply these tools to several real networks. finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network’s degree distribution.

The theory they present. however. is inconsistent with empirically observed properties of the Web link structure. Barabási and Albert write that because “of the preferential attachment. a vertex that acquires more connections than another one will increase its connectivity at a higher rate; thus. an initial difference in the connectivity between two vertices will increase further as the network grows.... Thus older... vertices increase their connectivity at the expense of the younger... ones. leading over time to some vertices that are highly connected. a ‘rich-get-richer’phenomenon”[figure 2C of (1)].

Next. we queried the InterNIC database (using the WHOIS search tool at www. networksolutions. com) for the date on which the site was originally registered.

For example. in social networks some individuals acquire more social links than others. or on the www some webpages attract considerably more links than others. We find that this competition for links translates into multiscaling. ie a fitness-dependent dynamic exponent. allowing fitter nodes to overcome the more connected but less fit ones.

Introducing null models where event sequences are appropriately shuffled. we are able to distinguish between the contributions of different impeding effects. The slowing down of spreading is found to be caused mainly by weight-topology correlations and the bursty activity patterns of individuals.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:08ZZubdj9fEC,620,https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.83.025102,668036838613022522,/scholar?cites=668036838613022522,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.2125,0,0,0

James Gleick's Chaos introduced the world to complexity. Now. Albert-László Barabási's Linked reveals the next major scientific leap: the study of networks. We've long suspected that we live in a small world. where everything is connected to everything else. Indeed. networks are pervasive--from the human brain to the Internet to the economy to our group of friends. These linkages. it turns out. aren't random. All networks. to the great surprise of scientists. have an underlying order and follow simple laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of these networks will help us do some amazing things. from designing the optimal organization of a firm to stopping a disease outbreak before it spreads catastrophically. In Linked. Barabási. a physicist whose work has revolutionized the study of networks. traces the development of this rapidly unfolding science and introduces us to the scientists carrying out this pioneering work. These"" new cartographers"" are mapping networks in a wide range of scientific disciplines. proving that social networks. corporations. and cells are more similar than they are different. and providing important new insights into the interconnected world around us. This knowledge. says Barabási. can shed light on the robustness of the Internet. the spread of fads and viruses. even the future of democracy. Engaging and authoritative.

Ltd,Contemporary classification of human disease derives from observational correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Characterizing disease in this way established a nosology that has served clinicians well to the current time. and depends on observational skills and simple laboratory tools to define the syndromic phenotype. Yet. this time‐honored diagnostic strategy has significant shortcomings that reflect both a lack of sensitivity in identifying preclinical disease. and a lack of specificity in defining disease unequivocally. In this paper. we focus on the latter limitation. viewing it as a reflection both of the different clinical presentations of many diseases (variable phenotypic expression). and of the excessive reliance on Cartesian reductionism in establishing diagnoses.

We present evidence that the structure of the PDN is relevant to the understanding of illness progression by showing that (1) patients develop diseases close in the network to those they already have; (2) the progression of disease along the links of the network is different for patients of different genders and ethnicities; (3) patients diagnosed with diseases which are more highly connected in the PDN tend to die sooner than those affected by less connected diseases; and (4) diseases that tend to be preceded by others in the PDN tend to be more connected than diseases that precede other illnesses. and are associated with higher degrees of mortality.

We show that for short time scales. where the effect of nonlinear terms is negligible. the continuum theory predicts ripple formation.

We find that connected disease pairs display higher correlated reaction flux rate. corresponding enzyme-encoding gene coexpression. and higher comorbidity than those that have no metabolic link between them.

The understanding of the origin of such bursty patterns is hindered by the lack of tools to compare different systems using a common framework. Here we propose to characterize the bursty nature of real signals using orthogonal measures quantifying two distinct mechanisms leading to burstiness: the interevent time distribution and the memory. We find that while the burstiness of natural phenomena is rooted in both the interevent time distribution and memory. for human dynamics memory is weak. and the bursty character is due to the changes in the interevent time distribution.

Typically. control has multiple prerequisites: it requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between the system’s components. a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that govern the temporal behavior of each component. and an ability to influence the state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep roots in dynamical systems and control theory. notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks. inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems?

While our social interactions have always been constrained by geography. it has been impossible. due to practical difficulties. to evaluate the nature of this restriction on social group structure.

It is typically neither feasible nor necessary to control the entire network. prompting us to explore target control: the efficient control of a preselected subset of nodes. We show that the structural controllability approach used for full control overestimates the minimum number of driver nodes needed for target control. Here we develop an alternate ‘k-walk’theory for directed tree networks. and we rigorously prove that one node can control a set of target nodes if the path length to each target node is unique. For more general cases. we develop a greedy algorithm to approximate the minimum set of driver nodes sufficient for target control.

In particular. we find that if all nodes are directly driven. control is energetically feasible. as the maximum energy increases sublinearly with the system size. If. however. we aim to control a system through a single node. control in some directions is energetically prohibitive. increasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between. the maximum energy decays exponentially when the number of driver nodes increases.

Ltd,The impact of disease‐causing defects is often not limited to the products of a mutated gene but. thanks to interactions between the molecular components. may also affect other cellular functions. resulting in potential comorbidity effects. By combining information on cellular interactions. disease‐‐gene associations. and population‐level disease patterns extracted from Medicare data. we find statistically significant correlations between the underlying structure of cellular networks and disease comorbidity patterns in the human population.

In particular. numerous recent studies have lead to an unexpected consensus: the considerable variability in the characteristic travelled distance of individuals coexists with a high degree of predictability of their future locations. Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and GPS data. we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes. we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings.

We find that as randomly deposited particles diffuse and aggregate they configure themselves into a wide variety of fractal structures characterized by a length scale L 1. We introduce an exponent γ that tunes the way the diffusion coefficient changes with cluster size: if the values of γ are very large. only single particles can move. if they are smaller. all clusters can move.

Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes. from information spreading to accessibility. by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature. we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can. compared to their static counterparts. reach controllability faster. demand orders of magnitude less control energy. and have control trajectories. that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks.

Such approaches build on the assumption that protein interaction networks can be viewed as maps in which diseases can be identified with localized perturbation within a certain neighborhood. The identification of these neighborhoods. or disease modules. is therefore a prerequisite of a detailed investigation of a particular pathophenotype. While numerous heuristic methods exist that successfully pinpoint disease associated modules. the basic underlying connectivity patterns remain largely unexplored. In this work we aim to fill this gap by analyzing the network properties of a comprehensive corpus of 70 complex diseases. We find that disease associated proteins do not reside within locally dense communities and instead identify connectivity significance as the most predictive quantity. This quantity inspires the design of a novel Disease Module Detection (DIAMOnD) algorithm to identify the full disease module around a set of known disease proteins.

Here. we show that these nanostructures have inherently nonlinear origin. first appearing when the nonlinear terms start to dominate the surface dynamics. Depending on the sign of the nonlinear terms. determined by the shape of the collision cascade. the surface can develop regular islands or holes with identical dynamical features. and while the size of these nanostructures is independent of flux and temperature. it can be modified by tuning the ion energy.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,151,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1343468,17296957769149658255,/scholar?cites=17296957769149658255,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0008111,0,0,0

With suitable inputs. PPI networks drive the cells to diverse functional outcomes such as cell proliferation or cell death. Here. we characterize the structural controllability of a large directed human PPI network comprising 6.339 proteins and 34.813 interactions. This network allows us to classify proteins as “indispensable.” “neutral.” or “dispensable.” which correlates to increasing. no effect. or decreasing the number of driver nodes in the network upon removal of that protein. We find that 21% of the proteins in the PPI network are indispensable.

Recent advances indicate that control over the system can be achieved through a minimum driver node set (MDS). The existence of multiple MDS's suggests that nodes do not participate in control equally. prompting us to quantify their participations. Here we introduce control capacity quantifying the likelihood that a node is a driver node. To efficiently measure this quantity. we develop a random sampling algorithm. This algorithm not only provides a statistical estimate of the control capacity. but also bridges the gap between multiple microscopic control configurations and macroscopic properties of the network under control. We demonstrate that the possibility of being a driver node decreases with a node's in-degree and is independent of its out-degree.

We find that career movements are not only temporally and spatially localized. but also characterized by a high degree of stratification in institutional ranking. When cross-group movement occurs. we find that while going from elite to lower-rank institutions on average associates with modest decrease in scientific performance. transitioning into elite institutions does not result in subsequent performance gain. These results offer empirical evidence on institutional level career choices and movements and have potential implications for science policy.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:mel-f30kHHgC,118,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04770?origin=ppub,1171732480802027203,/scholar?cites=1171732480802027203,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04770?origin=ppub,0,0,0

And for many. the stories would seem to involve genius in isolation—the lone physicist divorced from other sciences. unperturbed by societal beliefs. But the reality is quite different: physics has always been in a constant dialogue with other disciplines. be it mathematics. chemistry or theology. This dialogue is largely driven by methodology: what traverses disciplinary boundaries is the idea that complex phenomena can be understood in terms of a small number of universal laws3.In this era of interdisciplinary science. of biological physics. network science and econophysics. defining physics as the science of the properties of matter and energy3 is increasingly outdated and inaccurate.

We then predicted through virtual screening dozens of potential inhibitors for several enzymes of these reactions and showed experimentally that a subset of these inhibited both enzyme activities in vitro and bacterial cell viability.

Molecular crowding in a cell's cytoplasm is one such potential constraint. as it limits the solvent capacity available to metabolic enzymes.Using a recently introduced flux balance modeling framework (FBAwMC) here we demonstrate that this constraint determines a metabolic switch in E. coli cells when they are shifted from low to high growth rates. The switch is characterized by a change in effective optimization strategy. the excretion of acetate at high growth rates. and a global reorganization of E. coli metabolic fluxes. the latter being partially confirmed by flux measurements of central metabolic reactions …,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:hsZV8lGYWTMC,110,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1752-0509-2-7,4419012912230890000,/scholar?cites=4419012912230890000,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1752-0509-2-7,0,0,0

Yet. the heavy burden of both false positive and false negative protein-protein interaction data casts doubt on the broader usefulness of these interaction sets. Approaches focusing on one-protein-at-a-time have been powerfully employed to demonstrate the high degree of conservation of proteins participating in numerous interactions; here. we expand his 'node' focused paradigm to investigate the relative persistence of 'link' based evolutionary signals in a protein interaction network of S. cerevisiae and point out the value of this relatively untapped source of information. The trend for highly connected proteins to be preferably conserved in evolution is stable. even in the context of tremendous noise in the underlying protein interactions as well as in the assignment of orthology among five higher eukaryotes. We find that local clustering around interactions correlates with preferred evolutionary conservation of the participating proteins; furthermore the correlation between high local clustering and evolutionary conservation is accompanied by a stable elevated degree of coexpression of the interacting proteins. We use this conserved interaction data. combined with P. falciparum /Yeast orthologs. as proof-of-principle that high-order network topology can be used comparatively to deduce local network structure in non-model organisms.

This has a wide array of potential applications. ranging from emergency response and detection to traffic control and management. Previous studies have shown that human communications are both temporally and spatially localized following the onset of emergencies. indicating that social propagation is a primary means to propagate situational awareness. We study real anomalous events using country-wide mobile phone data. finding that information flow during emergencies is dominated by repeated communications. We further demonstrate that the observed communication patterns cannot be explained by inherent reciprocity in social networks. and are universal across different demographics.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:C33y2ycGS3YC,62,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03997,15765345823369427212,/scholar?cites=15765345823369427212,,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03997,0,0,0

Due to the frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals. the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution. The cohesive groups of people in such networks can grow by recruiting new members. or contract by loosing members; two (or more) groups may merge into a single community. while a large enough social group can split into several smaller ones; new communities are born and old ones may disappear.

Although some disease genes are expressed only in selected tissues. the expression patterns of disease genes alone cannot explain the observed tissue specificity of human diseases. Here we hypothesize that for a disease to manifest itself in a particular tissue. a whole functional subnetwork of genes (disease module) needs to be expressed in that tissue. Driven by this hypothesis. we conducted a systematic study of the expression patterns of disease genes within the human interactome. We find that genes expressed in a specific tissue tend to be localized in the same neighborhood of the interactome. By contrast. genes expressed in different tissues are segregated in distinct network neighborhoods.

WIPER is intended to provide emergency planners and responders with an integrated system that will help to detect possible emergencies. as well as to suggest and evaluate possible courses of action to deal with the emergency. The system is designed as a multi-agent system using web services and the service oriented architecture. Components of the system for detecting and mitigating emergency situations can be added and removed from the system as the need arises. WIPER is designed to evaluate potential plans of action using a series of GIS enabled Agent-Based simulations that are grounded on realtime data from cell phone network providers. The system relies on the DDDAS concept. the interactive use of partial aggregate and detailed realtime data to continuously update the system and allow emergency planners to stay updated on the situation.

Many observed networks can be viewed as only samples of some true underlying network. Such is frequently the case. for example. in the monitoring and study of massive. online social networks. We study the problem of how to estimate the degree distribution—an object of fundamental interest—of a true underlying network from its sampled network. In particular. we show that this problem can be formulated as an inverse problem. Playing a key role in this formulation is a matrix relating the expectation of our sampled degree distribution to the true underlying degree distribution. Under many network sampling designs. this matrix can be defined entirely in terms of the design and is found to be ill-conditioned. As a result. our inverse problem frequently is ill-posed. Accordingly. we offer a constrained. penalized weighted …,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:GHsHDPAyICYC,48,https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1430226089,17675043421350606266,/scholar?cites=17675043421350606266,,https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aoas/1430226089,0,0,0

Reply: In a recent Comment [1]. RD Johnson et al. argued that the two magnetic structures. Ą2 and Ą4. that we had adopted in a Letter [2] are not compatible with the observed electric polarization. We agree with their assertion that for temperatures below TSR ($480 K). the components of the four magnetization vectors presented in a Letter [2] cannot support a polarization as they are described by nonpolar Ą2 irrep (or Ą ž 3 according to Bertaut’s notation [1]). Similarly. Ą4 irrep (or a linear combination of Ą ž 2 and Ą ž 3 irreps according to RD Johnson et al.[1]) used to describe the magnetic symmetry for temperatures between TSR and TNš¼ 670 KŽ is not compatible with a polar structure either.

On the basis of spin-glass theory. we expect that the collective-influence solution has only a small overlap with the optimal solution. and hence must be treated with caution. However. the influencers found by collective influence are more effective in destroying a network than nodes selected by other methods.

Despite a decade of extensive studies. network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix (e.g. adjacency pattern. sign pattern or degree sequence) can be inferred from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here. we rigorously derive the necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix. Counterintuitively. we find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself. requiring equally informative temporal data.

While recently there has been much progress in understanding the general properties of multilayer networks. our understanding of how to control such systems remains limited. One fundamental aspect that makes this endeavor challenging is that each layer can operate at a different time scale; thus. we cannot directly apply standard ideas from structural control theory of individual networks. Here we address the problem of controlling multilayer and multi-time-scale networks focusing on two-layer multiplex networks with one-to-one interlayer coupling.

The rough morphology development is known to cause substantial variations in the sputtering yields. In this article. we present a theoretical model describing the sputter yields from random. self-affine surfaces subject to energetic ion bombardment. We employ the Sigmund's theory of ion sputtering. modified for the case of self-affine surfaces. to compute the sputter yields. We find that the changes in the sputtering yield. associated with the non-planar surface morphology. are strongly dependent on the parameters characterizing the surface roughness (such as the saturation width and the correlation length) and the incident ion beam (such as the incident ion energy and the deposited energy widths).

This dichotomy is partly rooted in the difficulty to distinguish performance. an individual measure that captures the actions of a performer. from success. a collective measure that captures a community’s reactions to these actions. Yet. finding the relationship between the two measures is essential for all areas that aim to objectively reward excellence. from science to business. Here we quantify the relationship between performance and success by focusing on tennis. an individual sport where the two quantities can be independently measured. We show that a predictive model. relying only on a tennis player’s performance in tournaments. can accurately predict an athlete’s popularity. both during a player’s active years and after retirement. Hence the model establishes a direct link between performance and momentary popularity.

We collected data on the time dependent activity of five natural and technological networks. finding evidence of orders of magnitude differences in the fluxes of individual nodes. This dynamical inhomogeneity reflects the emergence of localized high flux regions or “hot spots”. carrying an overwhelming fraction of the network’s activity.

Here. we focus on the properties of biological networks. discussing their scale-free and hierarchical features. We illustrate the major network characteristics using examples from the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli. We also discuss the principles of network utilization. acknowledging that the interactions in a real network have unequal strengths.

Here we study four mobile phone-based services available to over six million subscribers. allowing us to simultaneously monitor the communication network between individuals and the time-resolved service usage patterns.

We therefore collect threat log data in a university network to study the patterns of threat activity for individual hosts. We relate this information to the properties of each host as observed through network-wide scans. establishing associations between the network services a host is running and the kinds of threats to which it is susceptible. We propose a methodology to associate services to threats inspired by the tools used in genetics to identify statistical associations between mutations and diseases.

Integration of functional and network information may help in overcoming this limitation and identifying new susceptibility loci. Using GWAS and comorbidity data. we present a network-based approach to predict candidate genes for lipid and lipoprotein traits. We apply a prediction pipeline incorporating interactome. co-expression. and comorbidity data to Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) GWAS for four traits of interest. identifying phenotypically coherent modules. These modules provide insights regarding gene involvement in complex phenotypes with multiple susceptibility alleles and low effect sizes. To experimentally test our predictions. we selected four candidate genes and genotyped representative SNPs in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Cardiovascular Cohort. We found significant associations with LDL-C and total-cholesterol levels for a synonymous SNP (rs234706) in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene (p = 1 × 10−5 and adjusted-p = 0.013. respectively). Further. liver samples taken from 206 patients revealed that patients with the minor allele of rs234706 had significant dysregulation of CBS (p = 0.04). Despite the known biological role of CBS in lipid metabolism. SNPs within the locus have not yet been identified in GWAS of lipoprotein traits. Thus. the GWAS-based Comorbidity Module (GCM) approach identifies candidate genes missed by GWAS studies. serving as a broadly applicable tool for the investigation of other complex disease phenotypes.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:qe6vwMD2xtsC,32,https://www.mcponline.org/content/12/11/3398.short,11185992415815404053,/scholar?cites=11185992415815404053,,https://www.mcponline.org/content/mcprot/12/11/3398.full.pdf,0,0,0

The yield is computed as a function of the parameters characterizing the surface morphology and the incident ion beam. using the Sigmund's theory of ion sputtering. We find that the surface morphology development may cause substantial variations in the sputter yields. depending on a complex interplay between the parameters characterizing the ripple structure and the incident ion beam.

We analyze theoretically the expressiveness of GCNs. arriving at a modular GCN design. using different propagation rules. Our modular design is capable of distinguishing graphs from different graph generation models for surprisingly small graphs. a notoriously difficult problem in network science.

Two major factors that can be used to identify COPD subtypes are muscle dysfunction/wasting and co-morbidity patterns. We hypothesized that COPD heterogeneity is in part the result of complex interactions between several genes and pathways. We explored the possibility of using a Systems Medicine approach to identify such pathways. as well as to generate predictive computational models that may be used in clinic practice. Our overarching goal is to generate clinically applicable predictive models that characterize COPD heterogeneity through a Systems Medicine approach. To this end we have developed a general framework. consisting of three steps/objectives: (1) feature identification. (2) model generation and statistical validation. and (3) application and validation of the predictive models in the clinical scenario. We used muscle dysfunction and co-morbidity as test cases for this framework. In the study of muscle wasting we identified relevant features (genes) by a network analysis and generated predictive models that integrate mechanistic and probabilistic models. This allowed us to characterize muscle wasting as a general de-regulation of pathway interactions. In the co-morbidity analysis we identified relevant features (genes/pathways) by the integration of gene-disease and disease-disease associations. We further present a detailed characterization of co-morbidities in COPD patients that was implemented into a predictive model.

23617,Hierarchical organization of modularity in complex networks,2003.0,Albert-László Barabási and Erzsébet Ravasz and Zoltán Oltvai,,,,46-65,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Many real networks in nature and society share two generic properties: they are scale-free and they display a high degree of clustering. We show that the scale-free nature and high clustering of real networks are the consequence of a hierarchical organization. implying that small groups of nodes form increasingly large groups in a hierarchical manner. while maintaining a scale-free topology.

Furthermore. we often need to do it within a given time window. so it is of practical importance to understand the trade-offs between the minimum number of driving/driven nodes and the minimum time required to reach a desired state. Therefore. we introduce the notion of actuation spectrum to capture such trade-offs. which we used to find that in many complex networks only a small fraction of driving (or driven) nodes is required to steer the network to a desired state within a relatively small time window. Furthermore. our empirical studies reveal that. even though synthetic network models are designed to present structural properties similar to those observed in real networks. their actuation spectra can be dramatically different.

We demonstrate that an alternate approach using network analysis can discriminate between topologically different distributions that have similar two-point correlations. We investigate two galaxy point distributions. one produced by a cosmological simulation and the other by a Lévy walk. For the cosmological simulation. we adopt the redshift z = 0.58 slice from Illustris and select galaxies with stellar masses greater than 108 M⊙. The two-point correlation function of these simulated galaxies follows a single power law. ξ(r) ∼ r−1.5. Then. we generate Lévy walks matching the correlation function and abundance with the simulated galaxies.

In biological systems. networks appear in many different disguises ranging from protein interactions to metabolic networks.

For many current scientific problems. however. it is not possible to predict the behavior of a system from an understanding of its (often identical) elementary constituents and their individual interactions. For these systems we need to develop new methods in order to gain insight into their properties and dynamics.

We show that if the treatment policy is selective. targeting sexually more active segments of the population for treatment. it can restore the epidemic threshold. Most important. we find that no matter how weakly biased is the policy towards the hubs. the threshold is finite.

This model allows us to understand many experiments of thin film deposition. In the Sec. 1. we describe the model. which incorporates deposition. particle and cluster diffusion. and aggregation. In Sec. 2. we study the dynamical evolution of the model. Finally. we analyze the effects of small cluster mobility and show that the introduction of cluster diffusion dramatically affects the dynamics of film growth. Some of these effects can be tested experimentally.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC,11,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218348X96000431,13081042020143619342,/scholar?cites=13081042020143619342,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9510141,0,0,0

Recent work has shown that surprisingly. temporal networks can enjoy tremendous control advantages over their static counterparts despite the fact that in temporal networks such paths are seldom instantaneously available. To understand the underlying reasons. here we systematically analyze the scaling behavior of a key control cost for temporal networks--the control energy. We show that the energy costs of controlling temporal networks are determined solely by the spectral properties of an"" effective"" Gramian matrix. analogous to the static network case. Surprisingly. we find that this scaling is largely dictated by the first and the last network snapshot in the temporal sequence. independent of the number of intervening snapshots. the initial and final states. and the number of driver nodes. Our results uncover the intrinsic laws governing why and when temporal networks save considerable control energy over their static counterparts.",True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:_mQi-xiA4oYC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06434,1123151875724036909,/scholar?cites=1123151875724036909,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06434,0,0,0

23734,New generation of mobile phone viruses and corresponding countermeasures,2010.0,Pu Wang and Marta C González and Ronaldo Menezes and Albert-László Barabási,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1012.3156,,,,The fast growing market for smart phones coupled with their almost continuous online presence makes these devices the new targets of virus writers. It has been recently found that the topological spread of MMS (Multimedia Message Services) viruses is highly restricted by the underlying fragmentation of the call graph. In this paper. we study MMS viruses under another type of spreading behavior: scanning. We find that hybrid MMS viruses including some level of scanning are more dangerous to the mobile community than their standard topological counterparts. However. the effectiveness of both scanning and topological behaviors in MMS viruses can generally be limited by two controlling methods:(i) decreasing susceptible handsets' market share (OS it runs) and (ii) improving monitoring capacity to limit the frequency in which MMS messages can be sent by the mobile viruses.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:nrtMV_XWKgEC,4,https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3156,546046892601820221,/scholar?cites=546046892601820221,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3156,0,0,0

Our predictability. to the extent that our choices and movements form a pattern. relies more on extrapolation of past behaviour—as exploited by web-based ‘recommender systems’ that draw on our purchase or browsing history—than on burst characteristics. Similar to avalanches and earthquakes. bursts have statistical orderliness but remain unpredictable as individual events.The underlying origin of ‘burstiness’ is unknown. These intense periods of activity are not a by-product of advanced cognition because they apply beyond human behaviour—to the different foraging patterns of animals. the transcriptional activity of genes. and evolutionary speciation. for example. But Barabási cannot say whether their ubiquity stems from the same cause or whether bursts are merely a statistical signature …,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:WzTVkKNmPSkC,4,https://www.nature.com/articles/465692a,10919025110289360425,/scholar?cites=10919025110289360425,,https://www.nature.com/articles/465692a,0,0,0

Although most empirical studies have focused on snapshots of these communities. thanks to frequent changes in the activity and communication patterns of individuals. the associated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution [6. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16]. Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is limited. but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and selfoptimisation of the society as a whole [17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22]. We have developed a new algorithm based on a clique percolation technique [23. 24]. that allows. for the first time. to investigate in detail the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such. to uncover basic relationships of the statistical features of community evolution. Our focus is on two networks of major interest. capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. observing that their communities are subject to a number of elementary evolutionary steps ranging from community formation to breakup and merging. representing new dimensions in their quantitative interpretation. We find that large groups persist longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership. suggesting that an ability to change the composition results in better adaptability and a longer lifetime for social groups.

Existing methods use graph-theoretic centrality measures and expensive message-passing algorithms. requiring knowledge of the underlying dynamics and its parameters. In this paper. we revisit this problem using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn P0. We establish a theoretical limit for the identification of P0 in a class of epidemic models. We evaluate our method against different epidemic models on both synthetic and a real-world contact network considering a disease with history and characteristics of COVID-19.% We observe that GNNs can identify P0 close to the theoretical bound on accuracy. without explicit input of dynamics or its parameters. In addition. GNN is over 100 times faster than classic methods for inference on arbitrary graph topologies. Our theoretical bound also shows that the epidemic is like a ticking clock. emphasizing the importance of early contact-tracing.

This has a number of consequences: First it allows us to simplify the way how we process and interpret data. as there is no need to view renaissance and modern scholarship as being fundamentally different. Second it fortifies the opinion that archaeology was not born thanks to the definitions of a single person in the 18th century. but emerged from the local and distributed activity of a large number of stakeholders. And finally it means that both our very own scholarly activity and the activity of our renaissance predecessors can be analyzed with the same tools.Today we can produce maps such as those shown in the figure with incredible ease. offering a big picture that preserves the original source in its initial granularity. without being affected by filtering based on preconceived concepts or simplistic dissections of art history into stereotypic periods.

Indeed. in social systems. the chance that two individuals know each other drops rapidly with the distance between them; in the cell. proteins predominantly interact with proteins in the same cellular compartment; in the brain. neurons mainly link to nearby neurons. Most modeling frameworks that aim to capture the empirically observed degree distributions tend to ignore these spatial constraints. In contrast. models that account for the role of the physical distance often predict bounded degree distributions. in disagreement with the empirical data. Here we address a long-standing gap in the spatial network literature by deriving several key network characteristics of spatial networks. from the analytical form of the degree distribution to path lengths and local clustering. The mathematically exact results predict the existence of two distinct phases. each governed by a different dynamical equation. with distinct testable predictions.

However. in many circumstances it is neither feasible nor necessary to control the entire network. This prompts us to explore how to efficiently control a subset of nodes in a network. ie.``targeted controllability.''We develop an alternate``k-walk''theory based on the fact that a single node can control a set of nodes provided the path length from the control node to each target node is unique. For the general case. we develop a greedy algorithm. based on k-walk theory. to identify the approximate minimal set of necessary driver nodes. We demonstrate that partial controllability has fundamentally different features when compared to full controllability.

This effective behaviour is also reflected by the autocorrelation function which can show power-law scaling A (τ)∼ τ− α for sequences of independent events with inter-event time distribution P (tie)∼ t− γ ie. and can indicate presence of non-existing correlations. Based on the generating function method and the Tauberian theorems one can show that for 1≤ γ≤ 2 the scaling law α+ γ= 2(1) holds [2]. We checked this relationship by numerical simulations. where we generate independent events with inter-event times sampled from a power-law distribution with a fixed exponent γ and calculate the autocorrelation function. As it is shown in Fig. 1. a the exponent relation in Eq. 1 holds for numerical results since for P (tie) with γ= 1.5 (blue symbols and straight line) the effective autocorrelation function (red symbols) scales as a power-law with an exponent α= 0.5 (dashed line).

Using the known enzyme-disease associations. we construct a human metabolic disease network in which nodes are diseases and two diseases are linked if the enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent metabolic reactions.

23811,The impact of non-Poisson contact processes on virus spreading,2005.0,Alexei Vázquez and Albert-Laszló Barabási,,DIMACS Computational and Mathematical Epidemiology Seminar Series,,,,Halting an epidemic outbreak in its early stages requires a detailed understanding of the contact dynamics between the agents capable of carrying the pathogen. While current epidemic models assume that agents interact at a uniform rate. following a Poisson process. here we provide evidence that for several computer and biological viruses the inter contact time distribution is heavy tailed. This non-Poisson contact dynamics results in a lengthy subexponential pre-outbreak regime. preceding the exponential growth in the number of infected individuals. The temporal inhomogeneity of the observed contact dynamics affects both the nature of the fluctuations in the pre-outbreak regime. as well as the immunization rate necessary to halt the outbreak. indicating that the timing of the contacts plays a hitherto unsuspected role in epidemic modeling.Humanity’s best chance at avoiding a global epidemic outbreak caused by a yet unknown virus is to rapidly recognize the new pathogen and intervene at the very early stages of its spreading process. Indeed. in the absence of a cure or vaccine. early recognition offers the best chance for contact tracing. isolation and quarantine. halting the virus before it turns into a pandemic. SARS and Ebola offer examples of successful early interventions [1–3]. and so does the AnnaKournikova (or VBSWG.

These interdependencies have inspired an extensive literature on coupled multilayer networks. assuming that a component failure in one network causes failures in the other network. a hard interdependence that results in a cascade of failures across multiple systems. While empirical evidence of such hard coupling is limited. the repair and recovery of a network requires resources typically supplied by other networks. resulting in well documented interdependencies induced by the recovery process. If the support networks are not functional. recovery will be slowed. Here we collected data on the recovery time of millions of power grid failures. finding evidence of universal nonlinear behavior in recovery following large perturbations. We develop a theoretical framework to address recovery coupling. predicting quantitative signatures different from the multilayer cascading failures. We then rely on controlled natural experiments to separate the role of recovery coupling from other effects like resource limitations. offering direct evidence of how recovery coupling affects a system's functionality.

23828,Predicting the Health Impact of Dietary Polyphenols Using a Network Medicine Framework,2020.0,Italo Faria do Valle and Harvey G Roweth and Michael W Malloy and Sofia Moco and Denis Barron and Elisabeth Battinelli and Joseph Loscalzo and Albert-Laszlo Barabasi,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Polyphenols. natural products present in most plant-based foods. play a protective role against several complex diseases through their antioxidant activity and by diverse molecular mechanisms. Here we developed a network medicine framework to uncover the mechanistic roles of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighborhoods of the human interactome. whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the known therapeutic effects of polyphenols. This finding allows us to predict that rosmarinic acid (RA) has a direct impact on platelet function. representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. and experimentally confirm that RA inhibits platelet aggregation and alpha granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Our framework represents a starting point for mechanistic interpretation of the health effects underlying food-related compounds. allowing us to integrate into a predictive framework knowledge on food metabolism. bioavailability. and drug interaction.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:t9Ks5LMjN0QC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.27.270173v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/08/28/2020.08.27.270173.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. the currently available comprehensive databases on food composition cover only a tiny fraction of the total number of chemicals present in our food. focusing on the nutritional components essential for our health. Indeed. thousands of other molecules. many of which have well documented health implications. remain untracked. To explore the body of knowledge available on food composition. we built FoodMine. an algorithm that uses natural language processing to identify papers from PubMed that potentially report on the chemical composition of garlic and cocoa. After extracting from each paper information on the reported quantities of chemicals. we find that the scientific literature carries extensive information on the detailed chemical components of food that is currently not integrated in databases.

23831,The Fundamentals of Predictability of Scientific Success,2019.0,Albert-Laszlo Barabasi,,,,,Northeastern University Boston United States,During 2018. our team has been focusing on understanding scientific success in a couple of aspects. including scientific ability. gender. social network. team. country. discipline. move. etc. To be specific. as we discuss next. we tackled several key questions. aiming to propose quantitative and predictive models to understand. explain and predict scientific success. 1. Ongoing Data curation and disambiguation This is one of the most critical tasks that facilitates the implementation of the whole line of work. by providing more accurate and expansive datasets. Tackling the author name ambiguity problem. we developed a method to identify authors with high accuracy. collaborating with a group from University of Massachusetts Amherst. Specifically. we employed several layers of information. from an authors affiliation to email address and the list of hisher collaborators. allowing us to uniquely identify each scientist. This method outperforms previous efforts indisambiguating the Web of Science dataset by providing a higher accuracy and covering a broader extent of data. 2. Ongoing Impact of network on scientific success We have started a new line of research to separate the social impacts of the scientific community on the perceived success of a scientist. Our analysis assumes that the impact of a scientist is strongly determined by the structure of her professional interaction network. defined as the list of scientists with whom one has collaborated or worked at the same institution or got to know them through a common collaborator.

23834,The fundamental advantages of temporal networks,2019.0,Aming Li and SP Cornelius and Yang-Yu Liu and Long Wang and AL Barabási,64.0,Bulletin of the American Physical Society,,,American Physical Society,Most networked systems of scientific interest are characterized by temporal links. meaning the network’s structure changes over time. Link temporality has been shown to hinder many dynamical processes. from information spreading to accessibility. by disrupting network paths. Considering the ubiquity of temporal networks in nature. we ask: Are there any advantages of the networks’ temporality? We use an analytical framework to show that temporal networks can. compared to their static counterparts. reach controllability faster. demand orders of magnitude less control energy. and have control trajectories. that are considerably more compact than those characterizing static networks. Thus. temporality ensures a degree of flexibility that would be unattainable in static networks. enhancing our ability to control them. Traditionally. network science has focused on static networks. whose links offer permanent connections between their nodes. Yet. it is increasingly recognized that most natural and social systems are best described as “temporal” networks. with links existing only intermittently. For example. within metabolic networks (1). the links correspond to brief chemical reactions; in social networks (2. 3). friendship links are inferred from face-to-face or digital communications of short duration. Such temporality has profound effects on most dynamical processes taking place on networks (4–7). slowing down synchronization and the diffusion of innovative information (4). impeding exploration and navigation (7). and raising barriers to accessibility (5). Similar limitations are expected for control—the ability to drive a system with input signals to any …,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:WTQy_8Ay2UsC,0,https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/yyl/files/1042.full_.pdf,,,,https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/yyl/files/1042.full_.pdf,0,0,0

Many dynamical processes on networks. including spreading processes such as SIR and SIS. are generally weakly non-linear and the core of the process consists of a diffusion process. However. while the diffusion may have a trivial fixed point where the probability distributions over all nodes becomes uniform or proportional to their degree. the nonlinearity generally results in the trivial fixed point becoming unstable. yielding non-trivial outcomes. Especially in real networks with modular and other internal structures. characterizing these outcomes requires numerical simulations. Here we report discovering a deep connection between these solutions and symmetry groups. In particular. we consider a multi-dimensional weakly non-linear dynamical process on a network and show that it is equivalent to a force-directed layout problem.

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. with a small nervous system of 302 identified neurons. it is possible to generate lesions with single cell resolution and infer the roles of individual neurons in behaviour. Here we present a dataset of ~300 video recordings representing the locomotor behaviour of animals carrying single-cell ablations of 5 different motorneurons. Each file includes a raw video of approximately 27.000 frames; each frame has also been segmented to yield the position. contour. and body curvature of the tracked animal. These recordings can be further analysed using publicly-available software to extract features relevant to behavioural phenotypes.

Following then the magnetic force of strategy. structural clusters engage in an efficient. dynamic dance toward the needle of strategic goals to achieve them together. If these theses are correct. then a deep understanding of the process owner–organization relationship can be gained only by a comprehensive mapping of the structure and function of all of the trees that form the organizational forest.

The nature of trade has shifted over time as the structure of the world economy has been pushed and pulled into new forms by processes of competition. Trade in renewable energy is expected to grow as more and more countries turn a green industrial policy towards a more sustainable global economy. The World Trade Organization estimates that it now accounts for 20% of global trade and the service sector is responsible for one-third of employment around the world. The international literature on trade and technology development focuses on two main mechanisms of knowledge accumulation.

Despite the very different nature of the components and the diversity of the interactions between them. they have one important thing in common: they can all be described as networks. In the past decade. the emerging field of network science has established new paradigms and tools to analyze and understand systems of interacting components and their collective properties.

Here we build a framework to quantify the sensitivity of complex networked system of coupled dynamic units. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of new macroscopic dynamic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We prove that these conditions are satisfied only for architectures with power-law degree distributions. Surprisingly. we find that highly connected nodes (ie hubs) only dominate the sensitivity of the network up to certain critical frequency.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:CC3C2HR4nz8C,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv161005264T/abstract,,,,,0,0,0
23849,System and Methods for Disease Module Detection,2016.0,,,,,,,The present disclosure discusses a system and method for disease module detection. More particularly. a protein network and list of seed proteins are provided to the system. The system iteratively selects one or more candidate proteins for inclusion in the list of seed proteins. The system calculates a connectivity factor for each of the connections of the candidate proteins to proteins listed as seed proteins. Responsive to the calculated connectivity factors the system adds one or more of the candidate proteins to list of seed proteins. At the end of the iterative process the list of seed proteins can be indicative of the disease module.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C,0,https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160232279A1/en,,,,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/17/98/f4/93b56a06e2671a/US20160232279A1.pdf,0,0,0
23850,Geometric graphs. the cosmic web and hypergraphs,2016.0,Bruno Coutinho,,,,,,With the technological advancements during the last decades. we have gathered. documented and mapped enormous data sets–from Instagram photos of cats to the interactions between proteins in a cell. Over the same period as this explosion of data emerged. network science has emerged as a vital new approach to understanding the complexities of networks and complex systems. In 1999 Professor Albert-László Barabási and Professor Réka Albert found that the topology of these networks are not trivial. For example. the distribution of connections per website on the World Wide Web follows a power law with the exponent γ= 2.1±0.1 [2]. As a direct consequence. a small fraction of sites contain a much larger number of links than one would expect if the distribution of connections per node followed a typical Poisson distribution. Similar effects were found in many other networks like the protein-protein interaction network [3]. In this thesis we show how network science can also be used to study the cosmic web. and in the later chapters we explore how a generalization of graphs. called a hypergraph. can not only produce a more faithful representation of complex systems. but also make some classic combinatorial problems easier to solve.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:8rLWgkbgOXQC,0,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9da5/7c61ec1a5c17c25c92253106fa89a043a45b.pdf,,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9da5/7c61ec1a5c17c25c92253106fa89a043a45b.pdf,0,0,0

Despite significant advances in uncovering the relationship between stability and network structure. little attention has been paid to the impact of the degree heterogeneity that exists in real ecosystems. Here we show that for networks with mixed interactions of competition and mutualism the degree heterogeneity always destabilizes the ecosystem. Surprisingly. for predator-prey interactions (eg. food webs) high heterogeneity is destabilizing yet moderate heterogeneity is stabilizing. These findings deepen our understanding of the stability of real ecosystems and may also have implications in studying the stability of more general complex dynamical systems.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC,0,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014APS..MAR.P1268L/abstract,,,,,0,0,0

When controlling a complex system one has to steer it from one point of its state space to another by an appropriate set of inputs. The state space complex systems operate in is high-dimensional with dimensionality equal to the system's size. The energy of control across directions span several decades of orders of magnitude exhibiting an extremely wide range. The control energy spectrum is dominated by a fat-tail that is largely independent of the properties of the network. As a result control is easy in most directions while it is very hard in few of them.

But we seldom study human behaviour with a similar approach. Every day we take many decisions according to our wish and whim. which makes us think that there is no more unpredictable test subject than a human being. This paper tells us about a research project which studied the behavioural patterns of millions of anonymous mobile phone users. only to prove this concept wrong. Although our memories are dominated by diversions from our daily routine. measurements indicate that human movements can be predicted with 93% accuracy.

23882,Editor's Summary,2005.0,Albert-László Barabási,,,,,,What determines the timing of human actions? A big question. but the science of human dynamics is here to tackle it. And its predictions are of practical value: for example. when ISPs decide what bandwidth an institution needs. they use a model of the likely timing and activity level of the individuals. Current models assume that an individual has a well defined probability of engaging in a specific action at a given moment. but evidence that the timing of human actions does not follow this pattern (of Poisson statistics) is emerging. Instead the delay between two consecutive events is best described by a heavy-tailed (power law) distribution. Albert-László Barabási proposes an explanation for the prevalence of this behaviour. The'bursty'nature of human dynamics. he finds. is a fundamental consequence of decision making.,True,vsj2slIAAAAJ:JH5k92_tO-AC,0,https://barabasi.com/f/174.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

In this regime the net currents are highly correlated. the spatial correlation function follows a logarithmic dependence. and the correlation length is of the order of the system size. For large external fields correlations disappear and only random net currents patterns are observed.
