1280164,Guiding goal modeling using scenarios,1998,Colette Rolland and Carine Souveyet and Camille Ben Achour,24,"Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on",12,1055-1071,IEEE,Even though goal modeling is an effective approach to requirements engineering. it is known to present a number of difficulties in practice. The paper discusses these difficulties and proposes to couple goal modeling and scenario authoring to overcome them. Whereas existing techniques use scenarios to concretize goals. we use them to discover goals. Our proposal is to define enactable rules which form the basis of a software environment called L'Ecritoire to guide the requirements elicitation process through interleaved goal modeling and scenario authoring. The focus of the paper is on the discovery of goals from scenarios. The discovery process is centered around the notion of a requirement chunk (RC) which is a pair <Goal. Scenario>. The paper presents the notion of RC. the rules to support the discovery of RCs and illustrates the application of the approach within L'Ecritoire using the ATM example.

Use of examples. scenes. narrative descriptions of contexts. mock-ups and prototypes-all these ideas can be called scenario-based approaches. although exact definitions are not easy beyond stating that these approaches emphasise some description of the real world. Experience seems to tell us that people react to ‘real things’ and that this helps in clarifying requirements. Indeed. the widespread acceptance of prototyping in system development points to the effectiveness of scenario-based approaches. However. we have little understanding about how scenarios should be constructed. little hard evidence about their effectiveness and even less idea about why they work …,True,AAMCoS4AAAAJ:t6usbXjVLHcC,351,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02802919.pdf,10088244855703250818,/scholar?cites=10088244855703250818,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.13.3662&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1280166,Guiding the construction of textual use case specifications,1998,Colette Rolland and Camille Ben Achour,25,Data & Knowledge Engineering,1,125-160,North-Holland,An approach for guiding the construction of use case specifications is presented. A use case specification comprises contextual information of the use case. its change history. the complete graph of possible pathways. attached requirements and open issues. The proposed approach delivers a use case specification as an unambiguous natural language text. This is done by a stepwise and guided process which progressively transforms initial and partial natural language descriptions of scenarios into well structured. integrated use case specifications. The basis of the approach is a set of linguistic patterns and linguistic structures. The former constitutes the deep structure of the use case specification whereas the latter corresponds to the surface structures. The paper presents the use case model. the linguistic basis and the guided process along with the associated guidelines and support rules.

1280167,Dynamic adaptation of service compositions with variability models,2014,Germán H Alférez and Vicente Pelechano and Raúl Mazo and Camille Salinesi and Daniel Diaz,91,Journal of Systems and Software,,24-47,Elsevier,Web services run in complex contexts where arising events may compromise the quality of the whole system. Thus. it is desirable to count on autonomic mechanisms to guide the self-adaptation of service compositions according to changes in the computing infrastructure. One way to achieve this goal is by implementing variability constructs at the language level. However. this approach may become tedious. difficult to manage. and error-prone. In this paper. we propose a solution based on a semantically rich variability model to support the dynamic adaptation of service compositions. When a problematic event arises in the context. this model is leveraged for decision-making. The activation and deactivation of features in the variability model result in changes in a composition model that abstracts the underlying service composition.

1280169,Eliciting gaps in requirements change,2004,Colette Rolland and Camille Salinesi and Anne Etien,9,Requirements Engineering,1,1-15,Springer-Verlag,We consider requirements change due to system evolution which results from contextual forces such as the decision to standardise practices across subsidiaries of a company. Our experience with the financial branch of the French Renault group is that eliciting change requirements poses its own specific problems. We propose to model change as a set of gaps between the requirements specification of the current and the future system. Our approach is to define a generic typology of gaps to facilitate a precise definition of change requirements. It adopts a goal oriented requirements specification and shows how to customise the generic gap typology to this specific requirements representation formalism.

Heidelberg,Aligning Information Systems (IS) to organization’s strategic business objectives is one of organizations’ top preoccupations. Misalignment is considered as a reason of IT’s failure to improve organizational performance. If strategic alignment is relatively simple to understand. it is not so easy to implement. Our experience showed us that organizations are not really able to systematically evaluate whether there is alignment. mainly because of the lack of documentation on strategic alignment. This paper intends to deal with this issue by proposing an approach to describe organizations’ strategic objectives and its IS. in order to document and analyze strategic alignment. i.e. how the IS contributes to strategic objectives satisfaction. The proposed method. called InStAl (Intentional Strategic Alignment). reuses organization documents as a basis to formalize strategic alignment.

This results in many partial models of the developing system. These models can be inconsistent with each other since they describe the system from different perspectives and reflect the views of the stakeholders involved in their construction. Inconsistent software models can have negative and positive effects in the software development life-cycle.

In this paper we present a framework that supports run-time service discovery. The central characteristic of this framework is the combination of components for monitoring the compliance of service-centric systems with requirements at run-time and components for discovering services at run-time. The framework uses the former components to detect violations of requirements at run-time and uses the specifications of the violated requirements to generate queries for discovering services that could substitute for malfunctioning services. It also uses queries derived from the process specification for service discovery.

1280187,Freedom of religion. apostasy and Islam,2017,Abdullah Saeed,,,,,Routledge,Debate on freedom of religion as a human right takes place not only in the Western world but also in Muslim communities throughout the world. For Muslims concerned for this freedom. one of the major difficulties is the'punishment for apostasy'-death for those who desert Islam. This book argues that the law of apostasy and its punishment by death in Islamic law is untenable in the modern period. Apostasy conflicts with a variety of foundation texts of Islam and with the current ethos of human rights. in particular the freedom to choose one's religion. Demonstrating the early development of the law of apostasy as largely a religio-political tool. the authors show the diversity of opinion among early Muslims on the punishment. highlighting the substantial ambiguities about what constitutes apostasy. the problematic nature of some of the key textual evidence on which the punishment of apostasy is based. and the neglect of a vast amount of clear Qur'anic texts in favour of freedom of religion in the construction of the law of apostasy. Examining the significant challenges the punishment of apostasy faces in the modern period inside and outside Muslim communities-exploring in particular how apostasy and its punishment is dealt with in a multi-religious Muslim majority country.

1280189,Analyzing security requirements as relationships among strategic actors,2002,Eric Yu Lin Liu and John Mylopoulos,,,,,,Security issues for software systems ultimately concern relationships among social actors–stakeholders. users. potential attackers. etc.--and software acting on their behalf. In assessing vulnerabilities and mitigation measures. actors make strategic decisions to achieve desired levels of security while trading off competing requirements such as costs. performance. usability and so on. This paper explores the explicit modeling of relationships among strategic actors in order to elicit. identify and analyze security requirements. In particular. actor dependency analysis helps in the identification of attackers and their potential threats. while actor goal analysis helps to elicit the dynamic decision making process of system players for security issues. Patterns of relationships at various levels of abstraction (eg intentional dependencies among abstract roles) can be studied separately. These patterns can be selectively applied and combined for analyzing specific system configurations. The approach is particularly suitable for new Internet applications where layers of software entities and human roles interact to create complex security challenges. Examples from Peer-to-Peer computing are used to illustrate the proposed framework.,True,VRuRD94AAAAJ:de6HPdfwrHoC,130,ftp://www.cs.toronto.edu/cs/ftp/pub/eric/eric/SREIS02-Sec.pdf,6819615400660702410,/scholar?cites=6819615400660702410,,,ftp://www.cs.toronto.edu/cs/ftp/pub/eric/eric/SREIS02-Sec.pdf,0,0,0

Knowledge Management (KM) does offer the way on how to exploit intellectual capitals in business organizations. However. the KM principles can also be implemented in other types of organization such as the Higher Learning Institutions (HLI). One way to exploit KM is by implementing the KM System (KMS). As we all concern. knowledge is everywhere and how far it has been captured. collaborated and managed systematically especially in public higher learning institutions is unknown.

In the present study. we investigated whether miR-29c functions as a tumor-suppressor miRNA in gastric carcinoma cells. For this purpose. we verified the downregulation of miR-29c in gastric carcinoma tissues. and assessed the biological effect of miR-29c on gastric carcinoma cells. In miR-29c-transfected cells. both proliferation and colony formation ability on soft agar were significantly decreased. Although apoptosis was not induced. BrdU incorporation and the proportion of cells positive for phospho-histone H3 (S10) were significantly decreased in miR-29c-transfected cells. indicating that miR-29c may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. To explain the mechanism of growth suppression by miR-29c. we explored differentially expressed genes (>2-fold) in miR-29c-transfected cells in comparison with negative control transfected cells using microarray. RCC2. PPIC and CDK6 were commonly downregulated in miR-29c-transfected MKN45. MKN7 and MKN74 cells. and all of the genes harbored miR-29c target sequences in the 3’-UTR of their mRNA.

The evolution of the Youjiang basin progressed through two stages. In the Hercynian period. the opening of the Ailaoshan‐Honghe ocean basin gave rise to a number of NW ‐ trending rift belts in the Youjiang area. During this period. deep ‐ water sediments were dominant and the basin was possesed of the characteristics of the rift system of passive continental margins. In the early Indosinian after the Dongwu movement. the circum ‐ Pacific tectonism led to a major change in the configuration and structure of the basin. In the meantime. the Ailaoshan ocean basin began to be subducted towards the northeast. thus causing the basin to be split and expand again. and then the basin developed into the stage of the …,True,fwjc1DYAAAAJ:dgXhHFWAKKUC,66,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-6724.1995.mp8004002.x,18167142468116499575,/scholar?cites=18167142468116499575,,,,0,0,0

Cross-project defect prediction has been the main area of progress by reusing classifiers from other projects. However. existing approaches require some degree of homogeneity (e.g.. a similar distribution of metric values) between the training projects and the target project. Satisfying the homogeneity requirement often requires significant effort (currently a very active area of research). An unsupervised classifier does not require any training data. therefore the heterogeneity challenge is no longer an issue.

Using these three dimensions and their associated attributes. we examine the fix-time for bugs in two large open source projects: Eclipse and Mozilla. using a random forest classifier.Results: We show that we can correctly classify~ 65% of the time the fix-time for bugs in these projects.

1280227,Mining performance regression testing repositories for automated performance analysis,2010,King Chun Foo and Zhen Ming Jiang and Bram Adams and Ahmed E Hassan and Ying Zou and Parminder Flora,,,,32-41,IEEE,Performance regression testing detects performance regressions in a system under load. Such regressions refer to situations where software performance degrades compared to previous releases. although the new version behaves correctly. In current practice. performance analysts must manually analyze performance regression testing data to uncover performance regressions. This process is both time-consuming and error-prone due to the large volume of metrics collected. the absence of formal performance objectives and the subjectivity of individual performance analysts. In this paper. we present an automated approach to detect potential performance regressions in a performance regression test. Our approach compares new test results against correlations pre-computed performance metrics extracted from performance regression testing repositories.

The changes to the clones over time create a clone evolution history. In this work we study late propagation. a specific pattern of clone evolution. In late propagation. one clone in the clone pair is modified. causing the clone pair to become inconsistent. The code segments are then re-synchronized in a later revision. Existing work has established late propagation as a clone evolution pattern. and suggested that the pattern is related to a high number of faults. In this study we examine the characteristics of late propagation in two long-lived software systems using the Simian and CCFinder clone detection tools. We define 8 types of late propagation and compare them to other forms of clone evolution. Our results not only verify that late propagation is more harmful to software systems. but also establish that some specific cases of late …,True,pCYlknMAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,99,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6080794/,4755647237392438955,/scholar?cites=4755647237392438955,,,,0,0,0
1280229,An approach for context-aware service discovery and recommendation,2010,Hua Xiao and Ying Zou and Joanna Ng and Leho Nigul,,,,163-170,IEEE,Given the large amount of existing services and the diversified needs nowadays. it is time-consuming for end-users to find appropriate services. To help end-users obtain their desired services. context-aware systems provide a promising way to automatically search and recommend services using a user's context. However. existing context-aware techniques have limited support for dynamic adaption to newly added context types (e.g.. location. time and activity). Due to the diversity of user's environment. the available context types may change over time. It is challenging to anticipate a complete set of context types while we design a context aware system. In this paper. we propose a context modeling approach which can dynamically handle various context types and values. More specifically. we use ontologies to enhance the meaning of a user's context values and automatically identify the relations among different …,True,pCYlknMAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,89,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5552790/,13728368473724220604,/scholar?cites=13728368473724220604,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ying_Zou3/publication/221587808_An_Approach_for_Context-Aware_Service_Discovery_and_Recommendation/links/02bfe512ee4deaf692000000/An-Approach-for-Context-Aware-Service-Discovery-and-Recommendation.pdf,0,0,0

A series of subject-based laboratory experiments. including an internal replication. tested the effect of inheritance depth on the maintainability of object-oriented software. Subjects were timed performing identical maintenance tasks on object-oriented software with a hierarchy of three levels of inheritance depth and equivalent object-based software with no inheritance.

Heidelberg,This report describes an empirical study comparing three defect detection techniques: a) code reading by stepwise abstraction. b) functional testing using equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis. and c) structural testing using branch coverage. It is a replication of a study that has been carried out at least four times previously over the last 20 years. This study used 47 student subjects to apply the techniques to small C programs in a fractional factorial experimental design. The major findings of the study are: a) that the individual techniques are of broadly similar effectiveness in terms of observing failures and finding faults. b) that the relative effectiveness of the techniques depends on the nature of the program and its faults. c) these techniques are consistently much more effective when used in combination with each other.

To make real progress researchers must address the difficulties caused by the human-intensive nature of software development as well as experimental validity. This paper proposes the use of multi-method empirical research programs. as an alternative to `single-shot' empirical studies. to help address these problems.The multi-method approach is based on the combination of complementary empirical research methods. The intention is that the complementary nature of the research methods compensate for weaknesses inherent in individual methods.

A view less widely held is that experiments should be replicated externally (ie by di erent researchers) to both verify and validate the original results.This paper serves two main functions. First. the need for external replications is established. The role of replication in experimental software engineering is discussed. Without the con rming power of external replications. results in experimental software engineering should only be provisionally accepted. if at all. An extension to the framework for experimentation in software engineering by Basili et al 5] is proposed to di erentiate between the various kinds of internal and external replication and their powers of con rmation and to allow a better appreciation of the context of a piece of empirical work. Second. this paper presents a concrete example of an external replication of an experiment which tested the bene ts to maintenance of using modular code against non-modular (monolithic) code. The results of the original experiment by Korson 32. 33] showed that a modular program could be maintained signi cantly faster than an equivalent monolithic version of the same program under the condition that modularity has been used to implement information hiding which localizes changes required by a modi cation. The results of our replication. however. were strikingly di erent from those of the original and showed no signi cant di erence between the average times taken to maintain modular and monolithic code.

1280248,Uncovering the reality within virtual software teams,2006,Valentine Casey and Ita Richardson,,,,66-72,,To support software development globalisation. organisations are increasingly implementing virtual team strategies. However. these teams have to work within the confines of the factors which distance introduces. thus not always allowing effective coordination. visibility. communication and cooperation to take place. The successful implementation and management of such teams must be done differently to those at single-site locations. To establish what factors significantly affect the implementation of virtual teams. the authors carried out qualitative research in two organisations in Ireland.

1280249,Project management within virtual software teams,2006,Valentine Casey and Ita Richardson,,,,33-42,IEEE,When implementing software development in a global environment. a popular strategy is the establishment of virtual teams. The objective of this paper is to examine the effective project management of this type of team. In the virtual team environment problems arise due to the collaborative nature of software development and the impact distance introduces. Distance specifically impacts coordination. visibility. communication and cooperation within a virtual team. In these circumstances the project management of a virtual team must be carried out in a different manner to that of a team in a single-site location. Results from this research highlighted six specific project management related areas that need to be addressed to facilitate successful virtual team operation.

Despite the significance of Extract Method refactoring towards code quality improvement. there is limited support for the identification of code fragments with distinct functionality that could be extracted into new methods. The goal of our approach is to automatically identify Extract Method refactoring opportunities which are related with the complete computation of a given variable (complete computation slice) and the statements affecting the state of a given object (object state slice).

It is obvious that when a system exhibits a large sensitivity to changes. the corresponding design quality is questionable.

System design using timed automata relies on explicit manipulation of clock variables. A number of automated analyzers for timed automata have been developed. However. timed automata lack composable patterns for high-level system design. Specification languages like Timed Communicating Sequential Process (CSP) and Timed Communicating Object-Z (TCOZ) are well suited for presenting compositional models of complex real-time systems. In this work. we define a set of composable Timed Automata patterns based on hierarchical constructs in time-enriched process algebras. The patterns facilitate the hierarchical design of complex systems using timed automata. They also allow a systematic translation from Timed CSP/TCOZ models to timed automata so that analyzers for timed automata can be used to reason …,True,DVsEyn0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,81,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4586397/,14044091214574439336,/scholar?cites=14044091214574439336,,,https://dro.dur.ac.uk/6248/1/6248.pdf,0,0,0
1280273,Model checking linearizability via refinement,2009,Yang Liu and Wei Chen and Yanhong Liu and Jun Sun,,FM 2009: Formal Methods,,321-337,Springer Berlin/Heidelberg,Linearizability is an important correctness criterion for implementations of concurrent objects. Automatic checking of linearizability is challenging because it requires checking that 1) all executions of concurrent operations be serializable. and 2) the serialized executions be correct with respect to the sequential semantics. This paper describes a new method to automatically check linearizability based on refinement relations from abstract specifications to concrete implementations. Our method avoids the often difficult task of determining linearization points in implementations. but can also take advantage of linearization points if they are given. The method exploits model checking of finite state systems specified as concurrent processes with shared variables. Partial order reduction is used to effectively reduce the search space. The approach is built into a toolset that supports a rich set of concurrent operators …,True,DVsEyn0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,73,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-05089-3_21,9175459472980218696,/scholar?cites=9175459472980218696,,,https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6043&context=sis_research,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,An architectural aspect is a concern that cuts across architecture modularity units and cannot be effectively modularized using the given abstractions of conventional Architecture Description Languages (ADLs). Dealing with crosscutting concerns is not a trivial task since they affect each other and the base architectural decomposition in multiple heterogeneous ways. The lack of ADL support for modularly representing such aspectual heterogeneous influences leads to a number of architectural breakdowns. such as increased maintenance overhead. reduced reuse capability. and architectural erosion over the lifetime of a system. On the other hand. software architects should not be burdened with a plethora of new ADL abstractions directly derived from aspect-oriented implementation techniques.

Zimmermann. and Zeller (SZZ) for identifying bug-introducing changes is at the foundation of several research areas within the software engineering discipline. Despite the foundational role of SZZ. little effort has been made to evaluate its results. Such an evaluation is a challenging task because the ground truth is not readily available. By acknowledging such challenges. we propose a framework to evaluate the results of alternative SZZ implementations. The framework evaluates the following criteria: (1) the earliest bug appearance. (2) the future impact of changes. and (3) the realism of bug introduction. We use the proposed framework to evaluate five SZZ implementations using data from ten open source projects.

A better understanding of what developers search for could help us understand their behaviors and the problems that they meet during the software development process. Unfortunately. we have a limited understanding of what developers frequently search for and of the search tasks that they often find challenging. To address this gap. we collected search queries from 60 developers. surveyed 235 software engineers from more than 21 countries across five continents. In particular. we asked our survey participants to rate the frequency and difficulty of 34 search tasks which are grouped along the following seven dimensions: general search. debugging and bug fixing. programming. third party code reuse. tools. database. and testing.

To improve software quality. developers often allow users to report bugs that they found using a bug tracking system such as Bugzilla. Users would specify among other things. a description of the bug. the component that is affected by the bug. and the severity of the bug. Based on this information. bug triagers would then assign a priority level to the reported bug. As resources are limited. bug reports would be investigated based on their priority levels. This priority assignment process however is a manual one. Could we do better? In this paper. we propose an automated approach based on machine learning that would recommend a priority level based on information available in bug reports. Our approach considers multiple factors. temporal. textual. author. related-report. severity. and product. that potentially affect the priority level of a bug report.

The overall approach makes use of a refinement calculus for timed systems. similar to the refinement calculi for sequential programs. The specification makes use of topologically continuous functions of time to describe both analogue and discrete properties of both the system and its refinements. The basic building block of specifications is a specification statement. similar to Morgan’s specification statement for sequential programs. It gives a clear separation between the specification of the assumptions that the system may make about the environment in which it is to be placed. and the effect the system is guaranteed to achieve if placed in such an environment. The top-level refinement of the system is developed by application of refinement laws that allow design decisions to be made. local state to be introduced. and the decomposition of systems into pipe-lined and/or parallel processes.,True,fRdQiZcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,162,https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/ianh/Papers/mahony92mine.pdf,7626327686780874746,/scholar?cites=7626327686780874746,,,https://staff.itee.uq.edu.au/ianh/Papers/mahony92mine.pdf,0,0,0

However. this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far. only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper. we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications. we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge. ie. simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions.

We use network centrality measures to measure the degree of fragmentation of developer contributions. Fragmentation is determined by the centrality of software modules in the contribution network.

Furthermore. WSNs are characterized by high heterogeneity because there are many different proprietary and non-proprietary solutions. This wide range of technologies has delayed new deployments and integration with existing sensor networks. The current trend. however. is to move away from proprietary and closed standards. to embrace IP-based sensor networks using the emerging standard 6LoWPAN/IPv6. This allows native connectivity between WSN and Internet. enabling smart objects to participate to the Internet of Things (IoT).

Assuming that each process in the parameterized system is finite-state. the abstract variables are limited counters which count. for each local states of a process. the number of processes which currently are in local state s. The counters are saturated at 2. which means that κ(s) = 2 whenever 2 or more processes are at state s. The emphasis of the paper is on the derivation of an adequate and sound set of fairness requirements (both weak and strong) that enable proofs of liveness properties of the abstract system. from which we can safely conclude a corresponding liveness property of the original parameterized system.

Our hybrid approach takes the best of both the traditional methods of live migration - pre and post-copy. In pre-copy. the cpu state and memory is transferred before spawning the VM on destination host whereas the latter is exactly opposite and spawns the VM on destination right after transferring processor state. In our approach. in addition to processor state. we bundle a lot of useful state information. This includes devices and frequently accessed pages of the VM. aka the working set. This drastically reduces the number of page faults over network while we actively transfer memory.

Advances in this area are impeded by the lack of a suitable annotated dataset. We introduce a Hindi-English (Hi-En) code-mixed dataset for sentiment analysis and perform empirical analysis comparing the suitability and performance of various state-of-the-art SA methods in social media. In this paper. we introduce learning sub-word level representations in our LSTM (Subword-LSTM) architecture instead of character-level or word-level representations. This linguistic prior in our architecture enables us to learn the information about sentiment value of important morphemes. This also seems to work well in highly noisy text containing misspellings as shown in our experiments which is demonstrated in morpheme-level feature maps learned by our model. Also. we hypothesize that encoding this linguistic prior in the Subword-LSTM architecture leads to the superior performance.

This paradigm shift requires the extension of current standalone configuration technology with capabilities of knowledge sharing and distributed problem solving.

OWL-S (Ontology Web Language for Services) exploits the semantic description power of OWL to build an ontology language for services. It therefore becomes a candidate for an inter lingua. In this paper. we propose an integration framework for business processes. which is …,True,Bzk62SMAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,85,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X0600118X,2333096290786978875,/scholar?cites=2333096290786978875,,,http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1431&context=infopapers,0,0,0

The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security. anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions. and therefore it creates interesting research areas. especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations. In this research. we have conducted a systematic mapping study with the goal of collecting all relevant research on Blockchain technology. Our objective is to understand the current research topics. challenges and future directions regarding Blockchain technology from the technical perspective. We have extracted 41 primary papers from scientific databases. The results show that focus in over 80% of the papers is on Bitcoin system and less than 20% deals with other Blockchain applications including e.g. smart contracts and licensing. The majority of research is focusing on revealing and improving limitations of Blockchain from privacy and security perspectives. but many of the proposed solutions lack concrete evaluation on their effectiveness. Many other Blockchain scalability related challenges including throughput and latency have been left unstudied.

Heidelberg,Existing CASE tools are often rigid and do not support the users' native methodologies. To alleviate this. more flexible and customisable tools called CASE shells are emerging. However. the customisation of those tools is still cumbersome and error-prone. and demands several configuration files that follow a rigid syntax of some metamodelling language(s). In order to make the customisation easier. we propose a graphical metamodelling editor. MetaEdit. with which the conceptual structures of the user methodology can be modelled easily using an easy-to-grasp graphical notation. With MetaEdit. methodology models can be constructed with less effort and the configuration files for the CASE shell can be created (semi)automatically. The tool is flexible i.e. its symbols and metamodel are user-definable. In consequence it can be used as a simple CASE shell.

Since there are so many variations of the attributes associated with global software projects a large amount of new terms has been introduced. The diversity in sourcing jargon however has caused difficulties in determining which term to use in which situation. and thus causing further obstacles to searching and finding relevant research during e.g. systematic literature reviews. The inability of judging the applicability of the research in an industrial context is another important implication on the transferability of research into practice. Thus the need for accurate terminology and definitions for different global sourcing situations emerges as a way for the community to build upon each other’s work and hence making progress more quickly.

We believe that significant progress in system architecture. system understanding. object technology. and net-centric computing make it possible to economically evolve software systems to a state in which they exhibit greater functionality and maintainability. In particular. interface technology. wrapping technology. and network technology are opening many opportunities to leverage existing software assets instead of scrapping them and starting over. But these promising technologies cannot be applied in a vacuum or without management understanding and control. There must be a framework in which to motivate the organization to understand its business opportunities. its application systems. and its road to an improved target system.

We formulate 15 hypotheses relating to the nature of performance variations in IaaS systems. to the factors of influence of performance variations. and how to compare different instance types. In a second step. we conduct extensive real-life experimentation on four cloud providers to empirically validate those hypotheses. We show that there are substantial differences between providers.

However. if things go wrong. a deeper analysis of process performance becomes necessary. Business analysts want to learn about the factors that influence the performance of business processes and most often contribute to the violation of KPI target values. and how they relate to each other. We provide a framework for performance monitoring and analysis of WS-BPEL processes. which consolidates process events and Quality of Service measurements. The framework uses machine learning techniques in order to construct tree structures. which represent the dependencies of a KPI on process and QoS metrics.

These devices do not simply act as sensors. but feature computational. storage. and networking resources. These resources are close to the edge of the network. and it is a promising approach to exploit them in order to execute IoT services. This concept is known as fog computing. Despite existing theoretical foundations. the adoption of fog computing is still at its very beginning. Especially. there is a lack of approaches for the leasing and releasing of resources. To resolve this shortcoming. we present a conceptual framework for fog resource provisioning.

Quality of Service represents an important issue which is often considered when selecting and composing services. For receiving up-to-date information. non-functional properties such as response time or availability can be continuously monitored using server-or clientside approaches. However. both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. In this paper. we present a framework that combines the advantages of client-and server-side QoS monitoring. It builds on event processing to inform interested subscribers of current QoS values and possible violations of Service Level Agreements. These events can trigger adaptive behavior such as hosting new service instances if the QoS is not as desired.

Previous work has established runtime adaptation of compositions as a promising tool to achieve SLA conformance. However. to get a realistic and complete view of the decision process of service providers. the costs of adaptation need to be taken into account. In this paper. we formalize the problem of finding the optimal set of adaptations. which minimizes the total costs arising from SLA violations and the adaptations to prevent them.

Berlin. Heidelberg,SLAs are contractually binding agreements between service providers and consumers. mandating concrete numerical target values which the service needs to achieve. For service providers. it is essential to prevent SLA violations as much as possible to enhance customer satisfaction and avoid penalty payments. Therefore. it is desirable for providers to predict possible violations before they happen. while it is still possible to set counteractive measures. We propose an approach for predicting SLA violations at runtime. which uses measured and estimated facts (instance data of the composition or QoS of used services) as input for a prediction model. The prediction model is based on machine learning regression techniques. and trained using historical process instances.

In process centered environments. change management can be facilitated by software-process programming. which formalizes the representation of software products and processes using software-process programming languages (SPPLs). To fully realize this goal SPPLs should include constructs that specifically address the problems of change management. These problems include lack of representation of inter-object relationships. weak semantics for inter-object relationships. visibility of implementations. lack of formal representation of software processes. and reliance on programmers to manage change manually.APPL/A is a prototype SPPL that addresses these problems.

Nevertheless. the failure to separate concerns effectively has been identified as a continuing cause of the ongoing software crisis. This failure arises in part because most programming and modeling formalisms enforce a dominant decomposition that allows only a few concerns to be separated. whereas software in reality is subject to multiple simultaneous. overlapping. and crosscutting concerns. Several approaches to"" advanced separation of concerns"" have been proposed. including subject-oriented programming. aspect-oriented programming. and Hyperspaces.

Among the important issue for process languages are semantic richness. ease of use. appropriate abstractions. process composability. visualization. and support for multiple paradigms. The need to balance semantic richness with ease of use is particularly critical. JIL addresses these issues in a number of innovative ways. It models processes in terms of steps with a rich variety of semantic attributes. The JIL control model combines proactive and reactive control. conditional control. and more simple means of control-flow modeling via step composition and execution constraints. JIL facilitates ease of use through semantic factoring. the accommodation of incomplete step specifications. the fostering of simple sub-languages. and the ability to support visualizations.

A decision to address a dependability concern in a particular manner can make it difficult or impossible to address other concerns in software. Proper attention to balancing key dependability and other concerns in the early phases of development can help developers better manage product risks through early identification and resolution of conflicts and undesirable emergent behaviours that arise as a result of interactions across behaviours that address different concerns.

We present a new approach for structuring the optimization phase of a compiler.

In response. creative adversaries have begun circumventing these defenses by exploiting programming errors to manipulate pointers to virtual tables. or vtables. of C++ objects. These attacks can hijack program control flow whenever a virtual method of a corrupted object is called. potentially allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the underlying system. In this paper we present SAFEDISPATCH. a novel defense to prevent such vtable hijacking by statically analyzing C++ programs and inserting sufficient runtime checks to ensure that control flow at virtual method call sites cannot be arbitrarily influenced by an attacker.

1280518,An enumerative approach for analyzing time Petri nets,1983,Bernard Berthomieu and Miguel Menasche,,,,,,This paper is concerned with specifying and proving correct systems in which time appears as a parameter. We model such systems via Merlin's Time Petri Nets. An enumerative analysis technique is introduced for these nets based on the computation of a set of state classes and a reachability relation on the set. State classes are de ned in the text and an algorithm is provided for their enumeration. This enumerative approach allows us to derive a nite representation of their behavior for a large family of Time Petri Nets.

To advance the field of self-adaptive and self-managing systems further and to leverage the benefits of self-adaptation. we need to develop methods and tools to assess and possibly certify adaptation properties of self-adaptive systems. not only at design time but also. and especially. at run-time. In this paper we propose a framework for evaluating quality-driven self-adaptive software systems. Our framework is based on a survey of self-adaptive system papers and a set of adaptation properties derived from control theory properties. We also establish a mapping between these properties and software quality attributes. Thus. corresponding software quality metrics can then be used to assess adaptation properties.,True,wwofzdYAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,164,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1988008.1988020,9298935245552121213,/scholar?cites=9298935245552121213,,,https://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/57/83/37/PDF/seams-2011.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,In this paper. we present the Java Aspect Components (JAC) framework for building aspect‐oriented distributed applications in Java. This paper describes the aspect‐oriented programming model and the architectural details of the framework implementation. The framework enables extension of application semantics for handling well‐separated concerns. This is achieved with a software entity called an aspect component (AC). ACs provide distributed pointcuts. dynamic wrappers and metamodel annotations. Distributed pointcuts are a key feature of our framework. They enable the definition of crosscutting structures that do not need to be located on a single host. ACs are dynamic. They can be added. removed. and controlled at runtime.

This DSPL. named CAPucine for Context-Aware Service-Oriented Product Line is based on two different processes for product derivation. The first process uses assets that represent features of the product family. The assets. represented as models. get composed and transformed in order to generate the product. The second process relates to dynamic adaptation. This process introduces context-aware assets that operate at runtime. These context-aware assets contain three kinds of data: the context when the assets can be modified. the place where the assets must be applied and the change that must be performed. The realization of these context-aware assets combines two runtime platforms. On the one hand. COSMOS is a contextaware framework connected to the environment by the use of sensors. On the other hand FraSCAti is a Service Component Architecture (SCA) platform with dynamic properties that enables to bind and unbind components at runtime. CAPucine allows designing and processing context-aware applications based on an SCA platform which is dynamic. introspectable. and reconfigurable in accordance with the context environment.,True,wwofzdYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,123,https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00425586/,7800815311776004546,/scholar?cites=7800815311776004546,,,https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00425586/file/splc37-parra.pdf,0,0,0

To reach consensus and unification of existing metamodels. metamodel-driven software language engineering can be applied. This paper illustrates an application of software language engineering in the agent-oriented software engineering research domain.

Heidelberg,From a software engineering point of view. the agent paradigm has shown its potential for modelling in different domains. However. moving from agent models to implementation is not fully addressed by most agent-oriented methodologies in a systematic way.

Smart Grids are one of the answers: intelligent energy grids which retrieve data about the environment through extensive sensor networks and react accordingly to optimize resource consumption. In order to do this. the Smart Grids need to understand the existing relationship between energy demand and a set of relevant climatic variables. All smart “systems”(buildings. cities. homes. consumers. etc.) have the potential to employ their intelligence for self-adaptation to climate conditions. After introducing the Smart World. a global framework for the collaboration of these smart systems. this paper presents the relationship found at experimental level between a range of relevant weather variables and electric power demand patterns. presenting a case study using an agent-based system. and emphasizing the need to consider this relationship in certain Smart World (and specifically Smart Grid and microgrid) applications.

Surely not all papers should be evaluated according to the same criteria.

This dependency magnifies the far-reaching consequences of system damage from attacks and intrusions. Yet no amount of security can guarantee that systems will not be penetrated. Incorporating survivability capabilities into an organizations systems can mitigate the risks. Survivability is the capability of a system to fulfill its mission in a timely manner despite intrusions. failures. or accidents. The three tenets of survivability are 1. resistance to intrusions. 2. recognition of intrusion effects. and 3. recovery of services despite successful intrusions. The survivability of existing or planned systems can be analyzed at the level of system architectures or requirements. This report describes the Survivable Network Analysis SNA method developed at the SEIs CERT Coordination Center. The four-step SNA method guides stakeholders through an analysis process intended to improve system survivability when a system is threatened. The method focuses on preservation of essential system services that support the organizational mission. SNA findings are summarized in a Survivability Map that enumerates current and recommended architectural strategies.

Ltd.,Finding bugs due to race conditions in multi‐threaded programs is difficult. mainly because there are many possible interleavings. any of which may contain a fault. In  this  work  we present a methodology for testing multi‐threaded programs which has minimal impact on the user and is likely to find interleaving bugs. Our method reruns existing tests in order to detect synchronization faults. We find that a single test executed a number of times in a controlled environment may be as effective in finding synchronization faults as many different tests. A great deal of resources are saved since tests are very expensive to write and maintain. We observe that simply rerunning tests. without ensuring in some way that the interleaving will change. yields almost no benefits. We implement the methodology in our test generation tool—ConTest.

The design has focused on efficiently supporting the simulation of multiprocessors. analyzing complex memory hierarchies and running large binaries with a mixture of system level and user level code. A software caching mechanism (the Simulator Translation Cache. STC) improves the performance of interpreted memory operations by reducing the number of calls to complex memory simulation code. Major data structures are allocated lazily to reduce the size of the simulator process. A well defined internal interface to generic memory simulation simplifies user extensions.

As Figure 1 shows. designers begin by developing performance models of the target architecture. followed by actual logic design—also called Register Transfer Language. or RTL. Circuit designers convert the logic specification into circuits. and layout engineers eventually position the circuits on the processor floor plan. For very complex designs. such a design process can take as long as seven years. Of course. the process involves close interactions between the steps. The performance model. in particular. is refined as logic. and circuit designers feed back better timing estimates for different hardware components of the target architecture. Thus. the performance model’s fidelity to the target architecture is often key to the success of the architecture itself. Additionally. the performance model must run at least faster than RTL; otherwise. developers could obtain performance estimates from the logic blocks themselves. Our experience shows that performance models usually run several orders of magnitude faster than RTL.,True,DiHIC5YAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,67,https://www.academia.edu/download/39218325/54bf0bbd0cf28ce68e6b0cd0.pdf,1269222905115434656,/scholar?cites=1269222905115434656,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39218325/54bf0bbd0cf28ce68e6b0cd0.pdf,0,0,0

Specifically. we investigate the applicability of cross-company (CC) data for building localized defect predictors using static code features. Firstly. we analyze the conditions. where CC data can be used as is. These conditions turn out to be quite few. Then we apply principles of analogy-based learning (i.e. nearest neighbor (NN) filtering) to CC data. in order to fine tune these models for localization. We compare the performance of these models with that of defect predictors learned from within-company (WC) data.

Heidelberg,Business-driven development favors the construction of process models at different abstraction levels and by different people. As a consequence. there is a demand for consolidating different versions of process models by detecting and resolving differences. Existing approaches rely on the existence of a change log which logs the changes when changing a process model.

1280608,Rule-based specification of behavioral consistency based on the UML meta-model,2001,Gregor Engels and Reiko Heckel and Jochen Malte Küster,,,,272-286,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,Object-oriented modeling favors the modeling of object behavior from different viewpoints and at different levels of abstraction. This gives rise to consistency problems between overlapping or semantically related submodels. The absence of a formal semantics for the UML and the numerous ways of employing the language within the development process lead to a number of different consistency notions. Therefore. general meta-level techniques are required for specifying. analyzing. and communicating consistency constraints. In this paper. we discuss the issue of consistency of behavioral models in the UML and present techniques for specifying and analyzing consistency. Using meta-model rules we transform elements of UML models into a semantic domain. Then. consistency constraints can by specified and validated using the language and the tools of the semantic domain.

A model transformation automates the translation of models between a source and a target language. In order to reason about the correctness of the translation it is important to be able to analyse model transformations. A model transformation specification can be considered as a special kind of model and as such it can be subject to existing model analysis techniques. In this paper we present a systematic method of representing declarative model transformations in a formalism called Alloy. We demonstrate how the Alloy Analyzer can be used to conduct fully automated analysis of a model transformation specification represented in Alloy. The presented approach is explained with the help of an example model transformation in business processes.,True,rQwUZewAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,164,https://www.academia.edu/download/30785751/modevva07.pdf#page=53,9792032419340779075,/scholar?cites=9792032419340779075,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30785751/modevva07.pdf#page=53,0,0,0

Although a number of approaches for specifying model transformations exist. none of them focusses on systematically validating model transformations with respect to termination and confluence. Termination and confluence ensure that a model transformation always produces a unique result. Also called functionality. these properties are important requirements for practical applications of model transformations. In this paper. we introduce our approach to model transformation.

Berlin. Heidelberg,In enterprise application development and other software construction projects. a critical success factor is to make sound architectural decisions. Text templates and tool support for capturing architectural decisions exist. but have failed to reach broad adoption so far. One of the inhibitors we perceived on large-scale industry projects is that architectural decision capturing is regarded as a retrospective and therefore unwelcome documentation task which does not provide any benefit during the original design work. A major problem of such a retrospective approach is that the decision rationale is not available to decision makers when they identify. make. and enforce decisions. Often a large. possibly distributed. community of decision makers is involved in these three steps.

Despite several advantages of meta modeling such as ease of use. the meta modeling approach has one disadvantage: it is not constructive. i.e.. it does not offer a direct means of generating instances of the language. This disadvantage poses a severe limitation for certain applications. For example. when developing model transformations. it is desirable to have enough valid instance models available for large-scale testing. Producing such a large set by hand is tedious. In the related problem of compiler testing. a string grammar together with a simple generation algorithm is typically used to produce words of the language automatically.

1280618,Measuring coupling in aspect-oriented systems,2004,Jianjun Zhao,,10th International Software Metrics Symposium (Metrics 04),,,,Coupling is an internal software attribute that can be used to indicate the degree of interdependence among the components of a software system. Coupling is thought to be a desirable goal in software construction. leading to better values for external attributes such as maintainability. reusability. and reliability. Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) is a new technique to support separation of concerns in software development. In aspect-oriented (AO) systems. the basic components are aspects or classes. which consist of attributes (aspect or class instance variables) and those modules such as advice. intertype declarations. pointcuts. and methods. Thus. in AO systems. the coupling is mainly about the degree of interdependence among aspects and/or classes. To test this hypothesis. good coupling measures for AO systems are needed. In this paper. we propose a coupling measure suite for assessing the coupling in aspect-oriented systems. We first present a coupling framework for AO systems which specially designed to count the dependencies between aspects and classes in the systems. Based on this framework. we formally define various coupling measures in terms of different types of dependencies between aspects and classes.

In addition. the strength of coupling measured between modules in software is often used as a predictor of external software quality attributes such as changeability. ripple effects of changes and fault-proneness. This paper presents a new set of coupling measures for Object-Oriented (OO) software systems measuring conceptual coupling of classes. Conceptual coupling is based on measuring the degree to which the identifiers and comments from different classes relate to each other.

There is a need in science and industry for recognizing these patterns. We present a new method for discovering design patterns in the source code. This method provides a precise specification of how the patterns work by describing basic structural information like inheritance. composition. aggregation and association. and as an indispensable part. by defining call delegation. object creation and operation overriding. We introduce a new XML-based language. the Design Pattern Markup Language (DPML). which provides an easy way for the users to modify pattern descriptions to suit their needs. or even to define their own patterns or just classes in certain relations they wish to find. We tested our method on four open-source systems. and found it effective in discovering design pattern instances.,True,SbDnsF0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,161,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1235436/,10822501004520340078,/scholar?cites=10822501004520340078,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.120.3242&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Maintainability is an important characteristic defined in the ISO/IEC 9126 standard. owing to its direct impact on development costs. Although the standard provides definitions for the quality characteristics. it does not define how they should be computed. Not being tangible notions. these characteristics are hardly expected to be representable by a single number. Existing quality models do not deal with ambiguity coming from subjective interpretations of characteristics. which depend on experience. knowledge. and even intuition of experts.

Most of the related research papers tackle the question of finding code clones in one particular version of the software only. leaving the dynamic behavior of the clones out of consideration. Eliminating these clones in large software systems often seems absolutely hopeless. as there might exist several thousands of them. Alternatively. tracking the evolution of individual clones can be used to identify those occurrences that could really cause problems in the future versions.

Thus their correct application in a system's design may significantly improve its internal quality attributes such as reusability and maintainability. In software maintenance the existence of up-to-date documentation is crucial. so the discovery of as yet unknown design pattern instances can help improve the documentation. Hence a reliable design pattern recognition system is very desirable. However. simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description.

It is based on the analysis of latent topics embedded in comments and identifiers in source code. The measure. named as maximal weighted entropy. utilizes the latent Dirichlet allocation technique and information entropy measures to quantitatively evaluate the cohesion of classes in software.

Nevertheless. there are still major problems to overcome in order to attract a broad number of software designers and developers to the usage of graph grammars and graph rewrite systems.

Nevertheless. their symbiosis in the form of graph rewriting systems or graph grammars are not yet popular among software engineers.

Most of the well-known CASE tools support reverse engineering in some way. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has emerged as the de facto standard for graphically representing the design of object-oriented software systems. However. there does not yet exist a standard scheme for representing the reverse-engineered models of these systems.

1280645,Rigorous object oriented software development,2001,Albert Zündorf,,,,,,During the last two decades. the object oriented paradigm has improved the software development practice. massively. with respect to software quality. developers’ productivity. and manageable project size and complexity. The first contribution is the concept of a class as an encapsulation of data fields and corresponding operations. This encapsulation allows the localization of certain system functionality. Different kinds of class relationships allow the combination of classes to system architectures. This enables the modeling of system structures at a higher level of abstraction. Object oriented component and connector architectures build up flexible systems. easily adaptable for changing requirements. Object oriented CORBA [Emm00] technology provides mechanisms for distributed applications.As classes allow to organize complex system structures. objects allow to organize complex runtime information. Objects allow to localize certain pieces of information. Different kinds of object relations allow the combination of objects to complex object structures. There are many examples how objects and object relations allow to tackle complex functionality and facilitate the building of intelligent behavior. The design patterns proposed by Gamma et al.[GHJV95] intensively rely on well-organized object structures and the concept of delegation. Certain tasks are forwarded to neighbor objects and thus. changing the current object setting yields behavior changes. This allows to build flexible applications with relatively simple source code.

1280646,CoObRA-a small step for development tools to collaborative environments,2004,Christian Schneider and Albert Zündorf and Jörg Niere,,Workshop on Directions in Software Engineering Environments,,,,Working on large software projects commonly requires software development in teams. which requires a tight interaction within the development team. Usually each developer is responsible for a certain part of the whole system. Therefore. it is necessary to let developers work independently without disturbing their teammates as well as allowing them to share their results with their teammates at a certain time and to integrate the developed software parts. Common practice is to use CASE-tools to support large software projects and a Software Configuration Management (SCM) system that supports team coordination. Popular SCM systems are usually based upon text files and fail in versioning binary files or object-oriented structures on a fine-grained level. as usually produced by CASE-tools. On the other hand. current CASE-tools insufficiently support versioning and team coordination. CoObRA is a framework that offers undo/redo-. persistency-. multi-user-support and version control techniques for applications based on object-oriented data models in general. The major advantage is that it provides an easy-to-use mechanism requiring very low integration costs.

Trust conveys a vast number of meanings. and is deeply dependent upon context. The literature on engineering trust into e-commerce systems reflects these ambiguous meanings; there are a large number of articles. but there is as yet no clear theoretical framework for the investigation of trust in e-commerce. E-commerce. however. is predicated on trust; indeed. any e-commerce vendor that fails to establish a trusting relationship with their customers is doomed. There is a very clear need for specific guidance on e-commerce system attributes and business operations that will effectively promote consumer trust. To address this need. we have conducted a meta-study of the empirical literature on trust in e-commerce systems.

Hence to progress multiple experiments must be undertaken per hypothesis and the subsequent results effectively combined to produce a single reliable conclusion. Since results are quantitative in nature. a quantitative conclusion would be the optimal solution. Other disciplines use meta-analytic techniques to achieve this result. The treatise of this paper is: can meta-analysis be successfully applied to current software engineering experiments? The question is investigated by examining a series of experiments. which themselves to investigate — which defect-detection technique is best?

The results of the original experiment by Korson 32. 33] showed that a modular program could be maintained signi cantly faster than an equivalent monolithic version of the same program under the condition that modularity has been used to implement information hiding which localizes changes required by a modi cation. The results of our replication. however. were strikingly di erent from those of the original and showed no signi cant di erence between the average times taken to maintain modular and monolithic code.

This first impression is influential enough to later affect their opinions of a site's usability and trustworthiness. In this paper. we demonstrate a means to predict the initial impression of aesthetics based on perceptual models of a website's colorfulness and visual complexity. In an online study. we collected ratings of colorfulness. visual complexity. and visual appeal of a set of 450 websites from 548 volunteers. Based on these data. we developed computational models that accurately measure the perceived visual complexity and colorfulness of website screenshots. In combination with demographic variables such as a user's education level and age. these models explain approximately half of the variance in the ratings of aesthetic appeal given after viewing a website for 500ms only.,True,mDNhPjAAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC,272,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2470654.2481281,15131534739999173103,/scholar?cites=15131534739999173103,,,https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12561368/Predicting%20Users%20First%20Impressions.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This paper presents a new approach to GUI testing using computer vision for testers to automate their tasks. Testers can write a visual test script that uses images to specify which GUI components to interact with and what visual feedback to be observed. Testers can also generate visual test scripts by demonstration. By recording both input events and screen images. it is possible to extract the images of components interacted with and the visual feedback seen by the demonstrator. and generate a visual test script automatically. We show that a variety of GUI behavior can be tested using this approach.

We demonstrate the usefulness of common image search metrics applied on images captured with a camera-equipped mobile device to find matching images on the World Wide Web or other general-purpose databases. Searching the entire Web can be computationally overwhelming. so we devise a hybrid image-and-keyword searching technique. First. image-search is performed over images and links to their source Web pages in a database that indexes only a small fraction of the Web. Then. relevant keywords on these Web pages are automatically identified and submitted to an existing text-based search engine (e.g. Google) that indexes a much larger portion of the Web.

Text is pervasively used to label objects. colors carry special significance. and items can easily become lost in surroundings that cannot be quickly scanned. Many tools seek to help blind people solve these problems by enabling them to query for additional information. such as color or text shown on the object. In this paper we argue that many useful problems may be better solved by directly modeling them as search problems. and present a solution called VizWiz::LocateIt that directly supports this type of interaction.

In this article. we show how this can be achieved by high-level Petri nets—namely. the so-called NR/T-nets (Nested-Relation/Transition Nets). In NR/T-nets. the structural part is modeled by nested relations. and the behavioral part is modeled by a novel Petri net formalism. Each place of a net represents a nested relation scheme. and the marking of each place is given as a nested relation of the respective type. Insert and delete operations in a nested relational database (NF2-database) are expressed by transitions in a net. These operations may operate not only on whole tuples of a given relation. but also on “subtuples”  of existing tuples.

Software Eng.,12,1253-1269,,Requirements modeling depends on having available the knowledge of what should be modeled. Acquiring. or eliciting. this knowledge is recognized to be a hard problem. and different suggestions have been made to address it. In this paper we examine one such approach—viewpoint resolution. It is based on the tact that software requirements can and should be elicited from different viewpoints. and that examination of the differences resulting from them can be used as a way of assisting in the early validation of requirements. Our research proposes a language for expressing views from different viewpoints and a set of analogy heuristics to perform a syntacticly oriented analysis of views. This analysis of views is capable of differentiating between missing information and conflicting information. thus providing support for viewpoint resolution.

1280726,An Integrated Formal Model of Scenarios Based on Statecharts,1995,Martin Glinz,,,,254-271,Springer Berlin-Heidelberg,State automata are an attractive means for formally representing scenarios. Scenarios describe how users interact with a system. However. the current approaches treat every scenario as a separate entity.This paper introduces a statechart-based model that allows the formal composition of all scenarios of a system into an integrated. consistent model of external system behavior. The scenarios remain visible as building blocks in the model. The meaning of the integrated model is derived from the meanings of the constituent scenarios and from the semantics of the composition rules.The paper defines the composition rules and shows their application. The capabilities for analyzing and verifying the model are demonstrated. An extension of the scenario model to a general system model is sketched.,True,FpBbJW8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,196,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-60406-5_19.pdf,12970077992602024895,/scholar?cites=12970077992602024895,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.49.1151&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1280729,Rethinking the Notion of Non-Functional Requirements,2005,Martin Glinz,2,"Third World Congress for Software Quality, Munich, Germany",,55-64,,Requirements standards and textbooks typically classify requirements into functional requirements on the one hand and attributes or non-functional requirements on the other hand. In this classification. requirements given in terms of required operations and/or data are considered to be functional. while performance requirements and quality requirements (such as requirements about security. reliability. maintainability. etc.) are classified as nonfunctional.In this paper. we present arguments why this notion of non-functional requirements is flawed and present a new classification of requirements which is based on four facets: kind (eg function. performance. or constraint). representation (eg operational. quantitative or qualitative). satisfaction (hard or soft). and role (eg prescriptive or assumptive). We define the facets. discuss typical combinations of facets and argue why such a faceted classification of requirements is better than the traditional notion of functional and non-functional requirements.,True,FpBbJW8AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,143,http://www.ptidej.net/SULcZ/PdbhZ/OpNKZ/QMjkZ/teaching/log3410/fall11/Lectures/Article_5.pdf,13653957393476232042,/scholar?cites=13653957393476232042,,,http://www.ptidej.net/SULcZ/PdbhZ/OpNKZ/QMjkZ/teaching/log3410/fall11/Lectures/Article_5.pdf,0,0,0
1280730,A Scenario-Based Approach to Validating and Testing Software Systems Using Statecharts,1999,Johannes Ryser and Martin Glinz,,12th International Conference on Software and Systems Engineering and their Applications,,,,Scenarios (Use cases) are used to describe the functionality and behavior of a (software) system in a user-centered perspective. As scenarios form a kind of abstract level test cases for the system under development. the idea to use them to derive test cases for system test is quite intriguing. Yet in practice scenarios from the analysis phase are seldom used to create concrete system test cases. In this paper we present a procedure to create scenarios in the analysis phase and use those scenarios in system test to systematically determine test cases. This is done by formalization of scenarios into statecharts. annotation of statecharts with helpful information for test case creation/generation and by path traversal in the statecharts to determine concrete test cases.,True,FpBbJW8AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,109,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22.10&rep=rep1&type=pdf,7235539881162000037,/scholar?cites=7235539881162000037,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22.10&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1280731,A Classification of Stereotypes for Object-Oriented Modeling Languages,1999,Stefan Berner and Martin Glinz and Stefan Joos,,,,747-747,Springer Berlin-Heidelberg,The Unified Modeling Language UML and the Open Modeling Language both have introduced stereotypes as a new means for user-defined extensions of a given base language. Stereotypes are a very powerful feature. They allow modifications ranging from slight notational changes up to the redefinition of the base language. However. the power of stereotypes entails risk. Badly designed stereotypes can do harm to a modeling language. In order to exploit the benefits of stereotypes and to avoid their risks. a better understanding of the nature and the properties of stereotypes is necessary.In this paper. we define a framework that classifies stereotypes according to their expressive power. We identify specific properties and typical applications for stereotypes in each of our four categories and illustrate them with examples. For each category. we discuss strengths and weaknesses of stereotypes and …,True,FpBbJW8AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,103,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46852-8_18,1777627299568676404,/scholar?cites=1777627299568676404,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.28.506&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0
1280732,Improving the Quality of Requirements with Scenarios,2000,Martin Glinz,,"Second World Congress on Software Quality, Yokohama, Japan",,55-60,,The classical notion of requirements quality is problematic in practice. Hence the importance of some qualities. in particular completeness and unambiguity. has to be rethought. Scenarios. the description of requirements as sequences of interactions. prove to be a key concept for writing requirements specifications that are oriented towards such a modified set of qualities.In this paper. the potential of scenarios for improving the quality of requirements is discussed. Furthermore. a concept for systematically representing both single scenarios and the structure and relationships in a set of scenarios is presented. Using an example. the positive impact of this style of representation on the quality of the requirements is demonstrated.,True,FpBbJW8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,100,https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/rerg/amadeus/publications/papers/2WCSQ.pdf,581433803402277029,/scholar?cites=581433803402277029,,,https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/rerg/amadeus/publications/papers/2WCSQ.pdf,0,0,0

In order to cope with this challenge effectively. the applications need to adapt to these changes dynamically. CASA (Contract-based Adaptive Software Architecture) provides a framework for enabling dynamic adaptation of applications. in response to changes in their execution environment.

Existing approaches either do not scale to large code bases or are not robust against minor code modifications. In this paper. we present an efficient algorithm for identifying similar subtrees and apply it to tree representations of source code. Our algorithm is based on a novel characterization of subtrees with numerical vectors in the Euclidean space R n middot and an efficient algorithm to cluster these vectors w.r.t. the Euclidean distance metric. Subtrees with vectors in one cluster are considered similar. We have implemented our tree similarity algorithm as a clone detection tool called DECKARD and evaluated it on large code bases written in C and Java including the Linux kernel and JDK.

1280737,Scalable detection of semantic clones,2008,Mark Gabel and Lingxiao Jiang and Zhendong Su,,,,,IEEE,Several techniques have been developed for identifying similar code fragments in programs. These similar fragments. referred to as code clones. can be used to identify redundant code. locate bugs. or gain insight into program design. Existing scalable approaches to clone detection are limited to finding program fragments that are similar only in their contiguous syntax. Other. semantics-based approaches are more resilient to differences in syntax. such as reordered statements. related statements interleaved with other unrelated statements. or the use of semantically equivalent control structures. However. none of these techniques have scaled to real world code bases. These approaches capture semantic information from Program Dependence Graphs (PDGs). program representations that encode data and control dependencies between statements and predicates.

1280738,Context-based detection of clone-related bugs,2007,Lingxiao Jiang and Zhendong Su and Edwin Chiu,,,,,ACM,Studies show that programs contain much similar code. commonly known as clones. One of the main reasons for introducing clones is programmers' tendency to copy and paste code to quickly duplicate functionality. We commonly believe that clones can make programs difficult to maintain and introduce subtle bugs. Although much research has proposed techniques for detecting and removing clones to improve software maintainability. little has considered how to detect latent bugs introduced by clones. In this paper. we introduce a general notion of context-based inconsistencies among clones and develop an efficient algorithm to detect such inconsistencies for locating bugs. We have implemented our algorithm and evaluated it on large open source projects including the latest versions of the Linux kernel and Eclipse.

1280742,Context-aware statistical debugging: from bug predictors to faulty control flow paths,2007,Lingxiao Jiang and Zhendong Su,,,,,ACM,Effective bug localization is important for realizing automated debugging. One attractive approach is to apply statistical techniques on a collection of evaluation profiles of program properties to help localize bugs. Previous research has proposed various specialized techniques to isolate certain program predicates as bug predictors. However. because many bugs may not be directly associated with these predicates. these techniques are often ineffective in localizing bugs. Relevant control flow paths that may contain bug locations are more informative than stand-alone predicates for discovering and understanding bugs. In this paper. we propose an approach to automatically generate such faulty control flow paths that link many bug predictors together for revealing bugs.

In order to understand defects better. industry practitioners often categorize bugs into various types. One common kind of categorization is the IBM's Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). ODC proposes various orthogonal classification of defects based on much information about the defects. such as the symptoms and semantics of the defects. the root cause analysis of the defects. and many more. With these category labels. developers can better perform post-mortem analysis to find out what the common characteristics of the defects that plague a particular software project are.

However. for a cloud service provider (CSP) to offer such services. several research problems still need to be addressed. In previous work. we have introduced a platform. called network function center (NFC). to study research issues related to virtualized network functions (VNFs). In an NFC. we assume VNFs to be implemented on virtual machines that can be deployed in any server in the CSP network. We have proposed a resource allocation algorithm for VNFs based on genetic algorithms (GAs). In this paper. we present a comprehensive analysis of two resource allocation algorithms based on GA for: 1) the initial placement of VNFs and 2) the scaling of VNFs to support traffic changes. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithms with a traditional integer …,True,_6zceo4AAAAJ:k8Z6L05lTy4C,103,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7885521/,627916678715962741,/scholar?cites=627916678715962741,,,https://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/handle/10230/37214/Rankothge_ieeetnsm_opt.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0
1280785,Learning operational requirements from goal models,2009,Dalal Alrajeh and Jeff Kramer and Alessandra Russo and Sebastin Uchitel,,,,265-275,IEEE,Goal-oriented methods have increasingly been recognised as an effective means for eliciting. elaborating. analysing and specifying software requirements. A key activity in these approaches is the elaboration of a correct and complete set of opertional requirements. in the form of pre- and trigger-conditions. that guarantee the system goals. Few existing approaches provide support for this crucial task and mainly rely on significant effort and expertise of the engineer. In this paper we propose a tool-based framework that combines model checking. inductive learning and scenarios for elaborating operational requirements from goal models. This is an iterative process that requires the engineer to identify positive and negative scenarios from counterexamples to the goals. generated using model checking. and to select operational requirements from suggestions computed by inductive learning.,True,_6zceo4AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,102,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5070527/,284578416886648586,/scholar?cites=284578416886648586,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dalal_Alrajeh/publication/221554580_Learning_operational_requirements_from_goal_models/links/02e7e52bddeb7a509f000000.pdf,0,0,0
1280786,An abductive approach for analysing event-based requirements specifications,2002,Alessandra Russo and Rob Miller and Bashar Nuseibeh and Jeff Kramer,,,,22-37,Springer. Berlin. Heidelberg,We present a logic and logic programming based approach for analysing event-based requirements specifications given in terms of a system’s reaction to events and safety properties. The approach uses a variant of Kowalski and Sergot’s Event Calculus to represent such specifications declaratively and an abductive reasoning mechanism for analysing safety properties. Given a system description and a safety property. the abductive mechanism is able to identify a complete set of counterexamples (if any exist) of the property in terms of symbolic “current” states and associated event-based transitions. A case study of an automobile cruise control system specified in the SCR framework is used to illustrate our approach. The technique described is implemented using existing tools for abductive logic programming.,True,_6zceo4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,102,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45619-8_3,9415149837990629471,/scholar?cites=9415149837990629471,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30655900/DTR01-7.pdf,0,0,0

Relevant configuration involves implementing network provisioning decisions. performing admission control. and adapting bandwidth allocation dynamically according to emerging traffic demands. A policy-based approach facilitates flexibility and adaptability in that the policies can be changed without changing the implementation. However. as with any other complex system. conflicts and inconsistencies may arise in the policy specification. In this work. we concentrate on the policy conflicts that may occur for static resource management aspects of QoS provisioning. known as network dimensioning.

Joint treatment of semi-formal model constructs and constraints within a single translation framework and conversion tool is novel. and leads to the generation of much richer formal specifications than is otherwise possible. This paper complements previous analyses by paying particular attention to the generation of complete Object-Z structures. Integration of proposals to extend the OCL to include action constraints also boosts the expressivity of the translated specifications.

1280795,A reification calculus for model-oriented software specification,1990,José Nuno Fonseca Oliveira,,,,,Springer Verlag,This paper presents a transformational approach to the derivation of  implementations from model-oriented specifications of abstract data types.  The purpose of this research is to reduce the number of formal proofs required  in model refinement. which hinder software development. It is shown to be appli-  cable to the transformation of models written in Meta-iv (the specification lan-  guage of Vdm) towards their refinement into. for example. Pascal or relational  DBMSs. The approach includes the automatic synthesis of retrieve functions  between models. and data-type invariants.  The underlying algebraic semantics is the so-called final semantics “`a la Wand”:  a specification “is” a model (heterogeneous algebra) which is the final ob ject (up  to isomorphism) in the category of all its implementations.  The transformational calculus approached in this paper follows from exploring  the properties of finite. recursively defined sets.  This work extends the well-known strategy of program transformation to model  transformation. adding to previous work on a transformational style for operation-  decomposition in META-IV.

This result strongly suggests that amplification of c-erbB-2 occurs frequently in tubular carcinomas in stomach cancer. Rearrangement of c-erbB-2 was also detected in one tubular adenocarcinoma. The rearranged fragment carried the 3'half. but not the 5'sequence. of the c-erbB-2 gene.

If a memory area is used by both an interrupt handler and other routines at the same time. the embedded system has the potential to fail because of unexpected data in the memory. To detect the race conditions of memory. this paper proposes a method of interrupt testing on a CPU emulator. The method consists of two features: one is interrupt generation at the instruction points that possibly causes race conditions; the other is replacing input value from external device to control interrupt handlers. An interrupt is generated just after the program reads or writes data on memory for the purpose of covering all possibility of sharing memory between the interrupt handler and other routines. Sequence of input value from the external device is prepared by hand before program execution.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Self-adaptation is typically realized using a control loop. One prominent approach for organizing a control loop in self-adaptive systems is by means of four components that are responsible for the primary functions of self-adaptation: Monitor. Analyze. Plan. and Execute. together forming a MAPE loop. When systems are large. complex. and heterogeneous. a single MAPE loop may not be sufficient for managing all adaptation in a system. so multiple MAPE loops may be introduced. In self-adaptive systems with multiple MAPE loops. decisions about how to decentralize each of the MAPE functions must be made. These decisions involve how and whether the corresponding functions from multiple loops are to be coordinated (e.g.. planning components coordinating to prepare a plan for an adaptation).

To date. the application of these techniques to software has been hindered by several obstacles. Chief among these is the problem of constructing a finite-state model that approximates the executable behavior of the software system of interest.

Amandroid determines points-to information for all objects in an Android app component in a flow and context-sensitive (user-configurable) way and performs data flow and data dependence analysis for the component. Amandroid also tracks inter-component communication activities. It can stitch the component-level information into the app-level information to perform intra-app or inter-app analysis. In this article. (a) we show that the aforementioned type of comprehensive app analysis is completely feasible in terms of computing resources with modern hardware.

Even worse. vocabulary conflicts and inconsistencies can be frequently found amongst the many sources and references commonly used by software measurement researchers and practitioners. This article presents an analysis of the current situation. and provides a comparison framework that can be used to identify and address the discrepancies. gaps. and terminology conflicts that current software measurement proposals present.

In the second and third sections. serving as a supplement to Chap. 1. 29 a wide review of the distinct kinds of ontologies and their proposed uses is presented respectively. In the fourth section. we offer a taxonomy for classifying ontologies in SET. in which two main categories are distinguished:(1) SET domain ontologies. created to represent and communicate agreed knowledge within some subdomain of SET. and (2) ontologies as software artifacts. with proposals in which ontologies play the role of an additional type of artifact in software processes.

The current competitive marketplace calls for the continuous improvement of processes and therefore. it is fundamental to have software process models with a high maintainability.

1280852,Exponential family embeddings,2016,Maja R Rudolph and Francisco JR Ruiz and Stephan Mandt and David M Blei,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1608.00778,,,,Word embeddings are a powerful approach for capturing semantic similarity among terms in a vocabulary. In this paper. we develop exponential family embeddings. a class of methods that extends the idea of word embeddings to other types of high-dimensional data. As examples. we studied neural data with real-valued observations. count data from a market basket analysis. and ratings data from a movie recommendation system. The main idea is to model each observation conditioned on a set of other observations. This set is called the context. and the way the context is defined is a modeling choice that depends on the problem. In language the context is the surrounding words; in neuroscience the context is close-by neurons; in market basket data the context is other items in the shopping cart. Each type of embedding model defines the context. the exponential family of conditional distributions. and how the latent embedding vectors are shared across data. We infer the embeddings with a scalable algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent. On all three applications-neural activity of zebrafish. users' shopping behavior. and movie ratings-we found exponential family embedding models to be more effective than other types of dimension reduction. They better reconstruct held-out data and find interesting qualitative structure.,True,_3mnobEAAAAJ:ktX0m338QuYC,103,https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00778,16573625594067055136,/scholar?cites=16573625594067055136,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00778,0,0,0

Since quality of models might be subject to different interpretations. it should be addressed in the most objective way. by the application of measures. That said. however. assessment of measurement results is not a straightforward task: it requires the identification of relevant threshold values. which are able to distinguish different levels of process model quality.Since there is no consensual technique for obtaining these values. this paper proposes the definition of thresholds for gateway complexity measures based on the application of statistical techniques on empirical data.To this end. we conducted a controlled experiment that evaluates quality characteristics of understandability and modifiability of process models in two different runs.

Business processes in hospitals are very complex and variable. BPMN (Business Process Modelling Notation) is a user-oriented language specifically designed for the modelling of business (organizational) processes.

The predictions obtained by applying these models tend to be optimistic due to the inaccuracies in the operational profile. and saturation effect of testing. Incorporating knowledge gained about some structural attribute of the code. such as test coverage. into the time-domain models can help alleviate this optimistic trend.

1280868,Who should fix this bug?,2006,John Anvik and Lyndon Hiew and Gail C Murphy,,,,361-370,,Open source development projects typically support an open bug repository to which both developers and users can report bugs. The reports that appear in this repository must be triaged to determine if the report is one which requires attention and if it is. which developer will be assigned the responsibility of resolving the report. Large open source developments are burdened by the rate at which new bug reports appear in the bug repository. In this paper. we present a semi-automated approach intended to ease one part of this process. the assignment of reports to a developer.

When a new bug report is submitted to the repository. a person. called a triager. examines whether it is a duplicate of an existing bug report. If it is. the triager marks it as DUPLICATE and the bug report is removed from consideration for further work. In the literature. there are approaches exploiting only natural language information to detect duplicate bug reports. In this paper we present a new approach that further involves execution information. In our approach. when a new bug report arrives. its natural language information and execution information are compared with those of the existing bug reports.

An important step in the triage process is the assignment of the report to a developer. Most previous efforts towards improving bug report assignment have focused on using an activity-based approach. We address some of the limitations of activity-based approaches by proposing a two-phased location-based approach where bug report assignment recommendations are based on the predicted location of the bug. The proposed approach utilizes a noun extraction process on several information sources to determine bug location information and a simple term weighting scheme to provide a bug report assignment recommendation.

The model is based on a generalized editing model of collaboration. which assumes that usersinteract with acollaborative application by concurrently editing its data structures. It associates fine-grained data displayed by a collaborative application with a set of collaboration rights and provides programmers and usersa multi-dimensional. inheritance-based schemefor specifying theserights. The collaboration rights include traditional read and write rights and severatnew rights suchasviewing rights and coupling rights.

Previous findings also show that distance collaboration aggravates software-development problems and radical colocation reduces them. These results motivate a semi-synchronous distributed computersupported model that allows programmers creating code asynchronously to synchronously collaborate with each other to detect and resolve potentially conflicting tasks before they have completed the tasks.

It is based on an interaction model and a user interface framework that allow users and programmers. respectively. to view applications as editors of data. It consists of a semantics model. a specification model. and an implementation model for coupling. The semantics model determines (1) which properties of interaction entities created for a user are shared with corresponding interaction entities created for other users and (2) when changes made by a user to a property of an interaction entity are communicated to other users sharing it. It divides the properties of an interaction entity into multiple coupling sets and allows users to share different coupling sets independently.

They can be used to embed typed languages into Haskell or ML.  However.  while such encodings guarantee that only well-formed data can be constructed. they do not permit type-safe deconstruction without additional tagging and run-time checks.  We introduce first-class phantom types. which make such constraints explicit via type equations.  Examples of first-class phantom types include typed type representations and typed higher-order abstract syntax trees. These types can be used to support typed generic functions. dynamic typing. and staged compilation in higher-order. statically typed languages such as Haskell or Standard ML.  In our system. type constraints can be equations between type constructors as well as type functions of higher-order kinds.

1280904,A new approach to generic functional programming,2000,Ralf Hinze,,,,119-132,,This paper describes a new approach to generic functional programming. which allows us to define functions generically for all datatypes expressible in Haskell. A generic function is one that is defined by induction on the structure of types. Typical examples include pretty printers. parsers. and comparison functions. The advanced type system of Haskell presents a real challenge: datatypes may be parameterized not only by types but also by type constructors. type definitions may involve mutual recursion. and recursive calls of type constructors can be arbitrarily nested. We show that—despite this complexity—a generic function is uniquely defined by giving cases for primitive types and type constructors (such as disjoint unions and cartesian products). Given this information a generic function can be specialized to arbitrary Haskell datatypes.

In Haskell types are assigned so-called kinds that distinguish between manifest types like the type of integers and functions on types like the list type constructor. Previous approaches to polytypic programming were restricted in that they only allowed to parameterize values by types of one fixed kind. In this paper we show how to define values that are indexed by types of arbitrary kinds. It turns out that these polytypic values possess types that are indexed by kinds. We present several examples that demonstrate that the additional flexibility is useful in practice. One paradigmatic example is the mapping function. which describes the functorial action on arrows. A single polytypic definition yields mapping functions for datatypes of arbitrary kinds including first- and higher-order functors. Polytypic values enjoy polytypic properties.

Berlin. Heidelberg,Component adaptation needs to be taken into account when developing trustworthy systems. where the properties of component assemblies have to be reliably obtained from the properties of its constituent components. Thus. a more systematic approach to component adaptation is required when building trustworthy systems. In this paper. we illustrate how (design and architectural) patterns can be used to achieve component adaptation and thus serve as the basis for such an approach. The paper proposes an adaptation model which is built upon a classification of component mismatches. and identifies a number of patterns to be used for eliminating them. We conclude by outlining an engineering approach to component adaptation that relies on the use of patterns and provides additional support for the development of trustworthy component-based systems.,True,jvlJKLkAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,137,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11786160_11,881449255607994743,/scholar?cites=881449255607994743,,,https://assets.cs.ncl.ac.uk/TRs/939.pdf,0,0,0

In our context. a system is correct when it is deadlock-free and performs only specified component interactions. In order to automatically synthesize the correct composition code. SYNTHESIS takes as input an high-level behavioural description for each component that must form the system to be built and a specification of the component interactions that must be enforced in the system. The automatically derived composition code is implemented as a set of distributed component wrappers that cooperatively interact with each other and with their wrapped components in order to prevent possible deadlocks and make the composed system exhibit only the specified interactions.

Heidelberg,Correct automatic assembly in software components is an important issue in CBSE (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf). Building a system from reusable software components or from COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components introduces a set of problems. One of the main problems in components assembly is related to the ability to properly manage the dynamic interactions of the components. Component assembling can result in architectural mismatches when trying to integrate components with incompatible interaction behavior like deadlock and other software anomalies. This problem represents a new challenge for system developers. The issue is not only in specifying and analyzing a set of properties rather in being able to enforce them out of a set of already implemented (local) behaviors.

Our answer to this problem is an architectural approach in which the software architecture imposed on the assembly prevents black-box integration anomalies. The basic idea is to build applications by assuming a “coordinator-based” architectural style. We. then. operate on the coordinating part of the system architecture to obtain an equivalent version of the system which is failure-free. A failure-free system is a deadlock-free one and it does not violate any specified coordination policy. A coordination policy models those interactions of components that are actually needed for the overall purpose of the system.

In this context. achieving interoperability among heterogeneous NSs represents an important issue. In order to mediate the NSs interaction protocol and solve possible mismatches. connectors are often built. However. connector development is a never-ending and error-prone task and prevents the eternality of NSs. For this reason. in the literature. many approaches propose the automatic synthesis of connectors.

Berlin. Heidelberg,The near future in service-oriented system development envisions a ubiquitous world of available services that collaborate to fit users’ needs. Modern service-oriented applications are often built by reusing and assembling distributed services. This can be done by considering a global specification of the interactions between the participant services. namely the choreography. In this paper. we propose a synthesis approach to automatically synthesize a choreography out of a specification of it and a set of services discovered as suitable participants. The synthesis is model-based in the sense that it works by assuming a finite state model of the services’s protocol and a BPMN model for the choreography specification. The result of the synthesis is a set of distributed components. called coordination delegates. that coordinate the services’ interaction in order to realize the specified choreography.

1280939,Fundamental principles of software engineering–a journey,2002,Pierre Bourque and Robert Dupuis and Alain Abran and James W Moore and Leonard Tripp and Sybille Wolff,62,Journal of Systems and Software,1,59-70,Elsevier,A set of fundamental principles can act as an enabler in the establishment of a discipline; however. software engineering still lacks a set of universally recognized fundamental principles. This article presents a progress report on an attempt to identify and develop a consensus on a set of candidate fundamental principles. A fundamental principle is less specific and more enduring than methodologies and techniques. It should be phrased to withstand the test of time. It should not contradict a more general engineering principle and should have some correspondence with “best practice”. It should be precise enough to be capable of support and contradiction and should not conceal a tradeoff. It should also relate to one or more computer science or engineering concepts. The proposed candidate set consists of fundamental principles which were identified through two workshops. two Delphi studies and a web-based …,True,6-X3908AAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,72,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121201001364,17105290351246783970,/scholar?cites=17105290351246783970,,,http://publicationslist.org/data/p.bourque/ref-827/978.pdf,0,0,0
1280940,Full function points: Counting practices manual,1997,Denis St-Pierre and Marcela Maya and Alain Abran and Jean-Marc Desharnais and Pierre Bourque,,,,,,Given its increasing importance in products and services. software has become a major component of corporate budgets. Like any other budget component. it is important to control these expenses. to analyze the performance of the amounts allocated to software development and to benchmark against the best in the field. To do so. measures and models using these measures are needed.Measures are needed for analyzing both the quality and the productivity of development and maintenance. On the one hand. technical measures are needed to measure the technical performance of products or services from a developer’s viewpoint. Technical measures can be used for efficiency analysis to improve the performance of the designs for example.,True,6-X3908AAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC,71,http://sites.poli.usp.br/d/pmr2490/fp_para_realtime.pdf,6746747477880240688,/scholar?cites=6746747477880240688,,,http://sites.poli.usp.br/d/pmr2490/fp_para_realtime.pdf,0,0,0
1280941,An experiment in software sizing with structured analysis metrics,1991,Pierre Bourque and Vianney Côté,15,Journal of Systems and Software,2,159-172,Elsevier,This paper presents an experiment that was carried out to develop and statistically validate a model that estimates the number of lines of code in a system. The experiment. described using an experimentation frame-work. was conducted at three Canadian organizations.A linear model is developed for each of the two samples studied. These models are based on measurements taken on data flow diagrams. Statistical analysis reveals that the models produce sound estimates of the actual data (R2 = 0.724 and R2 = 0.563). Four evaluation criteria show that these models compare favorably to the other software-sizing models found in the literature.,True,6-X3908AAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,50,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0164121291900539,11407489541798302610,/scholar?cites=11407489541798302610,,,http://publicationslist.org/data/p.bourque/ref-788/437.pdf,0,0,0
1280942,Developing project duration models in software engineering,2007,Pierre Bourque and Serge Oligny and Alain Abran and Bertrand Fournier,22,Journal of Computer Science and Technology,3,348-357,Springer,Based on the empirical analysis of data contained in the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) repository. this paper presents software engineering project duration models based on project effort. Duration models are built for the entire dataset and for subsets of projects developed for personal computer. mid-range and mainframe platforms. Duration models are also constructed for projects requiring fewer than 400 person-hours of effort and for projects requiring more than 400 person-hours of effort. The usefulness of adding the maximum number of assigned resources as a second independent variable to explain duration is also analyzed. The opportunity to build duration models directly from project functional size in function points is investigated as well.,True,6-X3908AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,47,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11390-007-9051-5.pdf,90960524212764164,/scholar?cites=90960524212764164,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alain_Abran/publication/225254019_Developing_Project_Duration_Models_in_Software_Engineering/links/09e4150af686620eb7000000.pdf,0,0,0
1280943,Agile monitoring using the line of balance,2010,Eduardo Miranda and Pierre Bourque,83,Journal of Systems and Software,7,1205-1215,Elsevier,There is a need to collect. measure. and present progress information in all projects. and Agile projects are no exception. In this article. the authors show how the line of balance. a relatively obscure indicator. can be used to gain insights into the progress of projects not provided by burn down charts or cumulative flow diagrams. two of the most common indicators used to track and report progress in Agile projects. The authors also propose to replace the original plan-based control point lead-time calculations with dynamic information extracted from a version control system and introduce the concept of the ideal plan to measure progress relative to both. end of iteration milestones and project completion date.,True,6-X3908AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121210000294,1570176915832730344,/scholar?cites=1570176915832730344,,,,0,0,0
1280944,Sizing user stories using paired comparisons,2009,Eduardo Miranda and Pierre Bourque and Alain Abran,51,Information and Software Technology,9,1327-1337,Elsevier,Agile estimation approaches usually start by sizing the user stories to be developed by comparing them to one another. Various techniques. with varying degrees of formality. are used to perform the comparisons – plain contrasts. triangulation. planning poker. and voting. This article proposes the use of a modified paired comparison method in which a reduced number of comparisons is selected according to an incomplete cyclic design. Using two sets of data. the authors show that the proposed method produces good estimates. even when the number of comparisons is reduced by half those required by the original formulation of the method.,True,6-X3908AAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC,41,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584909000391,11790659417497543518,/scholar?cites=11790659417497543518,,,,0,0,0
