WASp and Scar are two similar proteins that bind the p21 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex. but their effect on the nucleation activity of the complex was not known. We report that full-length. recombinant human Scar protein. as well as N-terminally truncated Scar proteins. enhance nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex. By themselves. these proteins either have no effect or inhibit actin polymerization. The actin monomer-binding W domain and the p21-binding A domain from the C terminus of Scar are both required to activate Arp2/3 complex.

From simple unicellular organisms that use phagocytosis to obtain their next meal. to complex metazoans in which phagocytic cells represent an essential branch of the immune system. evolution has armed cells with a fantastic repertoire of molecules that serve to bring about this complex event. Regardless of the organism or specific molecules concerned. however. all phagocytic processes are driven by a finely controlled rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. A variety of signals can converge to locally reorganise the actin cytoskeleton at a phagosome. and there are significant similarities and differences between different organisms and between different engulfment processes within the same organism.

The highest incidence for this disease is on Vancouver Island. Canada. where an outbreak is expanding into neighboring regions including mainland British Columbia and the United States. This outbreak is caused predominantly by C. gattii molecular type VGII. specifically VGIIa/major. In addition. a novel genotype. VGIIc. has emerged in Oregon and is now a major source of illness in the region. Through molecular epidemiology and population analysis of MLST and VNTR markers. we show that the VGIIc group is clonal and hypothesize it arose recently. The VGIIa/IIc outbreak lineages are sexually fertile and studies support ongoing recombination in the global VGII population. This illustrates two hallmarks of emerging outbreaks: high clonality and the emergence of novel genotypes via recombination. In macrophage and murine infections. the novel VGIIc genotype and VGIIa/major isolates from the United States are highly virulent compared to similar non-outbreak VGIIa/major-related isolates. Combined MLST-VNTR analysis distinguishes clonal expansion of the VGIIa/major outbreak genotype from related but distinguishable less-virulent genotypes isolated from other geographic regions. Our evidence documents emerging hypervirulent genotypes in the United States that may expand further and provides insight into the possible molecular and geographic origins of the outbreak.,True,PwzsyYsAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,335,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000850,8500541733564272357,/scholar?cites=8500541733564272357,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000850,0,0,0

However. we now demonstrate that the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is able to escape from within macrophages without killing the host cell by a novel expulsive mechanism. This process occurs in both murine J774 cells and primary human macrophages. It is extremely rapid and yet can occur many hours after phagocytosis of the pathogen.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a widespread fungal pathogen that causes a fatal meningitis in HIV and other immunocompromised patients. Following intracellular growth. cryptococci are able to escape their host cells by a non-lytic expulsive mechanism that may contribute to the invasion of the central nervous system. Non-lytic escape is also exhibited by some bacterial pathogens and is likely to facilitate long-term avoidance of the host immune system during latency. Here we show that phagosomes containing intracellular cryptococci undergo repeated cycles of actin polymerisation. These actin ‘flashes’ occur in both murine and human macrophages and are dependent on classical WASP-Arp2/3 complex mediated actin filament nucleation. Three dimensional confocal imaging time lapse revealed that such flashes are highly dynamic actin cages that form around the phagosome. Using fluorescent dextran as a phagosome membrane integrity probe. we find that the non-lytic expulsion of Cryptococcus occurs through fusion of the phagosome and plasma membranes and that. prior to expulsion. 95% of phagosomes become permeabilised. an event that is immediately followed by an actin flash.

In this study. we examined the molecular epidemiology. population structure. and virulence attributes of isolates collected from HIV/AIDS patients in Los Angeles County. California. We show that these isolates consist almost exclusively of VGIII molecular type. in contrast to the VGII molecular type isolates causing the North American Pacific Northwest outbreak. The global VGIII population structure can be divided into two molecular groups. VGIIIa and VGIIIb. Isolates from the Californian patients are virulent in murine and macrophage models of infection. with VGIIIa significantly more virulent than VGIIIb. Several VGIII isolates are highly fertile and produce abundant sexual spores that may serve as infectious propagules. The a and α VGIII MAT locus alleles are largely syntenic with limited rearrangements compared to the known VGI (a/α) and VGII (α) MAT loci. but each has unique characteristics including a distinct deletion flanking the 5′ VGIII MATa alleles and the α allele is more heterogeneous than the a allele.

The Listeria surface protein ActA synergises with recruited host proteins to induce actin polymerisation. propelling the bacterium through the host cytoplasm [1]. The Arp2/3 complex is one recruited host factor [2]. [3]; it is also believed to regulate actin dynamics in lamellipodia [4]. [5]. The Arp2/3 complex promotes actin filament nucleation in vitro. which is further enhanced by ActA [6]. [7]. The Arp2/3 complex also interacts with members of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) [8] family – Scar1 [9]. [10] and WASP itself [11].

Many questions remain regarding the function of macrophages in normal clearance of cryptococcal infection and the defects present in uncontrolled cryptococcosis. Two current limitations are: 1) The difficulties in interpreting studies using isolated macrophages in the context of the progression of infection. and 2) The use of high resolution imaging in understanding immune cell behavior during animal infection. Here we describe a high-content imaging method in a zebrafish model of cryptococcosis that permits the detailed analysis of macrophage interactions with C. neoformans during infection.

The causative agent. Cryptococcus neoformans. has a remarkable ability to 'hide' and proliferate within phagocytic cells of the human immune system. This intracellular phase is thought to underlie the ability of the pathogen to remain latent for long periods of time within infected individuals. We now report that Cryptococcus is able to undergo 'lateral transfer' between phagocytes. moving directly from infected to uninfected macrophages. This novel process was observed in both C. neoformans serotypes (A and D) and occurs in both immortalised cell lines and in primary human macrophages. Lateral transfer is independent of the initial route of uptake. since both serum-opsonised and antibody-opsonised C. neoformans are able to undergo direct cell-to-cell transfer. We provide the first evidence for lateral transfer of a human fungal pathogen. This rare event may occur repeatedly during latent cryptococcal infections. thereby allowing the pathogen to remain concealed from the immune system and protecting it from exposure to antifungal agents.,True,PwzsyYsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,100,https://bmcimmunol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2172-8-15,15726930852315523372,/scholar?cites=15726930852315523372,,https://bmcimmunol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2172-8-15,0,0,0

Powerful forwardgenetic tools that have made invertebrates justifiably famous are not only relatively accessible in the zebrafish. but have been exploited to yield new insights into human infectious diseases. including leprosy and tuberculosis [1]. Transgenic technologies have enabled detailed. non-invasive in vivo visualization of macrophages and neutrophils in pitched battle with bacteria and fungi [2. 3]. Reverse genetics with morpholinos. vivo-morpholinos. and zinc-finger nucleases (but unfortunately not homologous recombination. which for the moment remains out of reach in this organism) enable examination of the roles of specific genes during infection. Flexible genetic systems such as Gal4-UAS and Cre-Lox permit tissue-specific transformation and ablation ([3]; Figure 1).These technologies can be applied to hundreds of embryos in a single day. Zebrafish embryos at the one-to four-cell stage are microinjected with morpholinos to target translation or splicing of specific transcripts. or to limit microRN (mRNA) activity. This knockdown can be effective for up to 10 days post-fertilization. allowing relatively long-term imaging of infection in the background of specific gene knockdowns. Similarly. early microinjection with mRNA for the Tol2 transposase along with DNA constructs bracketed by Tol2 repeats results in remarkably efficient transgenesis.

The highest incidence for this disease is on Vancouver Island. Canada. where an outbreak is expanding into neighboring regions including mainland British Columbia and the United States. This outbreak is caused predominantly by C. gattii molecular type VGII. specifically VGIIa/major. In addition. a novel genotype. VGIIc. has emerged in Oregon and is now a major source of illness in the region. Through molecular epidemiology and population analysis of MLST and VNTR markers. we show that the VGIIc group is clonal and hypothesize it arose recently. The VGIIa/IIc outbreak lineages are sexually fertile and studies support ongoing recombination in the global VGII population. This illustrates two hallmarks of emerging outbreaks: high clonality and the emergence of novel genotypes via recombination. In macrophage and murine infections. the novel VGIIc genotype and VGIIa/major isolates from the United States are highly virulent compared to similar non-outbreak VGIIa/major-related isolates. Combined MLST-VNTR analysis distinguishes clonal expansion of the VGIIa/major outbreak genotype from related but distinguishable less-virulent genotypes isolated from other geographic regions.

Outbreak strains share a unique mitochondrial gene expression profile and an increased ability to tubularize their mitochondria within host macrophages. However. the underlying mechanism that causes this lineage of C. gattii to be virulent in immunocompetent individuals remains unexplained.

Although rare. the incidence of infections caused by fungi belonging to basal fungal lineages is also continuously increasing. Basal fungal lineages diverged at an early point during the evolution of the fungal lineage. in which. in a simplified four-phylum fungal kingdom. Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota belong to the basal fungi. distinguishing them from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Currently there are no known human infections caused by fungi in Chytridiomycota; only Zygomycotan fungi are known to infect humans. Hence. infections caused by zygomycetes have been called zygomycosis. and the term “zygomycosis” is often used as a synonym for “mucormycosis.” In the four-phylum fungal kingdom …,True,JRyIvYEAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,58,http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/5/4/a019562.short,3238102116641664745,/scholar?cites=3238102116641664745,,http://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/5/4/a019562.full.pdf,0,0,0

It is now the largest outbreak of a life-threatening fungal infection in a healthy population in recorded history. The high virulence of outbreak strains is closely linked to the ability of the pathogen to undergo rapid mitochondrial tubularisation and proliferation following engulfment by host phagocytes. Most outbreaks spread by geographic expansion across suitable niches. but it is known that genetic re-assortment and hybridisation can also lead to rapid range and host expansion. In the context of C. gattii. however. the likelihood of virulence traits associated with the outbreak lineages spreading to other lineages via genetic exchange is currently unknown. Here we address this question by conducting outgroup crosses between distantly related C. gattii lineages (VGII and VGIII) and ingroup crosses between isolates from the same molecular type (VGII). Systematic phenotypic characterisation shows that virulence traits are transmitted to outgroups infrequently. but readily inherited during ingroup crosses. In addition. we observed higher levels of biparental (as opposed to uniparental) mitochondrial inheritance during VGII ingroup sexual mating in this species and provide evidence for mitochondrial recombination following mating. Taken together. our data suggest that hypervirulence can spread among the C. gattii lineages VGII and VGIII. potentially creating novel hypervirulent genotypes. and that current models of uniparental mitochondrial inheritance in the Cryptococcus genus may not be universal.,True,JRyIvYEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,48,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003771,15411724337671745334,/scholar?cites=15411724337671745334,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003771,0,0,0

One of the major characteristics of cryptococcal disease is the ability of the pathogen to parasitise upon phagocytic immune effector cells. a phenomenon that correlates strongly with virulence in rodent models of infection. Despite the importance of phagocyte/Cryptococcus interactions to disease progression. current methods for assaying virulence in the macrophage system are both time consuming and low throughput. Here. we introduce the first stable and fully characterised GFP–expressing derivatives of two widely used cryptococcal strains: C. neoformans serotype A type strain H99 and C. gattii serotype B type strain R265. Both strains show unaltered responses to environmental and host stress conditions and no deficiency in virulence in the macrophage model system.

Birds can be colonised by cryptococci and can transmit cryptococcosis to humans via inhalation of inoculated bird excreta. However. colonisation of birds appears to occur in the absence of symptomatic infection. Here. using a pure population of primary bird macrophages. we demonstrate a mechanism for this relationship. We find that bird macrophages are able to suppress the growth of cryptococci seen in mammalian cells despite C. neoformans being able to grow at bird body temperature and are able to escape from bird macrophages by vomocytosis. A small subset of cryptococci are able to adapt to the inhibitory intracellular environment of bird macrophages. exhibiting a large cell phenotype that rescues growth suppression.

1186117,Innate and adaptive immunity to Mucorales,2017,Harlene Ghuman and Kerstin Voelz,3,,3,48,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection characterised by rapid filamentous growth. which leads to angioinvasion. thrombosis. and tissue necrosis. The high mortality rates (50–100%) associated with mucormycosis are reflective of not only the aggressive nature of the infection and the poor therapeutics currently employed. but also the failure of the human immune system to successfully clear the infection. Immune effector interaction with Mucorales is influenced by the developmental stage of the mucormycete spore. In a healthy immune environment. resting spores are resistant to phagocytic killing. Contrarily. swollen spores and hyphae are susceptible to damage and degradation by macrophages and neutrophils. Under the effects of immune suppression. the recruitment and efficacy of macrophage and neutrophil activity against mucormycetes is considerably reduced. Following penetration of the endothelial lining. Mucorales encounter platelets. Platelets adhere to both mucormycete spores and hyphae. and exhibit germination suppression and hyphal damage capacity in vitro. Dendritic cells are activated in response to Mucorales hyphae only. and induce adaptive immunity. It is crucial to further knowledge regarding our immune system’s failure to eradicate resting spores under intact immunity and inhibit fungal growth under immunocompromised conditions. in order to understand mucormycosis pathogenicity and enhance therapeutic strategies for mucormycosis.

Much of this regulation occurs at the level of gene expression and is controlled by transcription factors. In this work. we have mapped the binding of cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and RNA polymerase across the V. cholerae genome. We show that CRP is an integral component of the regulatory network that controls lifestyle switching. Focusing on a locus necessary for toxin transport. we demonstrate CRP-dependent regulation of gene expression in response to host colonization.

Two genes. rpb2. and tef1. are presented in detail. The rpb2 gene is more variable than tef1 and recovers well-supported clades at shallow and deep taxonomic levels. The tef1 gene recovers some deep and ordinal-level relationships but with greater branch support from nucleotides compared to amino acids.

Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Research Foundation,Ustilago maydis (DC.) Corda. Hygrophobic aerial conidia have been described for several species of Ustilaginales. such as Ustilago hypodytes (Schlecht.) Fr. and Sorosporium saponariae Rudolphi (13). While we try to avoid introducing separate anamorph binomials for holomorphic species. the species listed above seem to lack a perfect state or it is presently unknown. As species of smuts can be identified only on teleomorphic characteristics. such as host range. morphology of soni and teliospores (19. 22). it is difficult to compare the anamorphic species listed above with known species of smuts. Therefore comparative morphological. physiological. biochemical and molecular investigations of anamorphs of smuts will be useful. However. because several hundreds of species of smuts are involved. this task is not easily performed. A second possibility is to compare ribosomal DNA sequences in order to establish their phylogenetic position.

Single-locus models of selection cannot explain the maintenance of such complex variation because recombination separates co-adapted alleles. Here we report a previously unrecognized type of intraspecific multi-locus genetic variation that has been maintained over a vast period. The galactose (GAL) utilization gene network of Saccharomyces kudriavzevii. a relative of brewer’s yeast. exists in two distinct states: a functional gene network in Portuguese strains and. in Japanese strains. a non-functional gene network of allelic pseudogenes. Genome sequencing of all available S. kudriavzevii strains revealed that none of the functional GAL genes were acquired from other species.

We recently found sympatric pairs of Saccharomyces species. composed of one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species in oak bark samples of various geographic origins. In order to contribute to explain the occurrence in sympatry of Saccharomyces species. we screened Saccharomyces genomic data for protein divergence that might be correlated to distinct growth temperature preferences of the species. using the dN/dS ratio as a measure of protein evolution rates and pair-wise species comparisons. In addition to proteins previously implicated in growth at suboptimal temperatures. we found that glycolytic enzymes were among the proteins exhibiting higher than expected divergence when one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species are compared. By measuring glycolytic fluxes and glycolytic enzymatic activities in different species and at different temperatures. we subsequently show that the unusual divergence of glycolytic genes may be related to divergent evolution of the glycolytic pathway aligning its performance to the growth temperature profiles of the different species.

We have catalogued 1008 alleles described in the literature that cause phenotypic differences among animals. plants. and yeasts. Surprisingly. evolution of similar traits in distinct lineages often involves mutations in the same gene (“gene reuse”). This compilation yields three important qualitative implications about repeated evolution. First. the apparent evolution of similar traits by gene reuse can be traced back to two alternatives. either several independent causative mutations or a single original mutational event followed by sorting processes.

Here we re-emphasize the old standpoint that the genotype-phenotype relationship is best viewed as a connection between two differences. one at the genetic level and one at the phenotypic level. As of today. predominant thinking in biology research is that multiple genes interact with multiple environmental variables (such as abiotic factors. culture. or symbionts) to produce the phenotype. Often. the problem of linking genotypes and phenotypes is framed in terms of genotype and phenotype maps. and such graphical representations implicitly bring us away from the differential view of genotype-phenotype relationships. Here we show that the differential view of phenotype-genotype relationships is a useful explanatory framework in the context of pervasive pleiotropy. epistasis and environmental effects. In such cases. it is relevant to view genotype-phenotype relationships as differences embedded into differences.

1186199,Morphological evolution repeatedly caused by mutations in signaling ligand genes,2017,Arnaud Martin and Virginie Courtier-Orgogozo,,,,59-87,Springer. Singapore,What types of genetic changes underlie evolution? Secreted signaling molecules (syn. ligands) can induce cells to switch states and thus largely contribute to the emergence of complex forms in multicellular organisms. It has been proposed that morphological evolution should preferentially involve changes in developmental toolkit genes such as signaling pathway components or transcription factors. However. this hypothesis has never been formally confronted to the bulk of accumulated experimental evidence. Here we examine the importance of ligandcoding genes for morphological evolution in animals. We use Gephebase (http://www. gephebase. org). a database of genotype-phenotype relationships for evolutionary changes. and survey the genetic studies that mapped signaling genes as causative loci of morphological variation. To date. 19 signaling genes represent 20% of the cases where an animal morphological change has been mapped to a gene (80/391). This includes the signaling gene Agouti. which harbors multiple cis-regulatory alleles linked to color variation in vertebrates. contrasting with the effects of coding variation in its target. the melanocortin receptor MC1R. In sticklebacks. genetic mapping approaches have identified 4 signaling genes out of 14 loci associated with lake adaptations. Finally. in butterflies. a total of 18 allelic variants of the WntA Wnt-family ligand cause color pattern adaptations related to wing mimicry. both within and between species. We discuss possible hypotheses explaining these cases of natural replication (genetic parallelism) and conclude that signaling ligand loci are an important source of …,True,dX7KxnYAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C,15,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27823/1002182.pdf?sequence=1#page=68,4061175708225491792,/scholar?cites=4061175708225491792,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27823/1002182.pdf?sequence=1#page=68,0,0,0

Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence. and they have played an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and constraints in adaptive evolution. Here we contrast three butterfly species. all classic examples of Müllerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a locus. Yb. which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene. maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr. which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore. the same genomic location acts as a “supergene”. determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species. H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance. whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato. but they are not involved in mimetic polymorphism in H. numata. Hence. a single region from the multilocus colour pattern architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata. presumably as a result of selection for mimetic “supergene” polymorphism without intermediates.

We characterize nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium (LD). and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato.

Is there uniform potential for novelty across a genome or. on the contrary. can a small number of large-effect genes explain the phenotypic variation observed within and between species? Here we highlight recent work on butterfly wing pattern genetics showing that a small set of loci can be repeatedly involved in the evolution of complex traits. These loci behave as genomic hotspots for diversification because they underlie adaptive variation within and between species with both convergent and highly divergent wing patterns. These findings suggest that certain loci may be more likely than others to facilitate rapid evolutionary change.,True,Ah6lS28AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,56,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X08001792,11598376092835690651,/scholar?cites=11598376092835690651,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Reed10/publication/23769642_Genomic_hotspots_of_adaptation_in_butterfly_wing_pattern_evolution/links/5fa95e9b92851cc286a0852f/Genomic-hotspots-of-adaptation-in-butterfly-wing-pattern-evolution.pdf,0,0,0

Together with matching races of its co-mimic Heliconius melpomene. H. erato also represents a textbook case of Müllerian mimicry. a phenomenon where common warning signals are shared amongst noxious organisms. It is of great interest to identify the specific genes that control the mimetic wing patterns of H. erato and H. melpomene. To this end we have undertaken comparative mapping and targeted genomic sequencing in both species. This paper reports on a comparative analysis of genomic sequences linked to color pattern mimicry genes in Heliconius. Scoring AFLP polymorphisms in H. erato broods allowed us to survey loci at approximately 362 kb intervals across the genome. With this strategy we were able to identify markers tightly linked to two color pattern genes: D and Cr. which were then used to screen H. erato BAC libraries in order to identify clones for sequencing. Gene density across 600 kb of BAC sequences appeared relatively low. although the number of predicted open reading frames was typical for an insect. We focused analyses on the D- and Cr-linked H. erato BAC sequences and on the Yb-linked H. melpomene BAC sequence. A comparative analysis between homologous regions of H. erato (Cr-linked BAC) and H. melpomene (Yb-linked BAC) revealed high levels of sequence conservation and microsynteny between the two species.

Positional cloning and candidate gene studies have identified a handful of regulatory and pigmentation genes implicated in Heliconius wing pattern variation. but little is known about the greater developmental networks within which these genes interact to pattern a wing. Here we took a large-scale transcriptomic approach to identify the network of genes involved in Heliconius wing pattern development and variation. This included applying over 140 transcriptome microarrays to assay gene expression in dissected wing pattern elements across a range of developmental stages and wing pattern morphs of Heliconius erato. We identified a number of putative early prepattern genes with color-pattern related expression domains. We also identified 51 genes differentially expressed in association with natural color pattern variation. Of these. the previously identified color pattern “switch gene” optix was recovered as the first transcript to show color-specific differential expression. Most differentially expressed genes were transcribed late in pupal development and have roles in cuticle formation or pigment synthesis. These include previously undescribed transporter genes associated with ommochrome pigmentation.

Although this work demonstrates a number of cases where homologous loci underlie both convergent and divergent wing pattern change among different Heliconius species. it is still unclear exactly how many loci underlie pattern variation across the genus. To address this question for Heliconius erato. we created fifteen independent crosses utilizing the four most distinct color pattern races and analyzed color pattern segregation across a total of 1271 F2 and backcross offspring. Additionally. we used the most variable brood. an F2 cross between H. himera and the east Ecuadorian H. erato notabilis. to perform a quantitative genetic analysis of color pattern variation and produce a detailed map of the loci likely involved in the H. erato color pattern radiation. Using AFLP and gene based markers. we show that fewer major genes than previously envisioned control the color pattern variation in H. erato. We describe for the first time the genetic architecture of H. erato wing color pattern by assessing quantitative variation in addition to traditional linkage mapping. In particular. our data suggest three genomic intervals modulate the bulk of the observed variation in color. Furthermore. we also identify several modifier loci of moderate effect size that contribute to the quantitative wing pattern variation.

In Heliconius butterflies. a small number of genes control the development of diverse wing colour patterns. Here. we used full-genome sequencing of individuals across the Heliconius erato radiation and closely related species to characterize genomic variation associated with wing pattern diversity. We show that variation around colour pattern genes is highly modular. with narrow genomic intervals associated with specific differences in colour and pattern.

The genes controlling pattern variation are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect. where allelic variation causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium (LD). and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern. we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old. However. across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. Interestingly. coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated. suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites. conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as “supergenes.” Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic.

This evolutionary process can complete speciation. thereby providing a direct link between Darwin's theory of natural selection and the origin of new species. Here. by examining a case of speciation by reinforcement in Drosophila. we present the first high-resolution genetic study of variation within species for female mating discrimination that is enhanced by natural selection. We show that reinforced mating discrimination is inherited as a dominant trait. exhibits variability within species. and may be influenced by a known set of candidate genes involved in olfaction. Our results show that the genetics of reinforced mating discrimination is different from the genetics of mating discrimination between species. suggesting that overall mating discrimination might be a composite phenomenon. which in Drosophila could involve both auditory and olfactory cues. Examining the genetics of reinforcement provides a unique opportunity for both understanding the origin of new species in the face of gene flow and identifying the genetic basis of adaptive female species preferences. two major gaps in our understanding of speciation.,True,9lRkMOIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,119,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020416,14431949841770605311,/scholar?cites=14431949841770605311,,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020416,0,0,0

It is of great interest to identify the specific genes that control the mimetic wing patterns of H. erato and H. melpomene.

This paper reports on a comparative analysis of genomic sequences linked to color pattern mimicry genes in Heliconius. Scoring AFLP polymorphisms in H. erato broods allowed us to survey loci at approximately 362 kb intervals across the genome. With this strategy we were able to identify markers tightly linked to two color pattern genes: D and Cr. which were then used to screen H. erato BAC libraries in order to identify clones for sequencing.

Although this work demonstrates a number of cases where homologous loci underlie both convergent and divergent wing pattern change among different Heliconius species. it is still unclear exactly how many loci underlie pattern variation across the genus. To address this question for Heliconius erato. we created fifteen independent crosses utilizing the four most distinct color pattern races and analyzed color pattern segregation across a total of 1271 F2 and backcross offspring. Additionally. we used the most variable brood. an F2 cross between H. himera and the east Ecuadorian H. erato notabilis. to perform a quantitative genetic analysis of color pattern variation and produce a detailed map of the loci likely involved in the H. erato color pattern radiation. Using AFLP and gene based markers. we show that fewer major genes than previously envisioned control the color pattern variation in H. erato. We describe for the first time the genetic architecture of H. erato wing color pattern by assessing quantitative variation in addition to traditional linkage mapping. In particular. our data suggest three genomic intervals modulate the bulk of the observed variation in color.

We were surprised to find that the cis-regulatory architecture of optix is characterized by pleiotropy and regulatory fragility. where deletion of individual cis-regulatory elements has broad effects on both color pattern and wing vein development.

The loci controlling such patterns are “hotspots” for adaptive evolution with great allelic diversity across different species in the genus. We characterise nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium. and candidate gene expression at two loci and across multiple hybrid zones in Heliconius melpomene and relatives. Alleles at HmB control the presence or absence of the red forewing band. while alleles at HmYb control the yellow hindwing bar. Across HmYb two regions. separated by ∼100 kb. show significant genotype-by-phenotype associations that are replicated across independent hybrid zones.

However. the extent to which hybridization results in the transfer of genetic material across the species boundary (introgression) remains unknown in many systems. as does the length of time after initial divergence that the species boundary remains porous to such gene flow. Here I use genome-wide genotypic and DNA sequence data to show that there is introgression and admixture between the melpomene/cydno and silvaniform clades of the butterfly genus Heliconius. groups that separated from one another as many as 30 million generations ago. Estimates of historical migration based on 523 DNA sequences from 14 genes suggest unidirectional gene flow from the melpomene/cydno clade into the silvaniform clade. Furthermore. genetic clustering based on 520 amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) identified multiple individuals of mixed ancestry showing that introgression is on-going. These results demonstrate that genomes can remain porous to gene flow very long after initial divergence. This. in turn. greatly expands the evolutionary potential afforded by introgression. Phenotypic and species diversity in a wide variety of organisms. including Heliconius. have likely arisen from introgressive hybridization.

To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses. we measured DNA sequence divergence around putatively introgressed mimicry loci and compared this with the rest of the genome. Our results reveal that putatively introgressed regions show strongly reduced sequence divergence between co-mimetic species. suggesting that their divergence times are younger than the rest of the genome.

This approach has broad potential for genetic analysis of non-model organisms including genotype-phenotype association mapping. phylogeography. population genetics and scaffolding genome assemblies through linkage mapping. We constructed a RAD library using genomic DNA from a Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) backcross that segregated for resistance to the insecticide spinosad. Sequencing of 24 individuals was performed on a single Illumina GAIIx lane (51 base paired-end reads). Taking advantage of the lack of crossing over in homologous chromosomes in female Lepidoptera. 3.177 maternally inherited RAD alleles were assigned to the 31 chromosomes. enabling identification of the spinosad resistance and W/Z sex chromosomes. Paired-end reads for each RAD allele were assembled into contigs and compared to the genome of Bombyx mori (n = 28) using BLAST. revealing 28 homologous matches plus 3 expected fusion/breakage events which account for the difference in chromosome number. A genome-wide linkage map (1292 cM) was inferred with 2.878 segregating RAD alleles inherited from the backcross father. producing chromosome and location specific sequenced RAD markers.

Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence. and they have played an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and constraints in adaptive evolution.

Yb. which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of Heliconius melpomene. maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr. which has very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore. the same genomic location acts as a “supergene”. determining multiple sympatric morphs in a third species. H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic appearance. whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the genus Melinaea.

Unless butterfly eyes have adaptations for discriminating mimetic color variation. mimicry also carries a risk of confusion for the butterflies themselves. Heliconius butterfly eyes. which express recently duplicated ultraviolet (UV) opsins. have such an adaptation. To examine bird and butterfly color vision as sources of selection on butterfly coloration. we studied yellow wing pigmentation in the tribe Heliconiini. We confirmed. using reflectance and mass spectrometry. that only Heliconius use 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine (3-OHK). which looks yellow to humans but reflects both UV- and long-wavelength light. whereas butterflies in related genera have chemically unknown yellow pigments mostly lacking UV reflectance.

This behaviour has been hypothesized to be beneficial in terms of information sharing and/or anti-predator defence. To better understand the adaptive value of communal roosting. we tested these two hypotheses in field studies. The information-sharing hypothesis was addressed by examining following behaviour of butterflies departing from natural roosts. We found no evidence of roost mates following one another to resources. thus providing no support for this hypothesis. The anti-predator defence hypothesis was tested using avian-indiscriminable Heliconius erato models placed singly and in aggregations at field sites.

In Drosophila the Hippo signaling pathway functions to suppress growth in imaginal discs and has been suggested to control organ size. To investigate the role of hippo signaling in regulation of mammalian organ size we have generated conditional alleles of Sav1. mst1. and mst2. orthologs of Drosophila Salvador and hippo. respectively. Specific deletion of both mst1 and mst2 in hepatocytes results in significantly enlarged livers due to excessive proliferation. By the age of 5–6 months. mst1/2 conditional mutant livers have multiple foci of liver tumors. indicating that the combined activities of mst1 and mst2 act as redundant tumor suppressors in hepatocytes.

Its expression and that of its Drosophila homolog DMLP1 are enriched in striated muscle and coincide with myogenic differentiation. In the absence of MLP. induced C2 cells express myogenin but fail to exit from the cell cycle and to differentiate. Over-expression of MLP in C2 myoblasts potentiates myogenic differentiation and reduces its sensitivity to TGFβ. Like MLP. single LIM domain deletion mutants of MLP and nonmuscle LIM-only proteins promote myogenic differentiation. In 3T3 fibroblasts. the same LIM proteins prevent phorbol ester-induced inhibition of DNA replication.

Using a new strongly-supported estimate of phylogeny for almost all bumblebee species. we apply these criteria to reduce the system to 15 subgenera. and we assess the consequences.

The genes controlling pattern variation are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect. where allelic variation causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize nucleotide variation. genotype-by-phenotype associations. linkage disequilibrium (LD). and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern. we see neither a strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are quite old. However. across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. Interestingly. coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated. suggesting that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites. conforming to previous descriptions of these loci as “supergenes.” Examination of gene expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic.

Positional cloning and candidate gene studies have identified a handful of regulatory and pigmentation genes implicated in Heliconius wing pattern variation. but little is known about the greater developmental networks within which these genes interact to pattern a wing. Here we took a large-scale transcriptomic approach to identify the network of genes involved in Heliconius wing pattern development and variation. This included applying over 140 transcriptome microarrays to assay gene expression in dissected wing pattern elements across a range of developmental stages and wing pattern morphs of Heliconius erato. We identified a number of putative early prepattern genes with color-pattern related expression domains. We also identified 51 genes differentially expressed in association with natural color pattern variation. Of these. the previously identified color pattern “switch gene” optix was recovered as the first transcript to show color-specific differential expression. Most differentially expressed genes were transcribed late in pupal development and have roles in cuticle formation or pigment synthesis. These include previously undescribed transporter genes associated with ommochrome pigmentation.

Using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. we estimated relationships within each lineage to infer the processes that gave rise to the colour diversity and develop hypotheses on species recognition.

1186378,On dorsal prothoracic appendages in treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) and the nature of morphological evidence,2012,István Mikó and Frank Friedrich and Matthew J Yoder and Heather M Hines and Lewis L Deitz and Matthew A Bertone and Katja C Seltmann and Matthew S Wallace and Andrew R Deans,7,PLoS One,1,e30137,Public Library of Science,A spectacular hypothesis was published recently. which suggested that the “helmet” (a dorsal thoracic sclerite that obscures most of the body) of treehoppers (Insecta: Hemiptera: Membracidae) is connected to the 1st thoracic segment (T1; prothorax) via a jointed articulation and therefore was a true appendage. Furthermore. the “helmet” was interpreted to share multiple characteristics with wings. which in extant pterygote insects are present only on the 2nd (T2) and 3rd (T3) thoracic segments. In this context. the “helmet” could be considered an evolutionary novelty. Although multiple lines of morphological evidence putatively supported the “helmet”-wing homology. the relationship of the “helmet” to other thoracic sclerites and muscles remained unclear. Our observations of exemplar thoraces of 10 hemipteran families reveal multiple misinterpretations relevant to the “helmet”-wing homology hypothesis as originally conceived: 1) the “helmet” actually represents T1 (excluding the fore legs); 2) the “T1 tergum” is actually the anterior dorsal area of T2; 3) the putative articulation between the “helmet” and T1 is actually the articulation between T1 and T2. We conclude that there is no dorsal. articulated appendage on the membracid T1. Although the posterior. flattened. cuticular evagination (PFE) of the membracid T1 does share structural and genetic attributes with wings. the PFE is actually widely distributed across Hemiptera. Hence. the presence of this structure in Membracidae is not an evolutionary novelty for this clade.

Given their close relationships with their hosts. social parasites are particularly informative to understand antagonistic coevolution and the essential components of sociality.

In bees. this division of labor allows queens and workers to phenotypically specialize. Worker traits associated with helping are thought to be crucial to the fitness of a eusocial lineage. and recent studies of honey bees (genus Apis) have found that adaptively evolving genes often have worker-biased expression patterns. It is unclear however if worker-biased genes are disproportionately acted on by strong positive selection in all eusocial insects.

1186385,Melanic variation underlies aposematic color variation in two hymenopteran mimicry systems,2017,Heather M Hines and Paige Witkowski and Joseph S Wilson and Kazumasa Wakamatsu,12,PloS one,7,e0182135,Public Library of Science,The stinging hymenopteran velvet ants (Mutillidae) and bumble bees (Apidae: Bombus spp.) have both undergone extensive diversification in aposematic color patterns. including yellow-red hues and contrasting dark-light body coloration. as a result of Müllerian mimicry. Understanding the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying shifts in these mimetic colors requires characterization of their pigmentation. In this study. a combination of solubility. spectrophotometry. and melanin degradation analysis are applied to several color forms and species of these lineages to determine that orange-red colors in both lineages are comprised of primarily dopamine-derived pheomelanins. Until a few recent studies. pheomelanins were thought not to occur in insects. These results support their potential to occur across insects and particularly among the Hymenoptera. Shifts between black and orange-red colors. such as between mimetic color forms of bumble bee Bombus melanopygus. are inferred to involve modification of the ratios of dark eumelanins to red pheomelanins. thus implicating the melanin pathway in mimetic diversification. This discovery highlights the need to focus on how pheomelanins are synthesized in the insect melanin pathway and the potential for new pigments to be found even in some of our most well-known insect systems.,True,N4wh9f8AAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,18,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182135,6106368775950039480,/scholar?cites=6106368775950039480,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0182135,0,0,0

Determining the evolutionary causes of this pattern remains a challenging task. To address this issue. previous LDG studies have usually relied on correlations between environmental variables and species richness. only considering evolutionary processes indirectly. Instead. we use a phylogenetically integrated approach to investigate the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for the global LDG observed in swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae). We find evidence for the ‘diversification rate hypothesis’ with different diversification rates between two similarly aged tropical and temperate clades. We conclude that the LDG is caused by (1) climatically driven changes in both clades based on evidence of responses to cooling and warming events. and (2) distinct …,True,W5FvZ84AAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,195,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01737.x,10370923895203550139,/scholar?cites=10370923895203550139,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39767842/What_causes_latitudinal_gradients_in_spe20151107-1912-a6ln2e.pdf,0,0,0

1186400,Sex-linked genes and species differences in Lepidoptera,1994,Felix AH Sperling,,,,,,I review reports on the genetic basis for species differences in the Lepidoptera. In the six best-studied species complexes. more than half of all ecological. behavioral. or physiological differences among species are controlled by X-linked genes. Because Lepidoptera have about 30 pairs of chromosomes. this finding clearly indicates strong bias toward X-linkage of genes for species differences. The proportion of X-linked species differences ranges from complete X-linkage in Colias butterflies. to almost none in Yponomeuta moths. Four other complexes all have at least one X-linked gene that is crucial to species differences. including the Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens. Papilio glaucus L.. and Papilio machaon L. species groups. and Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner pheromone strains. The mechanisms that account for this phenomenon are open to speculation. Nonetheless. an interesting implication of disproportionate X-linkage is that reproductive isolation may frequently arise by selection on linkage complexes. rather than as a random byproduct of evolution in geographically isolated populations. If confirmed. the bias toward X-linked species differences may also help efforts to find characters that distinguish host races and sibling species. as well as provide an avenue by which genes crucial to speciation can be more easily mapped and characterized at the molecular level.,True,W5FvZ84AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,138,https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/30067c34-3180-427d-83d0-c381a799a8fe,5735662999659869106,/scholar?cites=5735662999659869106,,https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/30067c34-3180-427d-83d0-c381a799a8fe/view/63daa423-8e06-4fec-8cb9-04e4f4143924/CE_126_1994_807.pdf,0,0,0
1186401,Butterfly molecular systematics: from species definitions to higher-level phylogenies,2003,FAH Sperling,,Butterflies: ecology and evolution taking flight,,431-458,University Chicago Press: Chicago. IL. USA,Butterfly systematics is experiencing a renaissance. Its renewed vigor is due to the widespread realization that robust phylogenies and objective species delimitations are crucial for comparative investigations in biology and conservation. as well as to the recent development of easily applied techniques for assaying DNA sequences and other molecular variation (Hillis et al. 1996). Molecular techniques have allowed a surge in systematic investigations ranging in scope from surveys of gene flow among intraspecific populations to examinations of deep phylogenetic divergences (eg Brower 1994b; Sperling and Harrison 1994; Weller et al. 1995).However. the advantages of molecular investigations may also be a source of fundamental problems. A student can usually produce reliable molecular datasets in a matter of months. whereas it often takes years to train a researcher who is proficient at morphological character analysis. On the other hand. the ease of producing sequence data has produced an ever-growing patchwork that is difficult to compare meaningfully among studies. Furthermore. proper sampling and analysis of molecular data is not straightforward. and neglect of these issues can seriously limit the value of studies. The purpose of this chapter is to evaluate the use of genetic markers in butterfly systematics. both with respect to species level problems and higher level relationships. Specifically. I ask two questions: 1) Are some kinds of genetic markers particularly effective in delineating butterfly species boundaries?. and 2) What DNA sequence regions are most useful for higher level phylogenies in butterflies?

This grouping distinguished OG1RF and GelE metalloprotease-expressing isolates from JH2-2 and other GelE-negative isolates. The integrity of the fsrABDC operon was found to determine the exoproteome composition. since an fsrB mutant of strain OG1RF appeared very similar to that of strain JH2-2. and complementation of the latter with the fsrABDC operon produced an OG1RF-like exoproteome. The proteins present in the supernatant fraction of OG1RF were separated using 2D gels and identified by mass spectrometry and comprised many mass and pI variants of the GelE and SprE proteases. In addition cell wall synthesis and cell division proteins were identified. An OG1RF fsrB mutant had a distinct exoprotein fraction with an absence of the Fsr-regulated proteases and was characterised by general stress and glycolytic proteins.

Staphylococcus aureus is able to invade a variety of mammalian. non-professional phagocytes and can also survive engulfment by professional phagocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes. In both of these cell types S. aureus promptly escapes from the endosomes/phagosomes and proliferates within the cytoplasm. which quickly leads to host cell death. In this report we show that S. aureus interacted with human monocyte-derived macrophages in a very different way to those of other mammalian cells. Upon phagocytosis by macrophages. S. aureus persisted intracellularly in vacuoles for 3–4 days before escaping into the cytoplasm and causing host cell lysis. Until the point of host cell lysis the infected macrophages showed no signs of apoptosis or necrosis and were functional. They were able to eliminate intracellular staphylococci if prestimulated with interferon-γ at concentrations equivalent to human therapeutic doses. S. aureus survival was dependent on the alternative sigma factor B as well as the global regulator agr. but not SarA. Furthermore. isogenic mutants deficient in α-toxin. the metalloprotease aureolysin. protein A. and sortase A were efficiently killed by macrophages upon phagocytosis. although with different kinetics. In particular α-toxin was a key effector molecule that was essential for S. aureus intracellular survival in macrophages. Together. our data indicate that the ability of S. aureus to survive phagocytosis by macrophages is determined by multiple virulence factors in a way that differs considerably from its interactions with other cell types.

Based on this. we postulated that S. aureus might induce cytoprotective mechanisms by changing gene expression profiles inside macrophages similar to obligate intracellular pathogens. such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To validate our hypothesis we first ascertained whether S. aureus infection could affect programmed cell death in human (hMDMs) and mouse (RAW 264.7) macrophages and. specifically. protect these cells against apoptosis. Our findings indicate that S. aureus-infected macrophages are more resistant to staurosporine-induced cell death than control cells. an effect partly mediated via the inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore. transcriptome analysis of human monocyte-derived macrophages during S. aureus infection revealed a significant increase in the expression of antiapoptotic genes. This was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of selected genes involved in mitochondria-dependent cell death. clearly showing overexpression of BCL2 and MCL1. Cumulatively. the results of our experiments argue that S. aureus is able to induce a cytoprotective effect in macrophages derived from different mammal species. which can prevent host cell elimination. and thus allow intracellular bacterial survival.

There is mounting evidence to suggest that these opposing roles are therapeutically relevant in that mutation of agr results in increased biofilm formation and decreased antibiotic susceptibility while mutation of sarA has the opposite effect. To the extent that induction of agr or inhibition of sarA could potentially be used to limit biofilm formation. this makes it important to understand the epistatic relationships between these two loci.  Methodology/Principal Findings We generated isogenic sarA and agr mutants in clinical isolates of S. aureus and assessed the relative impact on biofilm formation. Mutation of agr resulted in an increased capacity to form a biofilm in the 8325-4 laboratory strain RN6390 but had little impact in clinical isolates S. aureus. In contrast. mutation of sarA resulted in a reduced capacity to form a biofilm in all clinical isolates irrespective of the functional status of agr. This suggests that the regulatory role of sarA in biofilm formation is independent of the interaction between sarA and agr and that sarA is epistatic to agr in this context. This was confirmed by demonstrating that restoration of sarA function restored the ability to form a biofilm even in the corresponding agr mutants. Mutation of sarA in clinical isolates also resulted in increased production of extracellular proteases and extracellular nucleases. both of which contributed to the biofilm-deficient phenotype of sarA mutants.

Previous transcriptional profiling experiments identified a number of genes that are differentially expressed both in a biofilm and in a sarA mutant. This included genes involved in acid tolerance and the production of nucleolytic and proteolytic exoenzymes. Based on this we generated mutations in alsSD. nuc and sspA in the S. aureus clinical isolate UAMS-1 and its isogenic sarA mutant and assessed the impact on biofilm formation. Because expression of alsSD was increased in a biofilm but decreased in a sarA mutant. we also generated a plasmid construct that allowed expression of alsSD in a sarA mutant. Mutation of alsSD limited biofilm formation. but not to the degree observed with the corresponding sarA mutant. and restoration of alsSD expression did not restore the ability to form a biofilm. In contrast. concomitant mutation of sarA and nuc significantly enhanced biofilm formation by comparison to the sarA mutant. Although mutation of sspA had no significant impact on the ability of a sarA mutant to form a biofilm. a combination of protease inhibitors (E-64. 1-10-phenanthroline. and dichloroisocoumarin) that was shown to inhibit the production of multiple extracellular proteases without inhibiting growth was also shown to enhance the ability of a sarA mutant to form a biofilm. This effect was evident only when all three inhibitors were used concurrently.

Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for proteinaceous material in the biofilm structure. The S. aureus genome encodes many secreted proteases. and there is growing evidence that these enzymes have self-cleavage properties that alter biofilm integrity. However. the specific contribution of each protease and mechanism of biofilm modulation is not clear. To address this issue. we utilized a sigma factor B (ΔsigB) mutant where protease activity results in a biofilm-negative phenotype. thereby creating a condition where the protease(s) responsible for the phenotype could be identified.

Activation of these attenuated or silenced genes to obtain either improved titers of known compounds or new ones altogether has been a subject of considerable interest. In our efforts to discover new chemotypes that are effective against infectious diseases. including malaria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). we have isolated a strain of marine fungus. Leucostoma persoonii. that produces bioactive cytosporones. Epigenetic modifiers employed to activate secondary metabolite genes resulted in enhanced production of known cytosporones B (1. 360%). C (2. 580%) and E (3. 890%). as well as the production of the previously undescribed cytosporone R (4). Cytosporone E was the most bioactive. displaying an IC 90 of 13 µM toward Plasmodium falciparum. with A549 cytotoxicity IC 90 of 437 µM. representing a 90% inhibition therapeutic index (TI 90= IC 90 A459/IC 90 P. falciparum) of 33. In addition. cytosporone E was active against MRSA with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 72 µM and inhibition of MRSA biofilm at roughly half that value (minimum biofilm eradication counts.

The progression of disease in S. aureus is subject to multi-factorial regulation. in response to the environments encountered during growth. This adaptive nature is thought to be central to pathogenesis. and is the result of multiple regulatory mechanisms employed in gene regulation. In this work we describe the existence of a novel S. aureus regulator. an as yet uncharacterized ECF-sigma factor (σS). that appears to be an important component of the stress and pathogenic responses of this organism. Using biochemical approaches we have shown that σS is able to associates with core-RNAP. and initiate transcription from its own coding region. Using a mutant strain we determined that σS is important for S. aureus survival during starvation. extended exposure to elevated growth temperatures. and Triton X-100 induced lysis. Coculture studies reveal that a σS mutant is significantly outcompeted by its parental strain. which is only exacerbated during prolonged growth (7 days). or in the presence of stressor compounds. Interestingly. transcriptional analysis determined that under standard conditions. S. aureus SH1000 does not initiate expression of sigS. Assays performed hourly for 72h revealed expression in typically background ranges.

1186441,Global analysis of transcriptional regulators in Staphylococcus aureus,2013,Jose Antonio Ibarra and Ernesto Pérez-Rueda and Ronan K Carroll and Lindsey N Shaw,14,BMC genomics,1,1-12,BioMed Central,Staphylococcus aureus is a widely distributed human pathogen capable of infecting almost every ecological niche of the host. As a result. it is responsible for causing many different diseases. S. aureus has a vast array of virulence determinants whose expression is modulated by an intricate regulatory network. where transcriptional factors (TFs) are the primary elements. In this work. using diverse sequence analysis. we evaluated the repertoire of TFs and sigma factors in the community-associated methicillin resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) strain USA300-FPR3757. A total of 135 TFs and sigma factors were identified and classified into 36 regulatory families. From these around 43% have been experimentally characterized to date. which demonstrates the significant work still at hand to unravel the regulatory network in place for this important pathogen. A comparison of the TF repertoire of S. aureus against 1209 sequenced bacterial genomes was carried out allowing us to identify a core set of orthologous TFs for the Staphylococacceae. and also allowing us to assign potential functions to previously uncharacterized TFs. Finally. the USA300 TFs were compared to those in eleven other S. aureus strains including: Newman. COL. JH1. JH9. MW2. Mu3. Mu50. N315. RF122. MRSA252 and MSSA476.

1186453,Collagen corneal shields,2002,CE Willoughby and M Batterbury and SB Kaye,47,,2,174-182,Elsevier,Collagen corneal shields were developed as a corneal bandage lens and are currently indicated for ocular surface protection following surgery and in traumatic and nontraumatic corneal conditions. Collagen shields are manufactured from porcine or bovine collagen and three different collagen shields are currently available with dissolution times of 12. 24. and 72 hours. The theoretical. experimental. and clinical evidence supports a role for collagen corneal shields as a drug delivery device and in the promotion of epithelial and stromal healing. Presoaking the collagen shield in a pharmacological agent with adjunctive topical treatment represents the most efficacious method of utilizing collagen shields for drug delivery. In microbial keratitis collagen shields can enhance drug delivery. promote epithelial and stromal healing. neutralize collagenases. and reduce corneal inflammation.

Data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox regression. and binary logistic regression to determine the influence of surgical procedure on graft survival and visual outcome.Results.: The risk of graft failure for DALK was almost twice that for PK (P= 0.02). Nineteen percent of the DALK failures occurred in the first 30 postoperative days compared with only 2% of PK failures. When these early failures were excluded. there was little difference between the 3-year graft survivals for DALK (92%; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 85%–95%) and PK (94%; 95% CI. 92%–95%)(P= 0.8). Although the mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was similar for the two procedures (P= 0.7). 33% of patients who underwent PK achieved a BCVA of 6/6 or better at 2 years compared with only 22% of those who underwent DALK (P< 0.001). Those with DALK were also likely to be more myopic (<− 3 D) but there was little difference in scalar cylinder.Conclusions.: DALK had a higher overall failure rate than PK. The difference was largely accounted for by early failures. which appeared to be related to the surgeon's experience.

FA. and ICGA. Images were graded independently by two observers and assessed for quality. phases of fluorescence. and leakage. Areas of CNV and vasculature geometric properties were analyzed and quantified by an automated program.Results.: Twenty-three patients with good quality images were included. Mean times to appearance of ICG and fluorescein were 17 and 20 seconds (P= 0.10). Best images for analysis were obtained at 64 seconds for ICGA and 47 seconds for FA. CNV not apparent on color or FA. particularly in the presence of scarring. was well delineated by ICGA. Leakage of ICGA did not occur. Fluorescein leakage from apical CNV images occurred significantly earlier (32 seconds) in patients with CNV of< 6-month duration than those of> 1-year (50 seconds) duration (P= 0.04). Mean area of CNV and vessel diameter were similar with ICGA (8.79 mm 2. 0.058 mm) or FA (7.74 mm 2. 0.054 mm) but significantly larger than on color (1.94 mm 2. 0.026 mm) images (P< 0.01).

Phylogenetic studies show that host shifts are a frequent event in the evolution of most pathogens. but why pathogens successfully jump between some host species but not others is only just becoming clear. The susceptibility of potential new hosts can vary enormously. with close relatives of the natural host typically being the most susceptible. Often. pathogens must adapt to successfully infect a novel host. for example by evolving to use different cell surface receptors. to escape the immune response. or to ensure they are transmitted by the new host. In viruses there are often limited molecular solutions to achieve this. and the same sequence changes are often seen each time a virus infects a particular host. These changes may come at a cost to other aspects of the pathogen's fitness. and this may sometimes prevent host shifts from occurring.

Species must continually evolve to survive in the face of their evolving enemies. yet on average their fitness remains unchanged. We define three modes of Red Queen coevolution to unify both fluctuating and directional selection within the Red Queen framework. Empirical evidence from natural interspecific antagonisms provides support for each of these modes of coevolution and suggests that they often operate simultaneously.

CF lungs often contain a diverse range of P. aeruginosa phenotypes. some of which are likely to contribute to the persistence of infection. yet the causes of diversity are unclear.

First. if prudent use of host resources (a form of cooperation) maximizes the transmission success of the parasite population. decreased relatedness is predicted to result in increased host exploitation and virulence. Experimental support for this well-established theoretical result is surprisingly limited. Second. if parasite within-host growth rate is a positive function of cooperation …,True,jNVIr6MAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,138,https://www.nature.com/articles/6801093,3588722933913886405,/scholar?cites=3588722933913886405,,https://www.nature.com/articles/6801093,0,0,0

Surprisingly. the role of extrinsic ecological parameters remains largely unconsidered. Disturbances 3. 4 are widespread in nature and have evolutionary consequences [5]. We develop a mathematical model predicting that cooperative traits most readily evolve at intermediate disturbance. Under infrequent disturbance. cooperation breaks down through the accumulation of evolved cheats. Higher rates of disturbance prevent this because the resulting bottlenecks increase genetic structuring (relatedness 6. 7. 8) promoting kin selection for cooperation.

However. cooperation is expected to more readily evolve if it imposes a smaller cost. Such costs of cooperation are expected to decline with increasing resource supply. an ecological parameter that varies widely in nature. We experimentally tested the effect of resource supply on the evolution of cooperation using two well-studied bacterial public-good traits: biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens and siderophore production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The frequency of cooperative bacteria increased with resource supply in the context of both bacterial public-good traits. In both cases this was due to decreasing costs of investment into public-goods cooperation with increasing resource supply.

Increasing economic development. human migration. global trade. and climate change are all shifting the geographic distribution of existing human. livestock. companion animal. and wildlife parasites [1–9]. As a result. human populations encounter new infections more frequently. and coinfection by multiple parasites from different lineages or species within individual hosts occurs. Coinfection may have a large impact on the hosts and parasites involved. often as a result of synergistic or antagonistic interactions between parasites [10]. Indeed. mixed-species coinfections have been found to influence parasite establishment. growth. maturation. reproductive success. and/or drug efficacy [11–13]. However. coinfections can allow for heterospecific (between-species or between-lineage) mate pairings. resulting in parthenogenesis (asexual reproduction in which eggs occur without fertilization). introgression (the introduction of single genes or chromosomal regions from one species into that of another through repeated backcrossing). and whole-genome admixture through hybridization [14].Recent molecular developments have revealed instances of fertile hybridization and introgression in plants [15]. animals [16. 17]. and humans [18].

However. although several transgenic labelling myeloid cells exist. none allow distinction of macrophages from neutrophils. This prevents simultaneous imaging and examination of the individual contributions of these important leukocyte subtypes during inflammation. We therefore used Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) recombineering to generate a transgenic Tg(fms:GAL4.VP16)i186. in which expression of the hybrid transcription factor Gal4-VP16 is driven by the fms (CSF1R) promoter.

Further crossing this compound transgenic with the neutrophil transgenic Tg(mpx:GFP)i114 allowed clear distinction between macrophages and neutrophils and simultaneous imaging of their recruitment and behaviour during inflammation. Compared with neutrophils. macrophages migrate significantly more slowly to an inflammatory stimulus. Neutrophil number at a site of tissue injury peaked around 6 hours post injury before resolving. while macrophage recruitment increased until at least 48 hours.

Its efficient release from activated immune cells requires a secondary stimulus such as extracellular ATP acting on P2X7 receptors. We show that human THP-1 monocytes shed microvesicles from their plasma membrane within 2–5 s of activation of P2X7 receptors. Two minutes after such stimulation. the released microvesicles contained bioactive IL-1β. which only later appeared in the vesicle-free supernatant.

Despite this. basic questions about the evolution and population biology of the species. particularly with regard to the extent and impact of homologous recombination. remain unanswered. We address these issues through an analysis of sequence data obtained from the characterization by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of 334 isolates of S. aureus. recovered from a well-defined population. over a limited time span. We find no significant differences in the distribution of multilocus genotypes between strains isolated from carriers and those from patients with invasive disease; there is. therefore. no evidence from MLST data. which index variation within the stable “core” genome. for the existence of …,True,a9XBI-wAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,688,https://jb.asm.org/content/185/11/3307.short,11773514074737922520,/scholar?cites=11773514074737922520,,https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/185/11/3307.full.pdf,0,0,0

This study examined the relationship between disease in humans and a large number of putative virulence determinants. both individually and in combination. S. aureus isolates (n = 334) from healthy blood donors and from patients with invasive disease were compared for variation in the presence of 33 putative virulence determinants. After adjusting for the effect of clonality. seven determinants (fnbA. cna. sdrE. sej. eta. hlg. and ica) were significantly more common in invasive isolates.

Infection is often associated with bacterial dissemination to distant sites. and there are many possible disease manifestations. with melioidosis septic shock being the most severe. Eradication of the organism following infection is difficult. with a slow fever-clearance time. the need for prolonged antibiotic therapy and a high rate of relapse if therapy is not completed. Mortality from melioidosis septic shock remains high despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

The peripheral blood parasite count measures only the circulating. relatively non-pathogenic parasite numbers. P. falciparum releases a specific histidine-rich protein (PfHRP2) into plasma. Quantitative measurement of plasma PfHRP2 concentrations may reflect the total parasite biomass in falciparum malaria.   Methods and Findings We measured plasma concentrations of PfHRP2. using a quantitative antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in 337 adult patients with falciparum malaria of varying severity hospitalised on the Thai–Burmese border. Based on in vitro production rates. we constructed a model to link this measure to the total parasite burden in the patient. The estimated geometric mean parasite burden was 7 × 1011 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.8 × 1011 to 8.5 × 1011) parasites per body. and was over six times higher in severe malaria (geometric mean 1.7 × 1012. 95% CI 1.3 × 1012 to 2.3 × 1012) than in patients hospitalised without signs of severity (geometric mean 2.8 × 1011. 95% CI 2.3 × 1011 to 3.5 × 1011; p < 0.001).

Therefore. it is critical to benchmark the various methodologies for interrogating the composition of microbial communities. so that we can assess their strengths and limitations. The most common phylogenetic marker for microbial community diversity studies is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and in the last 10 years the field has moved from sequencing a small number of amplicons and samples to more complex studies where thousands of samples and multiple different gene regions are interrogated. We assembled 2 synthetic communities with an even (EM) and uneven (UM) distribution of archaeal and bacterial strains and species. as metagenomic control material. to assess performance of different experimental strategies. The 2 synthetic communities were used in this study. to highlight the limitations and the advantages of the leading sequencing platforms: MiSeq (Illumina).

1186674,Insect infection and immunity: evolution. ecology. and mechanisms,2009,Jens Rolff and Stuart Reynolds,,,25,,Oxford University Press on Demand,Under continual attack from both microbial pathogens and multicellular parasites. insects must cope with immune challenges every day of their lives. However. this has not prevented them from becoming the most successful group of animals on the planet. Insects possess highly-developed innate immune systems which have been fine-tuned by an arms race with pathogens spanning hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary history. Recent discoveries are revealing both an unexpected degree of specificity and an indication of immunological memory-the functional hallmark of vertebrate immunity. The study of insect immune systems has accelerated rapidly in recent years and is now becoming an important interdisciplinary field. Furthermore. insects are a phenomenally rich and diverse source of antimicrobial chemicals. Some of these are already being seriously considered as potential therapeutic agents to control microbes such as MRSA. Despite a burgeoning interest in the field. this is the first book to provide a coherent synthesis and is clearly structured around two broadly themed sections: mechanisms of immunity and evolutionary ecology. This novel text adopts an interdisciplinary and concept-driven approach. integrating insights from immunology. molecular biology. ecology. evolutionary biology. parasitology. and epidemiology. It features contributions from an international team of leading experts. Insect Infection and Immunity is suitable for both graduate students and researchers interested in insect immunity from either an evolutionary. genetical. physiological or molecular perspective.

Lysogens carrying Stx phages can cause severe. life-threatening disease and Stx toxin is an integral virulence factor. The Stx-bacteriophage vB_EcoP-24B. commonly referred to as Ф24B. is capable of multiply infecting a single bacterial host cell at a high frequency. with secondary infection increasing the rate at which subsequent bacteriophage infections can occur. This is biologically unusual. therefore determining the genomic content and context of Ф24B compared to other lambdoid Stx phages is important to understanding the factors controlling this phenomenon and determining whether they occur in other Stx phages. The genome of the Stx2 encoding phage. Ф24B was sequenced and annotated. The genomic organisation and general features are similar to other sequenced Stx bacteriophages induced from Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). however Ф24B possesses significant regions of heterogeneity. with implications for phage biology and behaviour. The Ф24B genome was compared to other sequenced Stx phages and the archetypal lambdoid phage. lambda. using the Circos genome comparison tool and a PCR-based multi-loci comparison system. The data support the hypothesis that Stx phages are mosaic. and recombination events between the host. phages and their remnants within the same infected bacterial cell will continue to drive the evolution of Stx phage variants and the subsequent dissemination of shigatoxigenic potential.,True,UxgGIvoAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,81,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-311,13310650832901394235,/scholar?cites=13310650832901394235,,https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-13-311,0,0,0

Professor Paul Buchner. probably the most prominent founder of systematic symbiosis research. wrote:“I too soon fell victim to the spell of this subject. and from 1911 on devoted myself to it.” Almost half a century later. a growing number of entomologists are recognizing the impact that arthropod-bacteria symbiosis has on virtually all aspects of the biology of both host and symbiont. The discussion of this subject tends to be system based. with primary emphasis on the insect host. However. recent screening studies have revealed that the diversity of bacteria associated with arthropods may not be as wide as initially expected. and some genera are constantly being found in hosts that belong to distantly related taxa. Manipulative Tenants: Bacteria Associated with Arthropods introduces the fascinating world of bacteria-arthropod associations with an emphasis on the bacterial partner. Written by an interdisciplinary team of international contributors. this book provides an overview of the diversity of bacterial symbionts identified to date as frequent partners of terrestrial arthropods. It discusses primary (obligatory) symbionts as well as the most abundant secondary (facultative) symbionts currently known.

Studies of taxis have primarily used Escherichia coli and Salmonella as model organism. However. more recent studies of other bacterial species revealed a significant diversity in the chemotaxis mechanisms which are reviewed here. Differences include the genomic abundance. size and topology of chemoreceptors. the mode of signal binding. the presence of additional cytoplasmic signal transduction proteins or the motor mechanism. This diversity of chemotactic mechanisms is partly due to the diverse nature of input signals.

Two models are presented: a high resolution 1.9 Å model and a 2.6 Å model which contains bound Mg-ADP. The enzyme is an α/β protein consisting of a central sheet of five parallel β-strands flanked by α-helices with overall topology similar to adenylate kinase. Evidence is presented that shikimate kinase undergoes major conformational changes on ligand binding. It resembles adenylate kinase in having a P-loop containing core structure and two flexible domains which undergo induced fit movement on substrate binding.

1186729,The distribution of plasmids that carry virulence and resistance genes in Staphylococcus aureus is lineage associated,2012,Alex J McCarthy and Jodi A Lindsay,12,BMC microbiology,1,1-8,BioMed Central,Staphylococcus aureus is major human and animal pathogen. Plasmids often carry resistance genes and virulence genes that can disseminate through S. aureus populations by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanisms. Sequences of S. aureus plasmids in the public domain and data from multi-strain microarrays were analysed to investigate (i) the distribution of resistance genes and virulence genes on S. aureus plasmids. and (ii) the distribution of plasmids between S. aureus lineages. A total of 21 plasmid rep gene families. of which 13 were novel to this study. were characterised using a previously proposed classification system. 243 sequenced plasmids were assigned to 39 plasmid groups that each possessed a unique combination of rep genes. We show some resistance genes (including ermC and cat) and virulence genes (including entA. entG. entJ. entP) were associated with specific plasmid groups suggesting there are genetic pressures preventing recombination of these genes into novel plasmid groups. Whole genome microarray analysis revealed that plasmid rep. resistance and virulence genes were associated with S. aureus lineages. suggesting restriction-modification (RM) barriers to HGT of plasmids between strains exist. Conjugation transfer (tra) complex genes were rare. This study argues that genetic pressures are restraining the spread of resistance and virulence genes amongst S. aureus plasmids. and amongst S. aureus populations. delaying the emergence of fully virulent and resistant strains.,True,ZesDPi4AAAAJ:blknAaTinKkC,126,https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-12-104,13367558355024897594,/scholar?cites=13367558355024897594,,https://bmcmicrobiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2180-12-104,0,0,0

Staphylococcus aureus secretes the 16 kD Extracellular fibrinogen binding protein (Efb) that binds two different plasma proteins using separate domains: the Efb N-terminus binds to fibrinogen. while the C-terminus binds complement C3. In this study. we show that Efb blocks phagocytosis of S. aureus by human neutrophils. In vitro. we demonstrate that Efb blocks phagocytosis in plasma and in human whole blood. Using a mouse peritonitis model we show that Efb effectively blocks phagocytosis in vivo. either as a purified protein or when produced endogenously by S. aureus. Mutational analysis revealed that Efb requires both its fibrinogen and complement binding residues for phagocytic escape. Using confocal and transmission electron microscopy we show that Efb attracts fibrinogen to the surface of complement-labeled S. aureus generating a ‘capsule’-like shield. This thick layer of fibrinogen shields both surface-bound C3b and antibodies from recognition by phagocytic receptors. This information is critical for future vaccination attempts. since opsonizing antibodies may not function in the presence of Efb.

1186769,Staphylococcus aureus host cell invasion and virulence in sepsis is facilitated by the multiple repeats within FnBPA,2010,Andrew M Edwards and Jennifer R Potts and Elisabet Josefsson and Ruth C Massey,6,PLoS Pathog,6,e1000964,Public Library of Science,Entry of Staphylococcus aureus into the bloodstream can lead to metastatic abscess formation and infective endocarditis. Crucial to the development of both these conditions is the interaction of S. aureus with endothelial cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the staphylococcal invasin FnBPA triggers bacterial invasion of endothelial cells via a process that involves fibronectin (Fn) bridging to α5β1 integrins. The Fn-binding region of FnBPA usually contains 11 non-identical repeats (FnBRs) with differing affinities for Fn. which facilitate the binding of multiple Fn molecules and may promote integrin clustering. We thus hypothesized that multiple repeats are necessary to trigger the invasion of endothelial cells by S. aureus. To test this we constructed variants of fnbA containing various combinations of FnBRs. In vitro assays revealed that endothelial cell invasion can be facilitated by a single high-affinity. but not low-affinity FnBR. Studies using a nisin-inducible system that controlled surface expression of FnBPA revealed that variants encoding fewer FnBRs required higher levels of surface expression to mediate invasion. High expression levels of FnBPA bearing a single low affinity FnBR bound Fn but did not invade. suggesting that FnBPA affinity for Fn is crucial for triggering internalization. In addition. multiple FnBRs increased the speed of internalization. as did higher expression levels of FnBPA. without altering the uptake mechanism. The relevance of these findings to pathogenesis was demonstrated using a murine sepsis model. which showed that multiple FnBRs were required for virulence.

We show that resistance to methicillin induces changes in the cell wall. which affects the bacteria's agr quorum sensing system.

Several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon are discussed and a mathematical model is used to argue that a complex transmission pathway is the key factor in explaining the evolution and maintenance of virulence in S. aureus.

Despite the relative simplicity of bacterial genomes. the application of GWASs to identify polymorphisms responsible for important bacterial phenotypes has only recently been made possible through advances in genome sequencing technologies. Bacterial GWASs are now about to come of age thanks to the availability of massive datasets. and because of the potential to bridge genomics and traditional genetic approaches that is provided by improving validation strategies. A small number of pioneering GWASs in bacteria have been published in the past 2 years. examining from 75 to more than 3.000 strains. The experimental designs have been diverse. taking advantage of different processes in bacteria for generating variation. Analysis of data from bacterial GWASs can. to some extent. be performed using software developed for eukaryotic systems. but there are important differences in genome evolution that must be considered.

This bacterium uses its fibronectin binding proteins (FnBPs) to invade host cells and it has been hypothesised that this provides a protected niche from host antimicrobial defences. allows access to deeper tissues and provides a reservoir for persistent or recurring infections. FnBPs contain multiple tandem fibronectin-binding repeats (FnBRs) which bind fibronectin with varying affinity but it is unclear what selects for this configuration. Since both colonisation and skin infection are dependent upon the interaction of S. aureus with keratinocytes we hypothesised that this might select for FnBP function and thus composition of the FnBR region. Initial experiments revealed that S. aureus attachment to keratinocytes is rapid but does not require FnBRs. By contrast. invasion of keratinocytes was dependent upon the FnBR region and occurred via similar cellular processes to those described for endothelial cells. Despite this. keratinocyte invasion was relatively inefficient and appeared to include a lag phase. most likely due to very weak expression of α5β1 integrins. Molecular dissection of the role of the FnBR region revealed that efficient invasion of keratinocytes was dependent on the presence of at least three high-affinity (but not low-affinity) FnBRs. Over-expression of a single high-affinity or three low-affinity repeats promoted invasion but not to the same levels as S. aureus expressing an FnBPA variant containing three high-affinity repeats.

1186784,Molecular mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus nasopharyngeal colonization,2012,Andrew M Edwards and Ruth C Massey and SR Clarke,27,,1,1-10,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a wide range of different infections ranging in severity from mild to fatal. However. it primarily exists as a commensal organism in a number of different anatomical sites including the nasopharynx. Although colonization itself is a harmless state. colonized individuals are at risk of endogenous infection when S. aureus enters otherwise sterile sites via wounds or indwelling medical devices. As such. studies of colonization may identify important targets for vaccines or other prophylactic approaches.

These strains are more virulent than health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) due to higher levels of toxin expression. In a previous study. we showed that the high-level expression of PBP2a. the alternative penicillin binding protein encoded by the mecA gene on type II staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements. reduced toxicity by interfering with the Agr quorum sensing system.

This corrosion is concerning. because a large amount of metal ions and debris are generated in this process. the accumulation of which may lead to adverse tissue reactions in vivo. The goal of this study is to investigate the mechanisms for implant degradation by evaluating the surface of five titanium dental implants retrieved due to peri-implantitis. The results demonstrated that all the implants were subjected to very acidic environments. which. in combination with normal implant loading. led to cases of severe implant discoloration. pitting attack. cracking and fretting-crevice corrosion. The results suggest that acidic environments induced by bacterial biofilms and/or inflammatory processes may trigger oxidation of the surface of titanium dental implants.

Given the specificity of phages for their bacterial hosts. there is growing interest in using phage therapies to combat the rising incidence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. A significant barrier to such therapies is the rapid development of phage-resistant bacteria. highlighting the need to understand how bacteria acquire phage resistance in vivo. Here we identify novel lytic phages in municipal raw sewage that kill Enterococcus faecalis. a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that resides in the human intestine.

Similar to the viruses of plants and animals. phages are inert and are unable to propagate themselves in the absence of a host. Phages depend on host metabolism to provide the organic material and machinery necessary for their replication and for the subsequent packaging of the viral genetic material during phage particle biosynthesis. Phages are associated with nearly all known bacterial taxa and. as a result. are found in diverse environments that range from soil to oceans and even in deserts (Prestel.

Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and their associated Cas proteins (CRISPR-Cas) provide prokaryotes with a mechanism for defense against mobile genetic elements (MGEs). A CRISPR locus is a molecular memory of MGE encounters. It contains an array of short sequences. called spacers. that generally have sequence identity to MGEs. Three different CRISPR loci have been identified among strains of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. CRISPR1 and CRISPR3 are associated with the cas genes necessary for blocking MGEs. but these loci are present in only a subset of E. faecalis strains. The orphan CRISPR2 lacks cas genes and is ubiquitous in E. faecalis. although its spacer content varies from strain to strain. Because CRISPR2 is a variable locus occurring in all E. faecalis. comparative analysis of CRISPR2 sequences may provide information about the clonality of E. faecalis strains. We examined CRISPR2 sequences from 228 E. faecalis genomes in relationship to subspecies phylogenetic lineages (sequence types; STs) determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). and to a genome phylogeny generated for a representative 71 genomes.

Compound 12 was efficacious in the P. berghei (Pb) model of malaria. This compound displayed an excellent pharmacokinetic profile with a long half-life (19 h) in rat blood. This profile led to an extended survival of animals for over 30 days following a dose of 50 mg/kg in the Pb malaria model. Compound 12 retains its potency against a panel of Pf isolates with known mechanisms of resistance. The fast killing observed in the in vitro parasite reduction ratio (PRR) assay coupled with the extended survival highlights the promise of this novel chemical class for the treatment of …,True,izfBipsAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC,32,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm500715u,8675439751913976571,/scholar?cites=8675439751913976571,,,0,0,0

Microcrystalline cellulose passed through sieve no.80. having a volumetric mean diameter (d 50 ) of 28.35 µm. was used to form composite particles with powdered mannitol which was previously passed through sieve no. 80. in various mixing ratios. The composite particles were evaluated for their powder and compression properties. An increase in the microcrystalline cellulose proportion imparted greater compressibility to the composite particles. but the flowability of these mixtures was decreased. Although microcrystalline cellulose and mannitol have been extensively used in the formulation of fast dissolving tablets. the non-wetting property of the hard compact central core may delay the disintegration time. Optimized co-processed formulation containing mannitol and microcrystalline cellulose in the ratio of 1.25:1 was found to have optimized powder and compressibility characteristics with fast disintegrating property (<15 s). Photomicrographs have shown that the mannitol crystals are fine and uniformly distributed in the microcrystalline matrix in spray dried form compared to physical mixture of the same combination. The fast disintegration may be due to the partial amorphization and formation of submicron particles of mannitol.

Material and method: The bark powder of W. tinctoria was extracted with 95% ethanol by continuous heat extraction and was subjected for phytochemical investigation and screened for wound healing activity in the incision. excision and dead space wound models in rats. A supportive study made on granuloma tissue to estimate the hydroxyproline content and histopathological examination to determine the pattern of lay-down for collagen using Masson Trichrome stain. Results: Triterpenoids. steroids and saponins were found to be present in ethanol extract of the barks of W. tinctoria. In resutured incision wound model. ethanol extract showed significant breaking strength (P< 0.01) compared to control. The ethanol extract promotes better wound healing by increasing the percentage wound closure and decreasing epithelization time (P< 0.001) compared to control. Statistically significant increase (P< 0.001) was observed in breaking strength and hydroxyproline content of ten day old granuloma of drug treated animals compared to control animals in dead space wound model. Conclusion: The results of the present study reveal that ethanol extract of bark of W. tinctoria have significant wound healing activity. The pro-healing action seems to be due to the increased synthesis of collagen. it’s cross-linking as well as better alignment and maturation.

Inc.,Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here. we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress.

1186930,Differential susceptibility of interneurons expressing neuropeptide Y or parvalbumin in the aged hippocampus to acute seizure activity,2011,Ramkumar Kuruba and Bharathi Hattiangady and Vipan K Parihar and Bing Shuai and Ashok K Shetty,6,PloS one,9,e24493,Public Library of Science,Acute seizure (AS) activity in old age has an increased predisposition for evolving into temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Furthermore. spontaneous seizures and cognitive dysfunction after AS activity are often intense in the aged population than in young adults. This could be due to an increased vulnerability of inhibitory interneurons in the aged hippocampus to AS activity. We investigated this issue by comparing the survival of hippocampal GABA-ergic interneurons that contain the neuropeptide Y (NPY) or the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV) between young adult (5-months old) and aged (22-months old) F344 rats at 12 days after three-hours of AS activity. Graded intraperitoneal injections of the kainic acid (KA) induced AS activity and a diazepam injection at 3 hours after the onset terminated AS-activity. Measurement of interneuron numbers in different hippocampal subfields revealed that NPY+ interneurons were relatively resistant to AS activity in the aged hippocampus in comparison to the young adult hippocampus. Whereas. PV+ interneurons were highly susceptible to AS activity in both age groups. However. as aging alone substantially depleted these populations. the aged hippocampus after three-hours of AS activity exhibited 48% reductions in NPY+ interneurons and 70% reductions in PV+ interneurons. in comparison to the young hippocampus after similar AS activity. Thus. AS activity-induced TLE in old age is associated with far fewer hippocampal NPY+ and PV+ interneuron numbers than AS-induced TLE in the young adult age.

India,The development of radioprotective agents has been a subject of intense research in view of their potential for use within a radiation environment. such as space exploration. radiotherapy and even nuclear war. Since no ideal. safe synthetic radioprotectors are available to date. the search for alternative sources. including plants. has been on-going for several decades. In the Traditional Indian system of medicine. several plants have been used to treat radiation-mediated ailments.  A systematic screening approach can only provide leads to identify potential new molecular entities from plant sources. for mitigation of radiation injury. This article reviews the milestones in development of radioprotectors with emphasis on perspectives of variety of plants. their bioactive principles and several alternative approaches tested in in vitro and in vivo model systems for radioprotection. With an overview of our own work carried out in this area. this review highlights the unique inherent properties in plants and the phytochemicals that aid in preventing free radical-induced oxidative stress during radiation therapy.

FRE exhibited significantly higher steady state antioxidant activity than FRW. FRE exhibited concentration dependent DPPH. ABTS•-. hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation with IC50 comparable with tested standard compounds. In vitro radioprotective potential of FRE was studied using micronucleus assay in irradiated Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (V79). Pretreatment with different doses of FRE 1h prior to 2 Gy γ-radiation resulted in a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in the percentage of micronucleated binuclear V79 cells. Maximum radioprotection was observed at 20 μg/ml of FRE. The radioprotection was found to be significant (P < 0.01) when cells were treated with optimum dose of FRE (20 μg/ml) 1 h prior to 0.5. 1. 2. 3 and 4 Gy γ-irradiation compared to the respective radiation controls. The cytokinesis-block proliferative index indicated that FRE does not alter radiation induced cell cycle delay.

1187047,Oxidative stress and NLRP3-inflammasome activity as significant drivers of diabetic cardiovascular complications: therapeutic implications,2018,Arpeeta Sharma and Mitchel Tate and Geetha Mathew and James E Vince and Rebecca H Ritchie and Judy B De Haan,9,,,114,Frontiers,It is now increasingly appreciated that inflammation is not limited to the control of pathogens by the host. but rather that sterile inflammation which occurs in the absence of viral or bacterial pathogens. accompanies numerous disease states. none more so than the complications that arise as a result of hyperglycaemia. Individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D. T2D) are at increased risk of developing cardiac and vascular complications. Glucose and blood pressure lowering therapies have not stopped the advance of these morbidities that often lead to fatal heart attacks and/or stroke. A unifying mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced cellular damage was initially proposed to link elevated blood glucose levels with oxidative stress and the dysregulation of metabolic pathways. Pre-clinical evidence has. in most cases. supported this notion. However. therapeutic strategies to lessen oxidative stress in clinical trials has not proved efficacious. most likely due to indiscriminate targeting by antioxidants such as vitamins. Recent evidence now suggests that oxidative stress is a major driver of inflammation and vice versa. with the latest findings suggesting not only a key role for inflammatory pathways underpinning metabolic and haemodynamic dysfunction in diabetes. but furthermore that these perturbations are driven by activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome.

Atherosclerosis. which is relatively unknown among contemporary hunter-gatherer populations. has reached pandemic proportions in recent times. Being an evolutionary problem with several inter-related pathologies. current therapeutic strategy for treating atherosclerosis has inherent limitations. Reviewing evolution-linked risk factors suggests that there are four aspects to the etiology of atherosclerosis namely. decreased intestinal parasitism. oversensitivity of evolutionarily redundant mast cells. chronic underactivation of AMPK (cellular energy sensor) and a deficiency of vitamin D. A combination of these four causes appear to have precipitated the atherosclerosis pandemic in modern times. Man and worms co-existed symbiotically in the past.

Pulse radiolysis technique is employed to study the one-electron oxidation of folic acid in homogeneous aqueous solution. The radicals used for this study are CCl3O2•. N3•. SO4•−. Br2•−. OH. and O•−. All these radicals react with folic acid under ambient condition at an almost diffusion-controlled rate producing two types of transients. The first transient absorption maximum is around 430 nm. which decays. and a simultaneous growth at around 390 nm is observed. Considering the chemical structure of folic acid. the absorption maximum at 430 nm has been assigned to a phenoxyl radical. The latter one is proposed to be a delocalized molecular radical.

Optimized NPs showed excellent in vitro free radical scavenging activity. Skin permeation and deposition of morin from its NPs was higher than its plain form. Different sunscreen creams (SC1–SC8) were …,True,N-M93QcAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC,63,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610788/,8919580288857851563,/scholar?cites=8919580288857851563,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610788/,0,0,0
1187139,Nonlinear membership functions in multiobjective fuzzy optimization of mechanical and structural systems,1992,Anoop K Dhingra and Singiresu S Rao and Virendra Kumar,30,AIAA journal,1,251-260,,An application of fuzzy mathematical programming techniques to multiple objective design problems is presented. Two examples dealing with the multiobjective design of mechanical and structural systems are considered. The concept of a Pareto-optimal and fuzzy Pareto-optimal solution is discussed. and it is shown that the resulting formulation yields Pareto-optimal solutions. The fundamental assumption in fuzzy mathematical programming applications involving the use of linear membership functions is critically examined. Several nonlinear shapes for the membership functions of the fuzzy sets are proposed. consistent with varying perceptions of the designer. and are analyzed to determine their impact on the overall design process. These shapes correspond to what we define as the coefficient of membership satiation. It is seen that optimum designs for both examples are strongly influenced by the sign of the …,True,N-M93QcAAAAJ:WbkHhVStYXYC,57,https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/3.10906,3315623363996033548,/scholar?cites=3315623363996033548,,,0,0,0
