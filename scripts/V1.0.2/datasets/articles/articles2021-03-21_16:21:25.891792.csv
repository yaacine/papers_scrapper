The DIB-FES method employs a webcam to capture the digital images which are associated to a radiation emitted by the analyte into an air-butane flame. Since the detection by webcam is based on the RGB (red–green–blue) colour system. a novel mathematical model was developed in order to build DIB-FES analytical curves and estimate figures of merit for the proposed method. In this approach. each image is retrieved in the three R. G and B individual components and their values were used to define a position vector in RGB three-dimensional space. The norm of this vector is then adopted as the RGB-based value (analytical response) and it has revealed to be linearly related to the analyte concentration. The feasibility of the DIB-FES method is illustrated in three …,True,L882WX6QRnkC:u5HHmVD_uO8C,88,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003991400800711X,11649937742659173482,/scholar?cites=11649937742659173482,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47501952/Digital_image-based_flame_emission_spect20160725-24183-u5n6uw.pdf,0,0,0

1185391,Selective homogeneous production of alkyl formate from co and alcohol using metal carbonyl/alkoxide catalyst systems,1987,Donald J Darensbourg and Robert L Gray and Cesar Ovalles,41,Journal of molecular catalysis,3,329-347,Elsevier,The homogeneously catalyzed production of alkyl formates from alcohols and carbon monoxide by transition metal carbonyl complexes in the presence of alkali metal alkoxides is reported. A significant increase in the number of turnovers of this reaction by Group VI metal carbonyl/alkoxide catalysts over the alkali metal alkoxide-catalyzed process is due to the dual role of the metal carbonyl to provide a more electrophilic source of carbon monoxide and to promote the removal of trace water impurities through water-gas shift chemistry. The key intermediate in the proposed catalytic cycle is a short-lived metallo-ester derivative which at elevated temperatures (⪢100 °C) is protonated by alcohol to afford the alkyl formate product. The reactivity of the metal carbonyl with alkali metal alkoxides is sharply affected by the solvent system employed. e.g.. tetrahydrofuran is much more effective than alcohols.

1185394,A novel nonreactive HALS boosts polyolefin stability,1991,Robert L Gray,47,Plastics engineering,6,21-23,,A new. non-basic hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) provides stabilization in polyolefins where interactions with other components. such as halogenated flame retardants. must be minimized. This new class of HALS incorporates an alkoxyamine functional group (NOR HALS) which provides excellent light stability without adding color. Stabilization mechanisms are described. The first commercial compound is HALS-2 (Tinuvin 123) which outperforms other HALS products in the presence of brominated fire retardants. This may be linked to its low basicity and steric environment. The non-interactive nature of NOR HALS makes them suited to applications that require a degree of chemical resistance. The interaction of NOR HALS with pigments should be reduced due to its nonbasic nature and to the steric blocking of its active sites.,True,WSyJEEwAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,23,https://www.bcin.ca/bcin/detail.app?id=111323,12531936427926798335,/scholar?cites=12531936427926798335,,,0,0,0

1185410,Geometry and diameter dependence of the electronic and physical properties of GaN nanowires from first principles,2008,Damien J Carter and Julian D Gale and Bernard Delley and Catherine Stampfl,77,Physical Review B,11,115349,American Physical Society,We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the atomic and electronic structures of gallium nitride nanowires. and examine the dependence on nanowire diameter and shape. We consider nanowires in the [0001] growth direction. with diameters ranging from 8 to 35 Å. and investigate the influence of saturating the dangling bonds at the edges of nanowires. We find that unsaturated nanowires are semiconducting and contain dangling bond states in the region of the band gap. the positions of which remain rather constant with varying diameter. Saturating the nanowires with hydrogen removes these states. and the band gap decreases with increasing nanowire diameter. For the unsaturated wires there is a considerable contraction of the Ga-N bond lengths at the edge of the wires of 6.0%–7.4%. while for saturated wires it is 1.5%. We also calculate the heat of formation of the nanowires and find that as …,True,3yjYfvkAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,92,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.115349,4792295128720162846,/scholar?cites=4792295128720162846,,https://espace.curtin.edu.au/bitstream/handle/20.500.11937/8219/20528_downloaded_stream_516.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

With five crystal structures. coumarin has become one of the few rigid molecules showing extensive polymorphism at ambient conditions. We demonstrate the crucial role of advanced electronic structure calculations including many-body dispersion effects for accurate ranking of the stability of coumarin polymorphs and the need to account for anharmonic vibrational contributions to their free energy.

Using a combined theoretical and computational approach. we discuss this ‘transmutation problem’ in the context of the short-lived fission products Cs-137 and Sr-90. We show how a Kröger–Vink treatment is insufficient for understanding defects arising from transmutation. and present density functional theory data for chemical evolution within two prototypical hosts.

We quantify three key physical and chemical principles. namely momentum-induced recoil during the decay event. defect creation due to physical displacement. and chemical evolution over time. A fourth effect. that of electronic excitation. is also discussed. but this is difficult to quantify and is strongly material dependent. The analysis is presented for the specific cases of SrTiO 3 and SrH 2. By comparing the recoil energy with available threshold displacement data we show that in many beta-decay situations defects such as Frenkel pairs will not be created during decay as the energy transfer is too low.

While the Schiff base core is substituted with n-butyloxy. n-hexyloxy. n-octyloxy. n-decyloxy and n-dodecyloxy tails. three even-parity spacers. namely. 4-oxybutanoyl. 6-oxyhexanoyl. 8-oxyoctanoyl. and an odd-parity spacer. namely. 5-oxypentanoyl. have been used to join the two cores. The experimental results show that the length and parity of the spacer and the length of the terminal tail play a vital role in deciding the phase sequences of the dimers. In general. the dimers possessing an even-parity spacer display enantiotropic LC phases such as chiral nematic (N*). twist grain boundary (TGB). smectic A (SmA). chiral smectic C (SmC*) and twist grain boundary phase with SmC* slabs (TGBC*).

In aprotic medium. the oxidation mechanism of pure hydroquinone follows an ECE sequence under a mixed kinetic control by electron and proton transfer. When a strong acid is present in the medium. the stabilization of the radical cation generated in the first oxidation step allows a mechanistic transition from ECE to DISP2. The oxidation mechanism is also sensitive to the presence of weak and strong hydrogen bonding acceptors. such as dimethylsulfoxide and the acetate ion. Under these conditions. the oxidation is less anodic. which can be explained by formation of association complexes in which proton transfer is possible after the electron transfer. It is shown that the oxidation wave observed in typical experiments of quinones in the presence of proton donors is attributed to …,True,aoo9t00AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,84,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072807001155,2823824528654895351,/scholar?cites=2823824528654895351,,,0,0,0

This compound can form stable 1:1 complexes in acetonitrile solution with halides (F−. Cl−. Br−. and I−) and nitrate (NO3−) anions. The main binding site in the receptor is on the cleft and recognition occurs through a series of co-operative hydrogen bonding interactions including intramolecular hydrogen bonds which stabilizes the co-planar conformation of the host–guest complex.

Spectroscopic studies show that phenoxathiin is an effective template for β-sheet formation allowing even weak hydrogen acceptors such as ester amides to exist almost exclusively in intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded conformations. Replacing the phenoxathiin derivative with flexible hydrocarbon chains results in substantial loss of intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Solid state FTIR of the polymers revealed that the expected parallel β-sheets were retained in the polymer solely due to the presence of the rigid phenoxathiin template. Conformationally unrestricted units incapable of inducing sheet formation provide mostly random coils and …,True,kqx6TwMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,76,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma960804s,5504614623124532673,/scholar?cites=5504614623124532673,,,0,0,0

1185531,Mechanical failure of bent optical fiber subjected to high power,2006,G Scott Glaesemann and Michael J Winningham and Donald A Clark and Jeffrey Coon and Steven E DeMartino and Stephan L Logunov and Ching‐Kee Chien,89,Journal of the American Ceramic Society,1,50-56,Blackwell Science Inc, As optical fiber penetrates further into the communications infrastructure and comes closer to the home or business. higher optical power levels are expected. Several studies have shown that sharply bent optical fiber will fail prematurely when exposed to high optical power levels. In an extreme case. where the fiber is bent to a maximum bend stress on the order of 2 GPa and subjected to a power level of 1–2 W in the near‐infrared wavelength window. optical fiber will fail in minutes. Time to failure decreases with increasing bend stress and optical power. A recent report suggests that power levels in the range of a few hundred milliwatts may be enough to induce delayed failure in bent fiber. This study explores the progression of events leading to failure. Light that escapes the core of bent fiber passes into the coating. where a small amount is absorbed and converted to heat. The coating heats to a stable …,True,kqx6TwMAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,16,https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1551-2916.2005.00716.x,1007581993672836784,/scholar?cites=1007581993672836784,,,0,0,0

The n-Hex. EtOAc. and MeOH–H2O fractions of the woods inhibited cell proliferation in both cell lines. Our phytochemical investigation of the n-Hex and EtOAc fractions led to the isolation of lignans and phenylpropanoids. whose chemical structures were confirmed by spectroscopic analyses. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antileukemic activity; especially. hinokinin and cubebin exhibited strong inhibition toward U937 cell proliferation. Morphological observation indicated that these cytotoxic actions were mediated by apoptosis. Our findings suggested that an oxygenated functional group at the C-9 position in dibenzylfuran skeleton contributed their potency.

Li-rich manganese-rich oxide (xLi2MnO3·(1 − x)LiMO2. M = transition metals) is one of the few materials that might meet such a requirement. but it suffers from poor energy retention due to serious voltage and/or capacity fade. which challenges its applications. Here we show that this challenge can be addressed by optimizing the interactions between the components Li2MnO3 and LiMO2 in the Li-rich oxide (i.e. stabilizing the layered structure through Li2MnO3 and controlling Li2MnO3 activation through LiMO2). To realize this synergistic effect. a novel Li2MnO3-stabilized Li1.080Mn0.503Ni0.387Co0.030O2 was designed and prepared using a hierarchical carbonate precursor obtained by a solvo/hydro-thermal method.

In this work. the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8). one of metal-organic framework material. is initially coated on the surface of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM333). After ZIF-8 coating. the cycling stability and rate capability of NCM333@ZIF-8 are simultaneously improved in comparison with that of NCM333. A high capacity retention ratio of 81.4% is achieved after 300 cycles at 800 mA g−1. which is much larger than that of NCM333 (41.2%). Even at an elevated temperature (55 °C). the cycling stability of NCM333@ZIF-8 is still excellent. In addition. a high capacity of 122 mA h g−1 is obtained at a high current density of 1200 mA g−1.

The relationship between the carbon shell thickness and the anode performance of the MnO/C materials was discussed. With a suitable carbon shell thickness(6.8 nm). the MnO/C core-shell nanowires exhibit better cycling and rate performance than those with a smaller or larger thickness. The TEM results show that after 50 cycles. the core-shell structure with this thickness can be retained. which leads to superior performance.

Based on these findings a stripping analytical method was developed for the detection of propofol in acidic solutions …,True,EZdzXX0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,28,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267011010774,17039674166029134538,/scholar?cites=17039674166029134538,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42662493/Electrochemical_quantification_of_26-dii20160213-32524-1sq5aay.pdf,0,0,0

The analysis considers the influence of the chemical and the electrochemical kinetics as well as the contribution of sphericity to the voltammetric responses. The apparent electrode sphericity and the global apparent reversibility are jointly affected by the variation of frequency (f). If the electrode radius (ro) is smaller than 30 μm. but the sphericity contribution is neglected. it is not possible to obtain good kinetic information. For Esw>0.2 V the system is shifted far from the steady-state and the kchem value can be analysed regardless of the ks value. However. for Esw=50 mV. it is not possible to evaluate kchem if ks≤10−3 or K>1. Simple equations for the dependence of ΔΨp on f. ro and Esw have been provided.

However. the response-time of this kind of sensors is typically slow because reagents and products have to diffuse through filtering membranes and the enzymatic matrix.

To achieve this. the hyperbranched polymer Boltorn H40 (BH40) has been self-assembled at the surface of MWNTs.

The central transformation of this process is an Ugi four-component reaction generating the peptidomimetic core structure. In order to avoid exposure to the often toxic and malodorous isocyanide building blocks. the continuous approach was telescoped by the dehydration of the corresponding formamide. In a concurrent operation. the highly energetic azide moiety required for the subsequent intramolecular copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (Click reaction) was installed by nucleophilic substitution from a bromide precursor.

Using two-dimensional exchange NMR. it is possible to determine the microscopic rates of intercage motion and to relate them to the adsorption and activation energies of the xenon atoms. The dependence of the adsorption energies on xenon cage occupancy reflects the importance of the intracage interactions and is directly related to the cage occupancy distribution.

This treatment is shown to account for the observed spectral behavior of 15N and 31P nuclei coupled to Mn2+ in a GDP complex with the protein N‐ras p21. The treatment involves the decomposition of the multilevel electron spin system into a set of noninteracting two level systems. an approximation that is valid when the dispersed EPR spectral width is large compared to the microwave excitation bandwidth. The consequent spectral selectivity of the microwave excitation is accounted for. in ESEEM simulations. by attaching a weight to the ESEEM subspectra associated with each EPR transition. and calculating the total ESEEM spectrum as a weighted superposition of the subspectra.

1185689,Elements of Success: Supporting at-risk student resilience through learning analytics,2020,Jae-Eun Russell and Anna Smith and Russell Larsen,152,Computers & Education,,103890,Pergamon,Strategies that incorporate learning analytics are continuing to advance as higher education institutions work to promote student success. Although many of the early learning analytics applications were intended to help teaching professionals to identify at-risk students. some learning analytics applications display information on course progress and performance directly to students. While positive associations between student use of learning analytics and achievement have been reported. some have expressed concern that for at-risk students. low estimated grades might induce negative emotions. which could lead to disengagement or even withdrawal.

The activity of MeAPO-5 catalysts follows the order of SiAPO>MgAPO>MnAPO>ZnAPO>CoAPO which can be correlated with the acid properties of catalysts. The same correlation was found for MeAPSO-5 catalysts. The strength of acid sites of the catalyst influences the competition among various reactions that occur during the transalkylation process. Generally. the transalkylation and/or disproportionation reactions occur on stronger acid sites. while the isomerization of xylenes (Xs) and TMBs predominate on weaker acid sites.,True,cfPpAgcAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,56,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926860X02003290,8871275070929522824,/scholar?cites=8871275070929522824,,,0,0,0

In our work we used one of the most efficient advanced wastewater treatment. the Fenton reaction and its photo-assisted version. The hydrogen peroxide was the oxidizer; despite its relatively high cost. its high activity in oxidizing of a large variety of organic persistent pollutants in the presence of Fe3+ ions as catalyst. makes it an alternative which is worth to be considered even in practical medium scale systems. The Fenton and photo-Fenton oxidation were performed using a model dye. the xanthene-type Rhodamine 6G. widely used in a series of biotechnology applications. but having major drawbacks when released in natural water flows. mainly mutagen and carcinogen effects. Therefore. a parametric case study was performed in order to define the optimal operating parameters (the pH value. the hydrogen peroxide concentration and the iron catalyst concentration). The oxidative degradation of Rhodamine 6G by Fenton reaction was more effective when combined with UV irradiation. Each parameter of the oxidative treatment is essential for the color and TOC removal. The optimal values found for the total color degradation and mineralization of the dye were as follows: 16 ppm Fe3+. 100 ppm H2O2 and pH of 4.5.,True,cfPpAgcAAAAJ:RHpTSmoSYBkC,14,http://www.eemj.icpm.tuiasi.ro/pdfs/vol14/no3/full/13_1007_Simion_14.pdf,14506694733410535582,/scholar?cites=14506694733410535582,,http://www.eemj.icpm.tuiasi.ro/pdfs/vol14/no3/full/13_1007_Simion_14.pdf,0,0,0

While titanium dioxide is one of the most used solids as photocatalyst. silver is particularly interesting for applications in biological and chemical detection and for its antibacterial properties. Moreover. in photocatalysis silver acts as an electron sink and donor in capturing the photogenerated electrons. The structural and morphological properties of the TiO2-Ag samples were investigated by XRD. SEM. TEM. SAED and EDAX. The crystallinity degree increased by calcination at 650 C and the nature of the phases changed from anatase to a mixture of anatase. rutile and silver in metallic form and silver oxide. The photocatalytic properties of the synthesized product were evaluated in the UV-assisted photodegradation of Rhodamine 6G and Methyl Blue dyes.

For comparison. the cobalt was highly dispersed within the channels of mesoporous MnMCM-48 samples by impregnation approach. The prepared mesoporous materials were characterized by physico-chemical techniques. including SEM. TEM. N2 sorption. XRD. XPS. and elemental analysis. The physico-chemical characterization revealed that all of the samples retained a high surface area and regular cubic mesoporosity and that the manganese. cobalt and cobalt-manganese were highly dispersed. The catalytic activities of these samples were studied with respect to the conversion of methylcyclopentane (MCP) in reductive media as a function of the reaction temperature (150-500 C). Irrespective of the temperature of reaction. the MnMCM-48 mesoporous samples did not exhibit catalytic activity. which suggests that the electrophilic manganese oxygen species. operative over all the samples. were inactive sites for the conversion of MCP. The addition of cobalt favored catalytic activity. A symbiotic process between the MnMCM-48 support and the Co nanoparticles likely occurs as reveals the catalytic tests.

The process for forming the structure involves coating a first relatively thin photosensitive layer on a substrate or carrier film. then forming a second relatively thicker photosensitive layer (when compared to the first layer) on the first layer. The structure is exposed by directing appropriate actinic radiation against the substrate. film or carrier layer under controlled conditions such that only the first layer is substantially exposed to radiation resulting in polymerization or crosslinking and a substantial reduction in the solubility of the first layer. The relatively thinner less soluble layer then acts as a peelable integral release layer in the photosensitive structure.

One of the peculiar features of this reaction is the preferential formation of anti-Markovnikov's adducts for the additions to unsymmetrical alkenes. Thus for the addition of RSHal to propene ('l. R= H). or 2-methylpropene ('l. R= CH3) the ratio of M: aM/2/was found to be: 32: 68 (R= H. Ar= C6Hg. Hal= C1/3a/); 38: 62 (R= H. Ar= 4-C1C6H4. Hal= C1/3b/); 23: 77 (R= H. Ar= 2. 4. 6-(CH3) 3C6H2.

However. the sulfur content present in GO prepared by Hummers’ method has only been addressed by a few authors so far. It has been reported that hydrolysis of sulfur species takes place and that stable sulfonic groups are present in graphite oxide. In this manuscript. in contrast to earlier reports. sulfate species are identified that are covalently bound to GO and still present after extensive aqueous work‐up. Additionally. we exclude the possibility that sulfonic groups are present in GO as major species after aqueous work up. Our results are based on bulk characterization of graphene oxide by thermogravimetry and subsequent analysis of the decomposition products using mass spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy.

In this combined density-functional theory and experimental study. we investigate this reduction with respect to differences occurring between tubes of different electronic type (metallic (m) and semiconducting (sc) tubes. respectively). We find that metals. specifically potassium. adsorb stronger to m- than sc-SWCNTs. which can be explained by the different band structures of both tube types. We investigate this trend in detail for a variety of different chiral SWCNTs. finding a potassium coverage dependent preference of m- over sc-SWCNTs. which is predicted to allow for a selective charging of metallic tubes for K/C ratios ≤ 1/200.

Q. ilex and P. granatum extracts gave 100% precipitation of ovine haemoglobin in vitro. whereas A. herba‐alba extract was devoid of any protein‐binding property. Oral administration of these plant extracts or tannic acid induced a significant decrease in gastric lesions (47.7%–76%). The observed protection was more pronounced when the test solution was given at the same time with ethanol. except for Q. ilex extract. The acid content of the stomach was significantly increased by P. granatum (368%) and A. herba‐alba (251%) extracts prepared in ethanol. It is suggested that monomeric and polymeric polyphenols can strengthen the gastric mucosal barrier.

Phenolic acids (10. 25 and 50 µg/ml) inhibited lipid peroxidation by 42–51%. Caffeic acid seems to be the most potent inhibitor among phenolic acids. Tannic acid. a commercially available tannin. inhibited lipid peroxidation in the same manner as phenolic acids. The inhibition did not exceed 43%. Catechin and quercetin significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation at all tested concentrations and the percentages of inhibition varied between 38 and 60%. However. flavonoid glycosides (rutin and diosmin) did not behave in the same way. Quercus purified tannins showed high inhibition of lipid peroxidation.

This effect was accompanied by a marked pH-dependent reduction of titratable acidity of the lumen. The amount of Alcian blue bound to adherent mucus was reduced in a pH-independent manner by sodium fluoride.

1185832,Undecaphenylcorroles,2012,Steffen Berg and Kolle E Thomas and Christine M Beavers and Abhik Ghosh,51,Inorganic chemistry,18,9911-9916,American Chemical Society,A first major study of undecaphenylcorrole (UPC) derivatives is presented. Three different Cu-UPC derivatives with different para substituents X (X = CF3. H. CH3) on the β-aryl groups were synthesized via Suzuki–Miyaura coupling of Cu[Br8TPC] and the appropriate arylboronic acid. A single-crystal X-ray structure of the X = CF3 complex revealed a distinctly saddled macrocycle conformation with adjacent pyrrole rings tilted by ∼60–66° relative to one another (within the dipyrromethane units). which is somewhat higher than that observed for β-unsubstituted Cu-TPC derivatives but slightly lower than that observed for Cu[Br8TPC] (∼70°) derivatives. Electrochemical and electronic absorption measurements afforded some of the first comparative insights into meso versus β substituent effects on the copper corrole core. The Soret maxima of the Cu-UPC complexes (∼440–445 nm). however. are comparable to those …,True,iip0PyAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,57,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic301388e,1035050934951823289,/scholar?cites=1035050934951823289,,,0,0,0

The saddling is enhanced by sterically hindered peripheral substituents. The sterically hindered complex Cu[(CF3)8T(pFP)C] (wherein the ligand is β-octakis(trifluoromethyl)-meso-tris(p-fluorophenyl)corrolato) is thus exceedingly saddled with adjacent pyrrole rings nearly orthogonal to one another.

Reported herein is a superior procedure for demetalating copper corroles with concentrated H2SO4 and 5-200 equiv FeCl2 or SnCl2. The yields obtained with this reductive procedure are generally substantially better than with CHCl3/H2SO4. CH2Cl2/H2SO4. or H2SO4 alone. With an oxidation-prone metallocorrole such as Cu[T(p-OMeP)C]. the reductive protocol was essential for obtaining any measurable yield of the free base at all. Free-base β-octabromo-meso-triarylcorroles were also obtained in pure form. in good yields. and with relative ease via this procedure.,True,iip0PyAAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,38,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1088424608000340,3408028798809499150,/scholar?cites=3408028798809499150,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f291/c2d630329353869977e0b74940d91a1a1336.pdf,0,0,0

A crystal structure of a copper β‐octakis(trifluoromethyl)‐meso‐triarylcorrole. however. has revealed a corrole macrocycle with an unprecedented degree of saddling. With the exception of the bipyrrole unit. any two adjacent pyrrole rings are essentially orthogonal to each other. Furthermore. the C2‐symmetric molecular structure is chiral and NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations suggest that the enantiomers do not interconvert readily.
