Glance at a handful of key sources. and they all seem to tell the story of a battle: in the years between the two world wars the Australian art establishment was run by a band of big bad traditionalists—art historian Bernard Smith likens them to the priests of Leviticus—who were at first irritated and later seriously threatened by a bunch of critical young innovators. The story of the emergence of modern art in Australia seems to be about the victory of the innovators. It is something of an historical trope that'it is the victors who write history'. 1 Four key art histories in one way or another present this story of victory: Australian Painting by Bernard Smith; Rebels and Precursors by Richard Haese; The Innovators by Geoffrey Dutton; and The Black Swan of Trespassby Humphrey McQueen. 2 In the victory story. women modernists appear as marginal …,True,_Z_hJN4AAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC,9,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14443050309387913,14885459091573389984,/scholar?cites=14885459091573389984,,http://api-network.com/main/pdf/scholars/jas80_hunt.pdf,0,0,0

1079952,Cultivating the arts: Sydney women culturists 1900-50,2001,Jane Elizabeth Hunt,,,,,Australia: Macquarie University,In Australian cultural studies a focus on radical nationalists. male intellectuals. class-based cultural constructions and popular culture has steered the general historiography away from the subject of women and culture. Feminist cultural histories in Australia have tended to focus on practitioners. particularly women writers. and have set out to recover lost or unknown cultural heroines. develop exclusionist theories. or argue for a feminine aesthetic. This thesis considers the actions of both female practitioners and supporters of the arts. and suggests that despite numerous intersecting interests some continuity may be discerned in the actions of women culturists in Sydney in the first half of the twentieth century. Two key factors united them: the application of learned feminine behaviours in the patronage of culturally oriented individuals and movements. and an acceptance of the sort of distinctions that nineteenth century British discussions on culture had generated.This thesis examines through a series of case studies the work of practitioners in the arts. individual patrons or supporters of particular artists or cultural groups. and networks of supporters. It explores the dynamics of respective movements initiated or driven by women within musical. artistic. literary and theatrical circles. and in the wider community of the culturally concerned. This wider circle. driven by the mid-Victorian ideal of cultural custodianship. was concerned with the pursuit of cultural excellence and the'civilising'arts.

Six bacterial phenotypes had been previously isolated as the most predominant microorganisms in carpet shell clam (Tapes decussates) samples collected from natural beds in representative Egyptian clam fisheries. The main aims of this study were to investigate the nature of the pathogenic strains that significantly affect clam survival and test their susceptibility to commercially available antibiotics. Based on their 16S rRNA sequences and some biochemical features. two potent clam pathogens were emerged; one of which is gram-positive and the other is gram-negative. The former isolate was identified as Micrococcus luteus and the latter as Vibrio alginolyticus. Experimental challenges with the two bacterial pathogens introduced at different initial cell concentrations (2.5 X 104-7.5 X 104 cfu ml-1) showed markedly diverse clam mortality results. However. the pathogenic interaction of M. luteus with clam survival was generally higher than that of V. alginolyticus. When introduced at a relatively low initial cell density. the infectious records of V. alginolyticus were significantly increased suggesting that the expression of its key virulence factors is mainly triggered as a response to host contact. Antibiotic susceptibility tests suggested chloramphenicol and tetracycline as markedly effective agents that can be used to control the spread of these two bacterial pathogens in aquaculture applications.,True,CLNGougAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,3,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/376784,8274188522691657365,/scholar?cites=8274188522691657365,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/376784,0,0,0

Boone 1931.,,JB Ellamar and EJC Ocampo and LL Ilag,,,,,,Fermentation-biotechnology to produce high-protein agricultural biomass with potential as a feed ingredient is well-established. However. practical applicability of this technology in aquaculture has not been fully realized. The present work evaluates the nutritional and feed value of fermented sweet potato meal (ProEn-KTM) to replace soybean meal in the diet of juvenile Penaeus vannamei. Four experimental diets containing graded levels of ProEn-KTM replacing 0 (%). 25 (%). 50 (%) and 100 (%) of soybean meal were formulated and fed to P. vannamei for 8 weeks. Results showed that 100 (%) of soybean meal can be replaced by fermented sweet potato and 50 (%) replacement elicited growth promoting effects. Survival. feed conversion. and body composition were similar in all treatments. Dietary inclusion of fermented sweet potato promotes better ratio of the n-3/n-6 fatty acid and lowers the total gut bacteria as well as total Vibrio. Collectively these results suggest that fermented sweet potato meal could fully replace soybean meal in P. vannamei diet. The use of this feed ingredient is a practical approach to meet the increasing needs of proteins in feeds for the expansion and sustainability of P. vannamei aquaculture.,True,rsT39iMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rex_Traifalgar/publication/333386541_Fermented_Sweet_Potato_Meal_a_Sustainable_Dietary_Protein_Ingredient_for_Juvenile_Penaeus_vannamei/links/5cea754d458515712ec3bac4/Fermented-Sweet-Potato-Meal-a-Sustainable-Dietary-Protein-Ingredient-for-Juvenile-Penaeus-vannamei.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rex_Traifalgar/publication/333386541_Fermented_Sweet_Potato_Meal_a_Sustainable_Dietary_Protein_Ingredient_for_Juvenile_Penaeus_vannamei/links/5cea754d458515712ec3bac4/Fermented-Sweet-Potato-Meal-a-Sustainable-Dietary-Protein-Ingredient-for-Juvenile-Penaeus-vannamei.pdf,0,0,0

There are many plants in Albania that cause this disease and Humulus lupulus (Cannabaceae) is one of them. In this study is presented an allergopalynologic description of pollen grains of this plant. They were taken in the Elbasan region of Albania and are studied for the first time by the local researchers. The slides were prepared using two methods: acetolysis and basic fuchsine method. The results have shown that the pollen grains of H. lupulus were triporate. Also. is done the comparison of the size of pollen grains for the specie studied with others from foreign literature that belong to different habitats. The study showed the pollen grains of H. lupulus taken in Elbasan area have similarities to the morphological features with H. lupulus' pollen according to the foreign literature. but they differ from their size. By our study. it turns out that the pollen grains of H. hupulus from Elbasan habitat have smaller sizes than those obtained from the literature. We conclude that the change in the size of pollen grains caused by environmental factors and the chosen method during processing laboratory.,True,EPm2ytYAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,1,http://siba-ese.unisalento.it/index.php/thalassiasal/article/view/19505,14231043786468199635,/scholar?cites=14231043786468199635,,http://siba-ese.unisalento.it/index.php/thalassiasal/article/viewFile/19505/16615,0,0,0

This study aims to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oil (EO) extracted from ripe berries of Algerian Juniperus thurifera var. aurasiaca. Methods: The chemical composition of J. thurifera EO extracted by hydrodistillation was analyzed by using the GC-MS technique. Antibacterial activity of EO alone and in combination with three conventional antibiotics was assessed by using disc diffusion method against four bacterial strains. Results: Thirty-five components were identified. representing~ 87% of the oil. The main components were m-mentha-6. 8-diene (15.43%). β-pinene (10.59%). elemol (8.31%) and terpinene-4-ol (7.44%). The essential oil showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli. but no activity against P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis. Synergistic effects were observed because of the combined application of EO with gentamicin against all strains tested. and with amoxicillin against B. subtilis. Furthermore. the combination of EO/cefazolin demonstrated an additive effect against B. subtilis. In contrast. the combination of EO with amoxicillin and céfazoline revealed antagonistic effects against S. aureus. E. coli. and P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: This is the first report on the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Algerian juniper berries’ essential oil.

Many of the trap-nesting wasps are important predators of common crop pests. and cavity-nesting bees that utilize trap-nests are important pollinators for native plants and many crops. The impact of wildflower strips on the nesting frequency of trap-nesting wasps or bees within localized areas has not been thoroughly investigated. Trap-nests made of bamboo reeds (Bambusa sp.) were placed adjacent to eight 0.1 ha wildflower plots and paired fallow areas (control plots) to determine if wildflower strips encourage the nesting of wasps and bees. From August 2014 to November 2015. occupied reeds were gathered and adults were collected as they emerged from the trap-nests. Treatment (wildflower or fallow plots) did not impact the number of occupied reeds or species richness of trap-nesting wasps using the occupied reeds. The wasps Pachodynerus erynnis. Euodynerus megaera. Parancistrocerus pedestris. and Isodontia spp. were the most common trap-nesting species collected. Less than 2% of the occupied reeds contained bees. and all were from the genus Megachile. The nesting wasp and bee species demonstrated preferences for reeds with certain inside diameters (IDs). The narrow range of ID preferences exhibited by each bee/wasp may provide opportunities to take advantage of their natural histories for biological control and/or pollination purposes.

When trophic and saprobic levels are controlled. it is possible to identify the effects of herbicides on some metrics. The only responding metric is the abundance of the “high profile” guild. which corresponds to taxa presenting an important contact surface with water flow. Its abundance decreases when herbicide toxic pressure increases. It could therefore be used to assess the impact of herbicides on diatom communities. but in a framework where confounding factors variability (e.g.. nutrients. organic matter. river order) is reduced.,True,aisjUsgAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/1264550,,,,,0,0,0

In 2010 the French government adopted a plan for a 50% reduction over 10 years in the use of pesticides which promotes research on contamination monitoring. Diatom bio-indication tools in rivers have been standardized and normalized (AFNOR NFT 90 354; CEN–EN 13946 & EN 14407) and are adapted to assess nutrient and organic matter levels. However these indicators do not assess micropollutants contamination despite diatoms being known to be sensitive to pesticide pollution. The objective of this study is to assess whether bio-indicators based on diatom communities could be developed to assess the impact of pesticide contamination. especially herbicides. on freshwater ecosystems quality. The hypothesis that increasing herbicide concentration reduces diatom diversity wastested on a diatom data set from the French Water Framework Directive monitoring network. The data set includes more than 2000 samples from 14 ecoregions from eastern France over the period 2000-2008. To each sample corresponds a list of diatom taxa and 531micropollutants (herbicides. insecticides. fungicides. heavy metals and organic micropollutants) concentration measurements.

The HBsAg level varies in different genotypes and phases of infection. Therefore. we aimed to investigate the serum HBsAg level and its correlation with HBV DNA in different phases of Vietnamese CHB patients. predominately infected with genotype B and C. 267 chronic HBV treatment naïve patients (156 genotype B and 61 genotype C) were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Patients were categorized to 5 groups: immune tolerance (IT). HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B (CHBe+). inactive carrier (IC). viral reactivation (VR). HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B (CHBe-). The serum HBsAg level was measured by ECLIA method. Correlations between HBsAg and HBV DNA were analyzed by Spearman's correlation.

Urbana. IL 61801,In order to understand and resolve the disproportionate number of women in the sciences it is necessary to look at historical educational trends. Through the ages there is evidence of a'pendulum effect'where there have been major shifts focusing science education either on male or females. To be able to realistically establish sustainable equity in the natural and life sciences it is necessary to reexamine not only the curriculum verbiage used in the text but also teaching styles that are used to present the material. One approach is introducing more hands-on learning to supplement the'banking'approach traditionally used in introductory science classes. Handson learning engages visual. kinesthetic as well as auditory pathways and allows students to move from abstract thinking to dealing with the concrete. While there have been numerous studies done. they have historically focused on the effect of hands-on learning in K-12 schools. There is still much research that needs to be done on all types of science curriculum. especially at the post secondary level. We conducted several studies at Saint Xavier University with students in the Introductory Biology and Women in Science Courses. We examined the effects of various pedagogies on class performance in a nonmajors science course. We examined the effects of no labs. a few labs or weekly labs on student performance. Significant improvements were seen within sexes (10%). and with female students (13%). while male students showed modest improvement (2%).

Normal meiotic events lead to the formation of normal tetrads and normal pollen while abnormal meiosis results in abnormal segregation of chromosomes in the tetrads resulting in macro and micropollen. Thus. pollen size can be used as an indirect measure of meiotic integrity. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of micropollen from putative F1. BC1. and BC2 progeny of waterhemp and smooth pigweed crosses to determine if infertility in the hybrids could be attributed to abnormal meiosis. Significant variation was observed with respect to the occurrence of micropollen. The F1 hybrids had the highest occurrence of micropollen. and highest percentage of abnormal tetrad formation. Problems in meiosis could be causing decreased fertility. but not complete sterility. However. backcrossing resulted in progeny with smaller percentages of micropollen. consistent with previous reports that fertility is restored in these progeny.

Série Zoologia,,,Museu de Ciências Naturais,Species tend to be less abundant at the limits of their geographic distribution. Giant and lesser anteaters have their southernmost limits in Argentina and Paraguay. where scarce information exists regarding their ecology and conservation. We present a study carried out in the Paraguay River floodplain. in an area dedicated to cattle rearing using native grasses in a subtropical flooded savanna associated with naturally occurring forest islets. wetlands and palm groves. Using camera-traps within three different forest types. we estimated parameters related to habitat preference. social behavior and activity patterns of both species. Results show that capture success was greater in the Floodable sub-humid forest islets (FSF). compared to other types of forests: Riparian forests associated with wetlands (W-RF) and Mesoxerophytic semi-deciduous forests dominated by Schinopsis balansae (MXF). Most detections corresponded to solitary anteaters. although mother-young pairs were occasionally observed during summer. Both species showed a nocturnal and crepuscular activity pattern with a peak of records around midnight. Myrmecophaga tridactyla was detected between 11°C and 26°C. while Tamandua tetradactyla occurred between 15°C and 23°C.

Therefore. rapid. accurate. and early diagnosis of HPV for successful treatment is essential. The present study describes the development of a selective and sensitive electrochemical biosensor base on DNA. for early detection of HPV-18. For this purpose. a nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were electrodeposited on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Then. Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) were dropped on a modified SPCE. Subsequently. single strand DNA (ssDNA) probe was immobilized on the modified electrode. The link attached between AuNPs and probe ssDNA provided by l-cysteine via functionalizing AuNPs (Cys-AuNPs). The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) assay was also used to electrochemical measurement. The measurement was based on the oxidation signals of anthraquninone-2-sulfonic acid monohydrate sodium salt (AQMS) before and after hybridization between the probe and target DNA. The calibration curve showed a linear range between 0.01 fM to 0.01 nM with a limit of detection 0.05 fM. The results showed that the optimum concentration for DNA probe was 5 µM.

The disease is caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). Both have a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA genome with a 5’ covalently-linked viral protein. which functionally resembles the cap structure of mRNA. binds to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) or its analogues. and then enable the translation of viral genomic RNA in host cells. To characterize cassava eIF4Es and their potential role in CBSD tolerance and susceptibility. we cloned five eIF4E transcripts from cassava (accession TMS60444). Sequence analysis indicated that the cassava eIF4E family of proteins consisted of one eIF4E. two eIF(iso)4E. and two divergent copies of novel cap-binding proteins (nCBPs). Our data demonstrated experimentally the coding of these five genes as annotated in the published cassava genome and provided additional evidence for refined annotations. Illumina resequencing data of the five eIF4E genes were analyzed from 14 cassava lines tolerant or susceptible to CBSD. Abundant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and biallelic variations were observed in the eIF4E genes; however. most of the SNPs were located in the introns and non-coding regions of the exons.

N1-methylguanosine-37 and N1-methylinosine-37 in tRNAs. both located at the 3’-adjacent to the anticodon. are formed by Trm5. Here we describe Arabidopsis thaliana AtTRM5 (At3g56120) as a Trm5 ortholog. Attrm5 mutant plants have overall slower growth as observed by slower leaf initiation rate. delayed flowering and reduced primary root length. In Attrm5 mutants. mRNAs of flowering time genes are less abundant and correlated with delayed flowering. We show that AtTRM5 complements the yeast trm5 mutant. and in vitro methylates tRNA guanosine-37 to produce N1-methylguanosine (m1G). We also show in vitro that AtTRM5 methylates tRNA inosine-37 to produce N1-methylinosine (m1I) and in Attrm5 mutant plants. we show a reduction of both N1-methylguanosine and N1-methylinosine. We also show that AtTRM5 is localized to the nucleus in plant cells. Proteomics data showed that photosynthetic protein abundance is affected in Attrm5 mutant plants. Finally. we show tRNA-Ala aminoacylation is not affected in Attrm5 mutants. However the abundance of tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Asp 5’ half cleavage products are deduced.

The emphasis is on community-level consumption in rural areas of developing countries with respect to the amount and type of biomass resource consumed and that available for project activities. Chapter sections examine suitable assessment methods. appropriate analysis and the assessment of availability of appropriate resources for satisfactory formulation of a bioenergy project. Indicators of changes in biomass consumption over time. which may alter the amount of biomass resource available for future project sustainability. are also examined. Two examples of surveys designed and implemented at community level are given. One example. of a survey designed and implemented in the field (by the non-governmental organization Alofa Tuvalu1) to assess biomass consumption in Tuvalu. will be used to illustrate some of the issues discussed in this chapter. The second example is from a research thesis (by Singh. 2013) that focuses on field research in two communities in Vanuatu and three communities in Tuvalu. Initially. survey design and implementation will be examined since surveys are important tools in determining biomass consumption patterns. Analysis of domestic energy consumption will be investigated because the domestic sector is responsible for a very large proportion of biomass consumption.

MANAGING AND CONTROLLING ENERGY SOURCES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: A GENDER ANALYSIS ACROSS COMMUNITIES IN VANUATU AND TUVALU,2013,Ranjila Devi Singh,,,,,,How people access. use and manage critical livelihood resources. such as fuelwood. is complex and dynamic. While research has been undertaken to better understand these complexities. scant attention has been paid to the differences between how men and women access. use and manage natural resources to sustain their livelihood. In the Pacific. this is no exception; research that employs a gender analysis to better grapple with issues concerning sustainable resource use and how current ways of living intertwine with debates about climate change mitigation is in its infancy. This thesis draws on research conducted in Piliura and Tassiriki villages in Vanuatu and Vaiaku. Senala and Tumaseu villages in Tuvalu. which entailed a mixed-methodology of household surveys. focus groups. an inventory of household fuelwood consumption and vegetation quadrants. Analysis reveals that management of household lighting at Vanuatu and Tuvalu sites is mainly done by men in comparison to women. Decisionmaking in terms of the type. time invested and use of lighting is also determined by men. while household cooking is the responsibility of women. In Vanuatu sites fuelwood is the main source of energy used for cooking on indoor stoves. which can have a negative and inequitable health impact on women. While in Tuvalu natural gas was the major source of energy for household cooking. In Vanuatu the source of energy for household cooking was managed by 57.1 percent of women and 42.9 percent of men.

To provide new insights into interactive molecular responses to heat stress combined with virus infection in potato. we analysed expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins [markers of salicylic acid (SA)-mediated plant defence] and heat shock proteins (HSPs). in two potato cultivars that differ in tolerance to elevated temperatures and in susceptibility to potato virus Y (PVY). In plants of cv. Chicago (thermosensitive and PVY-susceptible). increased temperature reduced PR gene expression and this correlated with enhancement of PVY infection (virus accumulation and symptom production). In contrast. with cv. Gala (thermotolerant and PVY resistant). which displayed a greater increase in PR gene expression in response to PVY infection. temperature affected neither PR transcript levels nor virus accumulation. HSP genes were induced by elevated temperature in both cultivars but to higher levels in the thermotolerant (Gala) cultivar. PVY infection did not alter expression of HSP genes in the Gala cultivar (possibly because of the low level of virus accumulation) but did induce expression of HSP70 and HSP90 in the susceptible cultivar (Chicago). These findings suggest that responses to heat stress and PVY infection in potato have some common underlying mechanisms. which may be integrated in a specific consolidated network that controls plant sensitivity to multiple stresses in a cultivar-specific manner.

1080134,Comparative proteomic analysis of two potato varieties under biotic and complex stresses,2019,N Spechenkova and A Mamaeva and I Fesenko and N Kalinina and V Zgoda and M Taliansky,9,,,308-308,WILEY,The study of plant resistance mechanisms to biotic and abiotic stresses is one of a problem in plant breeding. In order to determine changes in biological pathways induced by individual and complex stresses. we performed proteomic profiling of two potato varieties differ in resistance to heat stress (28 C) and infection with potato virus Y (PVY)–cultivars Gala (resistant genotype) and Chicago (susceptible genotype). Label-free quantification and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approaches were used for quantitative proteomic analysis. The proteome of susceptible genotype (cv. Chicago) showed a weak response to both an individual (viral infection or heat stress) and complex stresses. In contrast. nuclear proteins such as calreticulin. small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein E were up-regulated in resistant genotype (cv. Gala). snRNPs are known to be involved in a spliceosome assembly and can be functionally linked to another nuclear protein–fibrillarin. In addition. the abundance of a number of ribosomal proteins. acidic class II 1.3-beta-glucanases. multicystatin and antioxidant enzymes have also been increased. We also detected that proteins of the primary metabolism. such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase A. plastocyanin and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase were down-regulated in resistant genotype. The further studies are needed to determine the contribution of the most promising protein targets to establish of resistant to complex stresses. This work was supported by Research Grant No. 14.

Indications for early (n = 749) and late (n = 508) HR were similar. Early HR (OR: 3.80. P = .007) and black race (OR: 2.38. P = .009) were associated with higher odds of 1‐year graft failure while frequency (1‐2. 3‐4. 5+) of HR (ORs: 4.68. 8.36. 9.44. P < .001) and age > 50 (OR: 2.11.

1080151,Comparing the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test With Varying Number of Groups to the Calibration Belt in Logistic Regression Models,2016,Jason A Benedict,,,,,,Logistic regression is a commonly used statistical technique in business and the sciences when an outcome is binary. For example. clinical trials may employ a logistic regression model when an outcome is presence or absence of disease. or a business may use such a model when the outcome is the presence or absence of a customer’s purchase of a product. An ideal logistic regression model both discriminates well and is well-calibrated. A well-calibrated model is one where the predicted percentages of success are close to the observed percentages.,True,IokjV-sAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1,https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1469186992,1488666042359568367,/scholar?cites=1488666042359568367,,https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1469186992&disposition=inline,0,0,0

Attendance at the postpartum visit was compared for women with sterilization. contraception initiated prior to discharge (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or etonogestrel implant). hormonal contraception prescription. or no contraception provided at postpartum discharge. Poisson regression models with robust standard errors were used to estimate the relative risk of postpartum visit attendance controlling for age. race. and parity. insurance status. and histories of both depression and drug abuse.Of the 1015 women who met inclusion criteria. 55% had been prescribed contraception. had initiated contraception prior …,True,IokjV-sAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010782420303851,,,,,0,0,0

Primary outcomes were preterm birth and low birth weight. Propensity score methods were used to provide strong control for confounders.ResultsThe final analytic file comprised 675 exposed pregnancies and a propensity score-matched group of 1336 unexposed pregnancies. Most of the women were non-Hispanic Black.

Study Design This is a retrospective cohort study of 359.396 Ohio Medicaid mothers from 2008 to 2015. The last baby for each mother was included in the final dataset. Births prior to 22 weeks were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to create three models. These models were validated on a cohort that was set aside and not part of the model development. The main outcome measure was birth prior to 32 weeks. Results The final dataset contained 359.396 live births with 6.516 (1.81%) very preterm births. All models had excellent calibration. Goodness-of-fit tests suggested strong agreement between the probabilities estimated by the model and the actual …,True,IokjV-sAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0040-1714423,,,,,0,0,0
