In general. in industrial equipment. the heat transfer rate can be improved with optimization of equipment including the domain structure and using the different types of nanofluids. Still. there is a big challenge to analyze the heat transfer and fluid circulation in the domain.

Over the 20 years. different numerical methods have been implemented in the modeling of the heat and fluid distribution in industrial equipment containing nanofluids. Among all mathematical and numerical methods. Cubic-Interpolated Pseudo-Particle (CIP) model provides a strong potential in the prediction of the fluid structure and heat analysis. when there is a complex structure of thermal walls and high concentration of nanoparticles.

Blockage in lean oil stream resulted to plant operational problems. such as off spec result in export gas. feed gas reduction and high methanol injection. In this paper hydrate. wax. ice formation and TEG freezing are evaluated by QCM and GC as potential causes for this blockage. Test results appeared that the solids are not heavier hydrocarbons crystallizing. None of the chemical treatments aimed at removing/reducing problems associated with the crystallization of hydrocarbon solids were effective for the solids formed in the fluids tested in this work. It also indicated that the melting point of the solids. ice. as measured by the QCM is related to the solubility of the water in the sample. The effect of TEG must be very small. as the solid formation problem was almost eliminated after drying by calcium chloride. Finally. the preceding findings suggest that ice is the cause of the solids formation at low temperature and methanol injection at a rate of over 400 ppm by mass can prevent the formation of solids.,True,12OjvocAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,https://www.pet.hw.ac.uk/icgh7/papers/icgh2011Final00645.pdf,3715280879939376994,/scholar?cites=3715280879939376994,,https://www.pet.hw.ac.uk/icgh7/papers/icgh2011Final00645.pdf,0,0,0

To evaluate the performance of polymer gel in a condition near the actual well condition. experiments were conducted in a two-dimensional reservoir model. To form the gel in-situ. a Cr (III)-Acetate-HPAM gelant was used. The results showed that gelant can be injected into the core with permeability more than 60 mD. The flow resistance to water is 8 times as large as that to oil. The Water permeability was preferentially reduced in gel treatment with both water injection and simultaneous water and oil injection.

Ethyl Benzene and xylene) has been conducted. The Amine process absorbs heavy hydrocarbons and aromatics from gas stream in addition to the acid components. Whether the acid gas is to be vented or fed to a sulfur plant. it is highly desirable to remove these compounds from the acid gas. The amount of BTX components emitted from most gas processing facilities has become a significant environmental concern. The analysis showed that amine circulation rates and temperature have been a significant effect on limiting overall BTX emissions. Also. in our experimental and simulating data. we focused on acid gas enrichment. fuel gas spiking in reaction furnace and reactor temperature adjustment and indicated that reaction furnace temperature is the most effective parameter for BTX removal. Optimization in fuel gas flow rate and acid gas concentration was done and a new catalyst arrangement and some other operational measurements were suggested in this research. Recovery Efficiency increased from 85.49% to 95.47% and from commercial point of view. catalyst life time and sulphur efficiency (about 10%) increased considerably with no capital equipment cost.

Zeolites. carbon molecular sieves. graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are most commonly used fillers in the development of MMMs. Among these materials. CNTs have been proposed recently for gas separation application due to their attractive properties. Although CNTs have excellent separation properties. preparation of CNT‐MMMs is more complicated. To employ CNTs as effective reinforcement in the polymeric matrix. proper dispersion and suitable interfacial adhesion between the CNTs and the polymer matrix have to be guaranteed. In this paper. recent advances and developments on CNTs dispersion and alignment in the matrix were reviewed.

As the novelty. the evaluation of CO2 acid gas removal from gaseous mixture applying four novel absorbing agents (potassium threonate (PT). piperazine (PZ). pure water (H 2 O) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)) is implemented in the HFMC with the aim of introducing a more efficient liquid absorbent for CO 2 sequestration. Model validation is done based on the comparison of mathematical model outcomes and experimental data in a wide range of H2O velocity and confirms a desirable agreement with an average relative deviation (ARD) of approximately 3% for CO 2 flux. It is perceived from the results that PZ is introduced as the most efficient liquid absorbent for CO2 sequestration and MDEA. PT and H 2 O are in the next category (100% removal using PZ> 96% removal using MDEA> 89% removal using PT> 57% removal using H 2 O). The results corroborate that increase in membrane tortuosity and gas velocity negatively affects the sequestration process while increment of module length and porosity improve the separation of CO 2.,True,cmwF0p0AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,19,https://pp.bme.hu/ch/article/view/13172,9669647771864723856,/scholar?cites=9669647771864723856,,https://pp.bme.hu/ch/article/download/13172/8232,0,0,0

It is important in these applications to realize flow field and heat transfer in porous enclosures considering the effect of local buoyancy. Several articles have investigated the natural convection heat transfer from various shapes of annulus filled with porous media [1. 2. and 3].

The second formulation includes Alcell lignin and MCC 101 as the excipient and paracetamol. and the third formulation consists of carboxylated Alcell lignin. MCC 101 and paracetamol. Direct compaction was carried out in order to prepare the tablets. Lignin can be readily chemically modified due to the existence of different functional groups in its structure. The focus of this investigation is on lignin carboxylation and its influence on paracetamol control release behavior at varying pH. Results suggest that carboxylated lignin tablets had the highest drug release. which is linked to their faster disintegration and lower tablet hardness.

1188196,Composite membranes for gas separation,2018,Kazem Shahidi,,,,,,In this work. an efficient method with a limited amount of solvent use is presented to produce high-performance flat sheet composite membranes for gas separation. In particular. a series of polydimethylsiloxane/low-density polyethylene (PDMS/LDPE) membranes were produced by coating an active PDMS layer on a microporous LDPE support via continuous extrusion and salt leaching using immersion in hot water. The proposed method is simple and cost-effective since it is based on inexpensive materials (LDPE and PDMS) and uses a low amount of an environmentally friendly solvent (water). To improve the composite membranes performance and properties. trimethylsiloxy grafted fumed silica (TFS) particles were incorporated into the PDMS layer to produce PDMS-TFS/LDPE nano-composite membranes. The membranes were then characterized in terms of morphology. porosity and pore size distribution. as well as thermal. mechanical. sorption and permeation properties. Since the membrane properties depend on the processing conditions. the composite membranes production was optimized for a different number of coatings. nano-particles loading and coating concentration. Membrane performance (permeability and selectivity) was studied under different operating conditions (temperature and pressure). and the results showed that the PDMSTFS10%/ LDPE nano-composite membrane is highly suitable for different industrial applications of higher hydrocarbon separations.,True,4o22wrEAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/handle/20.500.11794/32485,,,,https://corpus.ulaval.ca/jspui/bitstream/20.500.11794/32485/1/34524.pdf,0,0,0

Experiments were conducted by Taguchi method as an experimental design. Then the same experiments were performed for zinc. lead and chromium ions. It was found that performance of an ED cell is almost independent on the type of ions and only depends on the operating conditions and the cell structure.

Lead removal from wastewater is an important problem in battery industries. The separation process by means of electrodialysis (ED) shows several advantages such as highly selective desalination. high water recovery. only a partial addition of chemicals and the possibility of a stop-and-go operation. The performance of an ED plant is determined by a set of fixed and variable process parameters such as stack construction. feed and product concentrations. membrane permselectivity. flow velocities. current density. recovery rates. etc. For an efficient operation of ED. the process has to be optimized in terms of overall costs considering component design and properties as well as all operating parameters.

However. their inability to resist high temperatures limits their use in certain industries. Some polymer membranes can be operated at some levels of the unpleasant environments. but the energy- and cost-efficiencies are offset by the necessity to severely cool hot streams. In many cases. such implementation is impossible or altogether impractical. Therefore. numerous studies have been focused on modifying polymers to create synthetic polymeric membranes which survive at high temperatures. Polymer scientists introduced many thermally stable polymers mostly based on carbocyclic and heterocyclic aromatic polymers. which exhibit enhanced thermal stability. However. the major problem with these polymers is their low processability. which is mainly due to their insolubility or high phase transition temperatures.

By increasing the feed temperature from 25 oC to 60 oC. the temperature polarization increases and the polarization coefficient (TPC) decreases; for instance. for membranes with PP. the TPC decreases from 0.95 to 0.905. By increasing the feed temperature. higher fluxes are achieved for both the gas velocities. Therefore. by increasing the feed temperature from 50 oC up to 80 oC. the distillate flux grows 9 times. Also. the distillate flux for membrane with PVDF as polymer increased from 0 to 4.2 by increasing the feed temperature from 40 oC to 70 oC. The model predictions show a small error of 3.6% with the experimental data reported in literature which indicates the reliability of simulated results.,True,t1dIc3MAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,5,http://www.jwent.net/article_29783_4958.html,1218402719018915995,/scholar?cites=1218402719018915995,,http://www.jwent.net/article_29783_4958.html,0,0,0

Ltd.,A novel pharmacological mechanism of action for the anxiolytic botanical Melissa officinalis L. (lemon balm) is reported. The methanol extract was identified as a potent in vitro inhibitor of rat brain GABA transaminase (GABA‐T). an enzyme target in the therapy of anxiety. epilepsy and related neurological disorders. Bioassay‐guided fractionation led to the identification and isolation of rosmarinic acid (RA) and the triterpenoids. ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) as active principles. Phytochemical characterization of the crude extract determined RA as the major compound responsible for activity (40% inhibition at 100 µg/mL) since it represented approximately 1.5% of the dry mass of the leaves. Synergistic effects may also play a role. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons.

1188278,Hop-by-hop dynamic addressing based (H2-DAB) routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks,2009,Muhammad Ayaz and Azween Abdullah,,,,436-441,IEEE,Providing an efficient communication for the underwater wireless sensor networks is a significant problem due to the unique characteristics of such environments. Radio signal cannot propagate well in deep water. and we have to replace this with the acoustic channel. This replacement results in many issues like high latency due to less propagation speeds. low bandwidths and high error probability. In addition. new features like node mobility with water currents and 3-dimensional space brings additional challenges to the underwater sensor network (UWSN) protocol design. Many routing protocols have been proposed for such environments but most of them considered that the complete dimensional location of all the sensor nodes is already known through a localization process. which itself is a challenging task in UWSNs.

1188284,SIT: a lightweight encryption algorithm for secure internet of things,2017,Muhammad Usman and Irfan Ahmed and M Imran Aslam and Shujaat Khan and Usman Ali Shah,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.08688,,,,The Internet of Things (IoT) being a promising technology of the future is expected to connect billions of devices. The increased number of communication is expected to generate mountains of data and the security of data can be a threat. The devices in the architecture are essentially smaller in size and low powered. Conventional encryption algorithms are generally computationally expensive due to their complexity and requires many rounds to encrypt. essentially wasting the constrained energy of the gadgets. Less complex algorithm. however. may compromise the desired integrity. In this paper we propose a lightweight encryption algorithm named as Secure IoT (SIT). It is a 64-bit block cipher and requires 64-bit key to encrypt the data. The architecture of the algorithm is a mixture of feistel and a uniform substitution-permutation network. Simulations result shows the algorithm provides substantial security in just five encryption rounds. The hardware implementation of the algorithm is done on a low cost 8-bit micro-controller and the results of code size. memory utilization and encryption/decryption execution cycles are compared with benchmark encryption algorithms.

Fossil fuel burning serves the main part of energy needs. The projections of world energy consumption by all the energy sources up to the mid-21stcentury introduce natural gas stays on ahead of the others. It involves with the simultaneous challenges of CO2 separation from natural/bio gas (acid gas removal) as well as subsequent capture of CO2 emitted from power plants (in order to mitigating the global warming accompanied by CO2 emission). Membrane gas separation has crucial advantages among all other CO2 separation technologies such as absorption. adsorption. and cryogenic distillation. One of the main purposes of research in membrane gas separation is fabrication of membranes with superior permeability and selectivity. Although polymeric membranes possess many advantages such as the ability for easy fabrication of large membrane areas at low cost. they suffer from problems associated with the trade-off relationship between permeability and selectivity. Therefore. they traditionally undergo an upper bound limitation.

Fossil fuel burning serves the main part of energy needs. The projections of world energy consumption by all the energy sources up to the mid-21stcentury introduce natural gas stays on ahead of the others. It involves with the simultaneous challenges of CO2 separation from natural/bio gas (acid gas removal) as well as subsequent capture of CO2 emitted from power plants (in order to mitigating the global warming accompanied by CO2 emission). Membrane gas separation has crucial advantages among all other CO2 separation technologies such as absorption. adsorption. and cryogenic distillation. One of the main purposes of research in membrane gas separation is fabrication of membranes with superior permeability and selectivity. Although polymeric membranes possess many advantages such as the ability for easy fabrication of large membrane areas at low cost. they suffer from problems associated with the trade-off relationship between permeability and selectivity. Therefore. they traditionally undergo an upper bound limitation.

Mullite and combined mullite-alumina (50% alumina content) tubular low-cost ceramic supports were fabricated. and their influence on membrane performance was compared to a commercial α-alumina support. The membrane preparation parameters were different ceramic supports and the concentration of chitosan solution (varying from 2 wt.% to 4 wt.%). The supports and hybrid membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and contact angle measurements. The results show. with increasing chitosan concentration. the permeability decreases. and selectivity increases. It was also found that the separation factor decreases with increasing feed temperature and feed water content. while the permeation flux increases. The membrane that was coated on α-alumina support with a 3 wt.% chitosan concentration exhibited the best pervaporation performance. leading to a permeation flux and separation factor of 352 g· m− 2· h− 1 and 200 for 90 wt.% ethanol in feed at 60 C. respectively.

The PAN fiber is first stretched and simultaneously oxidized in a temperature range of 200–300 °C. This treatment converts thermoplastic PAN to a non-plastic cyclic or a ladder compound. After oxidation. the fibers are carbonized at about 1000 °C in inert atmosphere which is usually nitrogen. Then. in order to improve the ordering and orientation of the crystallites in the direction of the fiber axis. the fiber must be heated at about 1500–3000 °C until the polymer contains 92–100%.

The nanocomposite substrates so prepared were then characterized with respect to hydrophilicity. overall porosity. surface roughness and cross-sectional morphology. It was found that both hydrophilicity and porosity of the substrate were increased upon addition of TiO2. In addition. long finger-like structures were developed by increasing the TiO2 loading. leading to water permeability enhancement. In order to fabricate thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes for forward osmosis (FO) application. a thin polyamide layer was formed by interfacial polymerization of 1.3-phenylendiamine and 1.3.5-benzenetricarbonyl trichloride on the top surface of PSf–TiO2 nanocomposite substrates.

The plasticization of the polymer matrix by penetrant gases can be attributed to the swelling stresses on the polymer network. It is well known that sorption of carbon dioxide in glassy polymers can facilitate the local segmental organization with a reduction in the permselectivity and substantially affect membrane morphological performance. Hence. plasticization is a phenomenon that most frequently encountered in polymer–gas systems for commercial CO2/CH4 separation applications where the membranes are exposed to high CO2 concentration in the feed stream. This paper attempts to present an overview of the plasticization phenomenon and the alteration of physical properties resulting from the polymer plasticization by the sorbed penetrant molecules.

There are a large number of investigations about this phenomenon. The neccessity of facing this problem has been considered in many cases. Some chemical methods and technologies have been used in order to inhibit the hydrate formation in pipelines or to predict it. In this study. a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling was employed to predict the probability of hydrate formation in the gas pipeline. The proposed model was validated using the operational data of Ilam refinery gas pipeline. The pipeline was simulated and the results were compared with the experimental data. The obtained numerical results showed enough agreement with the experimental data. Regarding pressure gradient in the pipeline. hydrate formation temperature was calculated and the possibility of hydrate formation in the pipeline was evaluated according to the comparison between the hydrate formation temperature and the actual temperature. In addition. various parameters such as inlet temperature. ambient temperature. and gas flow rate were studied in order to find the hydrate formation probability using the sensitivity analysis method. Results showed that the inlet and ambient temperatures are usually higher than the hydrate formation temperature. so the probability of hydrate formation is low in the pipeline. Moreover. the results clearly showed that increasing the gas flow rate or decreasing the gas inlet temperature can increase the probability of hydrate formation in the pipeline.,True,oDlt0lsAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,0,http://jogpt.pgu.ac.ir/article_105235.html,,,,http://jogpt.pgu.ac.ir/article_105235_b4f3fc2a2c8bc93d313257354f4024c0.pdf,0,0,0

L/S. are different from the theoretical cavity ratio. ie 3/1. The new model has been developed on this new concept when PVCap is present. It has been assumed that the number of small cavities to water molecules for methane hydrate in the presence of PVCap depends on PVCap concentration.

At a specified temperature. three phase LHV equilibrium curves of pore hydrates were shifted to the higher pressure region depending on pore sizes when compared with those of bulk hydrates. The activity of water in porous media was expressed with a correction term to account for capillary effect. Hydrate dissociation temperature in bulk water is calculated using van der Waals-Plaateuw (vdW-P) solid solution theory. After all. methane hydrate dissociation temperature in the porous media is calculated using a model first proposed by Pieroen for∆ H/nR. It was found out that in the porous media. operating pressure of hydrate phase boundary increases with decreasing pore radius. A general equation is suggested to estimate∆ H/nR for methane hydrate dissociation conditions in a porous media as a function of pore radius. Experimental data were achieved from the literature.

Also this analysis does not have ability to calculate a portion of exergy destruction which has been produced through performance of a component alone. In this study advanced exergetic analysis was performed for five mixed refrigerant LNG processes and four parts of irreversibility (avoidable/unavoidable) and (endogenous/exogenous) were calculated for the components with high inefficiencies. The results showed that portion of endogenous exergy destruction in the components is higher than the exogenous one. In fact interactions among the components do not affect the inefficiencies significantly. Also this analysis showed that structural optimization cannot be useful to decrease the overall process irreversibilities. In compressors high portion of the exergy destruction is related to the avoidable one. thus they have high …,True,OXAxazoAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,132,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890413007723,6333509859595791262,/scholar?cites=6333509859595791262,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38118888/1-s2.0-S0196890413007723-main.pdf,0,0,0

On the basis of the energy analysis. three‐stage process of Linde AG and Stat oil (mixed fluid cascade [MFC]) has less energy consumption than the other ones (0.254 kWh/kg liquefied natural gas). Also. coefficient of performance of the cycles of this process is higher compared with the other ones. Exergy analysis results showed that the maximum exergy efficiency is related to the MFC process (51.82%). However. performance of the MFC process in terms of quality and quantity of energy consumption is considerable. But using three cycles in this process needs more components and consequently more fixed costs.

However. due to the advantages and disadvantages of current invented configurations and changeable operating conditions of such processes and the different prices of the products and operating costs. selection of a configuration as the best one is not easy. In this work a new parameter for evaluating the degree of integration of such processes is introduced. This parameter can evaluate the degree of integration based on the recovered refrigeration from the process streams against the required refrigeration which is gained by different sources.

Different mass transfer resistance mechanisms of pore. solid and bidispersed diffusion. together with nonlinear isotherms (Longmuir. Frendlich. Sips and Toth) are taken into account in modeling the fixed bed adsorbers. The Extended Longmuir isotherm was found to explain properly the binary and ternary mixtures in adsorption/desorption process. Almost all the mass transfer approximations were explained by the linear driving force. LDF. although the alternative driving force. ADF. approximation was examined in some cases. The numerical solution was the Implicit Method of Lines which converted the partial differential equations to the ODEs then solving them by the Runge-Kutta method. Validation of the models was performed by the experimental data derived from the literature for different types of adsorbents and adsorbates. The sensitivity analyses was carried out to find out variation of the breakthrough curves against some physical and operational parameters such as; temperature. flow rate. initial and inlet concentration and particle adsorbent size.

After selecting the process configuration. the flow rate. pressure. and temperature of the process fluid streams are determining factors which should be tuned in order to find the optimum condition. Products specification and operating costs of the plant are two significant parameters which should be considered in an optimal design. Moreover. process design limitations contribute to the problem being more difficult.

When a constant heat flux is allowed to flow. we observe sharp jumps in temperature at the boundaries. characteristic of interfaces between materials of differing thermal properties. On the basis of the magnitude of these jumps. we have computed the boundary conductance of twin grain boundaries as a function of their misorientation angles.

We find that the reduced GO sheets are characterized by a large number of stable holelike defects formed by breaking of C−C bonds in the basal plane. These defects are always decorated by the carbonyl (CO) groups and are formed due to the strain in the basal plane created by epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups that are located close to each other. With very few exceptions. the carbonyl groups that are observed in Raman spectroscopy and other experimental studies are generally attributed to the CO terminations of the edges.

Achiev Mater. Manufact. Engng,,422-428,,Purpose: The subject of this paper is to study the thermoelastic behavior of thick functionally graded hollow sphere under thermal and mechanical loads. The mechanical and thermal properties of FG sphere are assumed to be functions of radial position.Design/methodology/approach: In present study. two methods are used to estimate the effective mechanical properties of FG sphere. One of the simplest methods in estimation of the effective mechanical and thermal properties of a mixture of two constituent materials is the Rule of Mixture (RM) scheme. Another scheme for estimating the mechanical properties is due to the work of Mori-Tanaka. When the mechanical properties of FG sphere are estimated by using the Mori-Tanaka scheme. thermal material properties of FG body may be determined utilizing the RM or the other methods which will be discussed as follows. Findings: Results for the temperature. radial displacement. radial stress and hoop stress fields through the geometry of the sphere are give. The figures reveal that some minor difference may be obtained for two schemes and the difference between the results for displacement distribution is larger than difference of temperature and stress distributions.Practical implications: The thermal material properties are obtained utilizing the Hatta-Taya and Rosen-Hashin relations.

The first is the development of a robust methodology for generating 3D statistically equivalent virtual polycrystalline microstructures (3D-SEVPM) of Ni-based superalloys. Starting from electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) images of sections. the method develops distributions and correlation functions of various morphological and crystallographic parameters. To incorporate twins in the parent grain microstructure. the joint probability of the number of twins and parent grain size. and the conditional probability distributions of twin thickness and twin distance are determined. Subsequently. a method is devised for inserting twins following the distribution functions.

Yet. despite over a century of research. the physical mechanisms of HE are too poorly understood to predict HE-induced failures with confidence. We use non-destructive. synchrotron-based techniques to investigate the relationship between the crystallographic character of grain boundaries and their susceptibility to hydrogen-assisted fracture in a nickel superalloy. Our data lead us to identify a class of grain boundaries with striking resistance to hydrogen-assisted crack propagation: boundaries with low-index planes (BLIPs). BLIPs are boundaries where at least one of the neighboring grains has a low Miller index facet—{001}.{011}. or {111}—along the grain boundary plane. These boundaries deflect propagating cracks. toughening the material and improving its HE resistance.

The present analysis yields the grain size distribution in alloy 725 as well as the grain boundary character distribution (GBCD) as a function of lattice misorientation and boundary plane normal orientation. We find that the GBCD of Ni-base alloy 725 is similar to that previously determined in pure Ni and other fcc-base metals. We find an elevated density of Σ9 and Σ3 grain boundaries.

We use a conceptual hydrologic model. developed and operated by the National Weather Service. to study the sensitivity of surface runoff in several sub-basins of the Colorado River to these changes. Increases in temperature of 2°C decrease mean annual runoff by 4–12%. A temperature increase of 4°C decreases mean annual runoff by 9–21%. Increases or decreases in annual precipitation of 10–20% result in corresponding changes in mean annual runoff of approximately 10–20%.

Ltd,Water use practices and conservation are the result of complex sociotechnical interactions of political. economic. hydroclimatic. and social factors. While the drivers of water demand have been extensively studied. they have traditionally been applied to models that assume stationary relationships between these various factors. and usually do not account for potential societal changes in response to increased scarcity awareness. For example. following a period of sustained low demand such as during a drought. communities often increase water use during a hydrologically wet period. a phenomenon known as “rebounding” water use. Previous experiences show the extent of this rebound is not a straightforward function of policy and efficiency improvements. but may also reflect short‐term or long‐lasting change in community behavior. which are not easily captured by models that assume stationarity.

1188528,Key Issues for Seawater Desalination in California: Cost and Financing,2014,Heather Cooley and Newsha Ajami,,,,93-121,Island Press/Center for Resource Economics,In June 2006. the Pacific Institute released Desalination. With a Grain of Salt. an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of seawater desalination for California. At that time. there were 21 active seawater desalination proposals along the California coast. Since then. only one project. a small plant in Sand City. has been permitted and built. A second project. in Carlsbad. has all of the necessary permits but has not yet secured financing. Interest in seawater desalination. however. remains high in California. and many agencies are conducting technical and environmental studies and pilot projects to determine whether to develop full-scale facilities.Beginning in 2011. the Pacific Institute initiated a new research project on seawater desalination. As part of that effort. we conducted some 25 one-on-one interviews with industry experts. water agencies. environmental and community groups. and regulatory agencies to identify some of the key outstanding issues for seawater desalination projects in California. We are now producing a series of research reports that evaluate these issues. The first report. released in July 2012. provided an update of the proposed projects along the California coast. In this report. the second in the series. we provide detailed information about the cost of seawater desalination projects. how they are financed. and some of the risks associated with these projects.

Today. it provides sufficient water to support over 315 million people. almost 55 million acres of irrigated farmland. and a $16 trillion economy. Yet the water sector faces increasing pressures. Growth in population and the economy. along with urbanization and land-use changes. are threatening both water quality and the ability to meet water demand. Looking to the future. climate change is expected to further stress water systems in large parts of the country. Water infrastructure. by some measures the oldest and most fragile part of the country’s built environment. has decayed.Solutions to the country’s growing water challenges lie. in part. with the development and adoption of new innovative technologies. Yet. in comparison to the electric power sector. investment in water innovation is extremely low. Indeed. investment by the savviest promoters of innovation—such as venture capital and corporate research and development—are strikingly low in the United States and globally when compared with other major sectors of the economy.

In a recent paper. Ajami et al.[2007] proposed the Integrated Bayesian Uncertainty Estimator (IBUNE) to quantify input. parameter and model uncertainties. This comment analyzes two interpretations of the IBUNE method and compares them to the Bayesian Total Error Analysis (BATEA) method [Kavetski et al.. 2002. 2006a]. It is shown that BATEA and IBUNE are based on the same hierarchical conceptualization of the input uncertainty. However. in interpretation A of IBUNE. the likelihood function. and hence the posterior distribution. are random functions of the inferred variables. which violates a standard requirement for probability density functions (pdf). A synthetic study shows that IBUNE-A inferences are inconsistent with the correct parameter values and model predictions. In the second interpretation. IBUNE-B. it is shown that a specific implementation of IBUNE is equivalent to a special Metropolis-Hastings sampler for the full Bayesian posterior. directly including the rainfall multipliers as latent variables (but not necessarily storing their samples). Consequently. IBUNE-B does not reduce the dimensionality of the sampling problem. Moreover. the jump distribution for the latent variables embedded in IBUNE-B is computationally inefficient and leads to prohibitively slow convergence. Modifications of these jump rules can cause convergence to incorrect posterior distributions. The primary conclusion of this comment is that. unless the hydrological model and the structure of data …,True,WmVPdq8AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,21,https://nova.newcastle.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/uon:6842/ATTACHMENT01,18430616333537093115,/scholar?cites=18430616333537093115,,https://nova.newcastle.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/uon:6842/ATTACHMENT01,0,0,0

This article draws on a literature review and interviews with permitting practitioners to identify factors that contribute to delayed permit decisions. The sociopolitical context. projects that are complex or use novel technology. a fragmented and bureaucratic regulatory regime. serial permit applications and reviews. and applicant and permitting agency knowledge and resources each contribute to permitting inefficiency when they foster uncertainty. increase transaction costs. and allow divergent interests to multiply. yet remain unresolved.

Introducing alternative water supplies such as recycled water. captured runoff. desalination. as well as demand management strategies such as conservation and efficiency measures. has been widely proposed to address the long-term sustainability of urban water resources. Collaborative efforts have the potential to achieve this goal through more efficient use of common pool resources and access to funding opportunities for supply diversification projects. However. this requires a paradigm shift towards holistic solutions that address the complexity of hydrologic. socio-economic and governance dynamics surrounding water management issues. The objective of this work is to develop a regional integrative framework for the assessment of water resource sustainability under current management practices. as well as to identify opportunities for sustainability improvement in coupled socio-hydrologic systems. We define the sustainability of a water utility as the ability to access reliable supplies to consistently satisfy current needs. make responsible use of supplies. and have the capacity to adapt to future scenarios. To compute a quantitative measure of sustainability. we develop a numerical index comprised of supply. demand. and adaptive capacity indicators. including an innovative way to account for the importance of having diverse supply sources.

An important source of atmospheric methane is the methane generated in organic‐rich sediments underlying surface water bodies. including lakes. wetlands. and the ocean. The fraction of the methane that reaches the atmosphere depends critically on the mode and spatiotemporal characteristics of free‐gas venting from the underlying sediments.

The MIT Microelectronics WebLab (or simply WebLab) is an online semiconductor characterization laboratory. While WebLab is primarily of interest in microelectronics education. it also represents a testbed for new pedagogical and technological concepts associated with online laboratories. Our latest release. WebLab 6.0. is constructed around the newly developed iLab Shared Architecture. This is a new three-tier framework designed to expedite the development and simplify the management of online laboratories. The iLab Shared Architecture introduces a piece of middleware (termed the “Service Broker”) between the Client application and Lab Server. The Service Broker uses Web Services to provide a generic set of functionality which is common to all labs. At the same time. it serves as a pass through between the Client and Lab Server for labspecific information such as experiment specifications and data. WebLab 6.0 is the first lab to be deployed within this new architecture. The new WebLab 6.0 Client incorporates Java support for digitally signed applets. This allows it to break out of the Java security “sandbox” and interact more directly with the student’s computer. In addition. the use of the open source package kSOAP enables the Client to communicate via Web Services. The WebLab 6.0 Lab Server has been rebuilt as a data-driven web application that communicates with the Service Broker via Web Services.

The purpose of this research is to develop a method to identify these events. and to provide users with an architecture that will allow them to analyze events online and in real-time. to act upon them. and to archive them for future offline analysis. This thesis is divided into two major portions. The first discusses a general software architecture that performs the functions defined above. The architecture proposed assumes no prior knowledge of the data. and is capable of dealing with multi-source data feed from any type of sensor(s) on one end. and can handle multiple clients on the other. The second part of the thesis discusses a wavelet-based algorithm for detecting certain types of events in real-time in one-dimensional numeric time-series data. Wavelets were judged to be the most appropriate technique for analyzing random sensor signals for which no prior information is available. The wavelet-based method in addition allows users to delve into different levels of abstraction (based on varying time periods) while looking at the data. which cannot be done by any previous method for real-time event detection.

1188559,Magnitude and spatio-temporal variability of methane emissions from a eutrophic freshwater lake,2009,Charuleka Varadharajan,,,,,,Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. and it can significantly impact global climate change. Considerable amounts of methane can be released to the atmosphere from freshwater lakes. particularly through bubbling. However. spatial and temporal heterogeneity in ebullition has complicated efforts to accurately measure such methane emissions. This thesis presents the results from a two-year study of methane biogeochemistry conducted at the eutrophic. stratified. Upper Mystic Lake located in eastern Massachusetts. US. Field sampling was done between June and November 2007. and between April and November 2008. In both years. ebullition at the lake was strongly episodic. and the amount and composition of bubbled gas varied considerably between sites. In 2008. under-water bubble traps were equipped with pressure sensors that measured the gas collected every 5 minutes for 4-6 months. The high-temporal resolution data showed that synchronized lake-wide bubbling episodes were triggered when hydrostatic pressures fell below a site-dependent threshold. Twice as much bubbling was observed in 2007 than in 2008. In both years. approximately 70% of the total methane export from the lake occurred through ebullition. and 30% through diffusion across the air-water interface at the lake surface. About 6-11 kg CH4/d was emitted to the atmosphere from the Upper Mystic Lake during the sampling periods of 2007 and 2008.,True,z0uhlmcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,12,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54879,6683686318712544542,/scholar?cites=6683686318712544542,,,0,0,0

SB 4 also requires the California Natural Resources Agency to conduct an independent scientific study of well stimulation technologies in California. SB 4 stipulates that the independent study assess current and potential future well stimulation practices. including the likelihood that these technologies could enable extensive new petroleum production in the state; evaluate the impacts of well stimulation technologies and the gaps in data that preclude this understanding; identify potential risks associated with current practices; and identify alternative practices that might limit these risks.(See Box 1.1-1 for a short history of oil and gas production in California.)

The reliability of reactive transport models predicting the response of groundwater to CO2 leakage depends on a thorough understanding of the relevant chemical processes and key parameters affecting dissolved CO2 transport and reaction. Such understanding can be provided by targeted field tests integrated with reactive transport modeling. A controlled-release field experiment was conducted in Mississippi to study the CO2-induced geochemical changes in a shallow sandy aquifer at about 50 m depth. The field test involved a dipole system in which the groundwater was pumped from one well. saturated with CO2 at the pressure corresponding to the hydraulic pressure of the aquifer. and then re-injected into the same aquifer using a second well.

Estrogenic EDCs (e-EDCs) are a subclass of EDCs that. when organisms are exposed to them. function as estrogens. Given that there are numerous e-EDCs that can negatively affect humans and wildlife. general screening techniques like biologically based assays (BBAs) may provide major advantages by estimating the total estrogenic effects of many e-EDCs in the environment. These techniques may potentially be adapted for field portable biologically directed sampling and analyses.

CP was synthesized during growth on a variety of carbon substrates and its production was not affected by the nature of the carbon source. High levels of yeast extract inhibited CP formation. CP was synthesized in batch culture at the same rate during exponential growth as in the post-exponential phase. Post-exponential CP production contributed at least half the final amount of CP measured. This phenomenon was observed in different culture media. although the specific yield of polysaccharide varied from one medium to another.

Our analysis addresses:(1) the characteristics of water use for well stimulation;(2) the volumes. chemical compositions. and potential hazards of stimulation fluids;(3) the characteristics of wastewater production and management;(4) the potential release mechanisms and transport pathways by which well stimulation chemicals enter the water environment; and (5) practices to mitigate or avoid impacts to water.Available records indicate that well stimulation in California uses an estimated 850.000 to 1.2 million m3 (690 to 980 acre-feet) of water per year. the majority of which (91%) is freshwater. Hydraulic fracturing has allowed oil and gas production from some new pools where it was not otherwise feasible or economical. We estimate that freshwater use for enhanced oil recovery in fields where production is enabled by stimulation was 2 million to 14 million m³ (1.600 to 13.000 acre-feet) in 2013.(Well stimulation includes hydraulic fracturing. matrix acidizing. and acid fracturing; enhanced oil recovery includes water flooding. steam flooding. and cyclic steaming. described briefly in Section 2.3 below.) Local impacts of water usage appear thus far to be minimal. with well stimulation accounting for less than 0.2% percent of total annual freshwater use within each of the state’s Water Resources Planning Areas. which range in size from 830 to 19.400 km2 (320 to 7.500 mi2). However. well stimulation is concentrated in water-scarce areas of the state. and an increase in water use or drawdown of local aquifers could cause competition with agricultural …,True,4-s3ghwAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,6,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6mp4080p/qt6mp4080p.pdf#page=83,11506884669930616260,/scholar?cites=11506884669930616260,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt6mp4080p/qt6mp4080p.pdf#page=83,0,0,0
1188603,Hazard assessment of chemical additives used in oil fields that reuse produced water for agricultural irrigation. livestock watering. and groundwater recharge in the San …,2016,Seth BC Shonkoff and WT Stringfellow and JK Doman,,,,,Technical report. PSE Healthy Energy. Oakland. CA. USA,Oil field produced water has been used to irrigate food crops in the Cawelo Water District since the mid-1990s. The practice has recently been expanded to the North Kern Water Storage District and produced water is being examined widely as a potential source of water for agriculture. livestock watering. drinking water and other uses. One important knowledge gap with respect to assessing potential human health and environmental hazards associated with reuse of oil field produced water for irrigation is an understanding of the types and amounts of chemical additives used during oil and gas development.Disclosure of chemical use during oil and gas development is considered an important component for understanding the potential risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation activities and disclosure is an important component of creating effective regulation of hazardous chemicals. For instance. regulations developed under California Senate Bill 4 require the reporting and public disclosure of chemical additives used for hydraulic fracturing and other well stimulation activities common to oil and gas development. These disclosure requirements. however. do not apply to other common or routine oil and gas field activities such as drilling. well maintenance. routine acidizing. and well completions (State of California 2013). Hazardous chemicals are used throughout the entire oil and gas development process. not just during well stimulations (Economides et al. 2013; Fink 2015; Hudgins 1992; Hudgins 1994; Kelland 2014).

Specially. we have targeted agricultural waste products that are prevalent in California such as grape pomace from the wine industry and egg waste from packing plants. Characterization of these waste products has included performing a host of laboratory tests to determine the salt and nutrient content of each waste. Additionally. we have conducted laboratory batch tests to determine both the ultimate bio-methane production of various agricultural waste products and the rates of bio-methane generation. We have also conducted economic and environmental assessments for a full-scale biomass energy system.MethodLaboratory experiments were conducted in accordance with Standard Methods. Bio-methane potential tests were conducted in temperature-controlled incubators. Samples were prepared anaerobically in a glove box. During the multi-day tests. pressure was measured and recorded automatically. Methane content was measured periodically using gas chromatography. A three liter flow-through anaerobic reactor was maintained and used to inoculate the batch test bottles. Full-scale assessments were performed at a biomass energy project that has 1.9 million liters of anaerobic digester capacity and a 710 kW generator.ResultsBatch test results indicate that the grape pomace and egg waste have ultimate methane potentials of 99.0 L CH4 kg-1 VS and. 484.1 L CH4 kg-1 VS respectively.

1188617,The “Melting” Spoon,2010,Jeremy Domen and Nick Merrier and Franklin Corpuz,,,,,,People with Parkinson’s disease experience difficulties eating. Occasionally. they will suddenly stop eating and are unable to start again (freezing and akinesia). until they are gently reminded to start eating again. by using some sort of signal or stimulus. Freezing cannot be predicted. so a tool is needed to help combat freezing when eating. We have observed a patient at ARC San Joaquin who freezes up often and continually over the course of a meal and must be told every few seconds by a caretaker to continue to eat. Through our study of the patient. our proposed solution is an attachment for the handle of any standard fork or spoon that will detect a lack of motion and set off a stimulus. in this case a vibration. The vibration is to let the user know that they must start eating again. This removable attachment will contain an electric motor. accelerometer. on/off switch. micro controller and a battery. The microcontroller will monitor the output from the accelerometer and create the appropriate outputs to the electric motor. The current model shows to be very promising. Preliminary results show that the accelerometer is able to detect a lack of motion occurring for more than two seconds. Upon this detection. the microcontroller will run the vibrator in intervals of 5 seconds. The vibration will stop once motion is detected again. This model is not aesthetically ready for the public. but work is being done to get everything into a presentable product.,True,4-s3ghwAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,0,https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/purcc/2010/events/74/,,,,,0,0,0

Similar evaluations for chemicals used in other routine oil and gas development activities. such as maintenance acidizing. gravel packing. and well drilling. have not been previously conducted. in part due to a lack of reliable information concerning on-field chemical-use. In this study. we compare chemical-use between routine activities and the more closely regulated well-stimulation activities using data collected by the South Coast Air Quality Monitoring District (SCAQMD). which mandates the reporting of both unconventional and routine on-field chemical-use for parts of Southern California. Analysis of this data shows that there is significant overlap in chemical-use between so-called unconventional activities and routine activities conducted for well maintenance. well-completion. or rework.

Our analysis addresses:(1) the characteristics of water use for well stimulation;(2) the volumes. chemical compositions. and potential hazards of stimulation fluids;(3) the characteristics of wastewater production and management;(4) the potential release mechanisms and transport pathways by which well stimulation chemicals enter the water environment; and (5) practices to mitigate or avoid impacts to water.Available records indicate that well stimulation in California uses an estimated 850.000 to 1.2 million m3 (690 to 980 acre-feet) of water per year. the majority of which (91%) is freshwater. Hydraulic fracturing has allowed oil and gas production from some new pools where it was not otherwise feasible or economical. We estimate that freshwater use for enhanced oil recovery in fields where production is enabled by stimulation was 2 million to 14 million m³ (1.600 to 13.000 acre-feet) in 2013.(Well stimulation includes hydraulic fracturing. matrix acidizing. and acid fracturing; enhanced oil recovery includes water flooding. steam flooding. and cyclic steaming. described briefly in Section 2.3 below.) Local impacts of water usage appear thus far to be minimal. with well stimulation accounting for less than 0.2% percent of total annual freshwater use within each of the state’s Water Resources Planning Areas. which range in size from 830 to 19.400 km2 (320 to 7.500 mi2).

Addition of oxidizing chemicals is often practiced as a mitigation strategy. One alternative is to remove odorous compounds in the gases vented from manholes using adsorptive media. In this study. odour control devices located at manholes were observed to determine the ability of these systems to reduce hydrogen sulphide from vented gases. The odour control devices incorporated pressure regulation to control gas flow out of manhole covers and adsorptive media to remove hydrogen sulphide in the vented gases prior to release. Pressure regulation was accomplished using a variable volume bladder and two pressure relief valves that permitted gas flow when pressures exceeded 1.3 to 2.5 cm water column.

1188639,Revising Roles: Enhancing an Engineering Capstone Course to Improve Outcomes for Women,2020,Eileen Camfield and MaryKay Camarillo,,,,,,Women leave the engineering profession at a high rate. This attrition is observed both in the university setting and in the workforce. Female students cite negative experiences with peers as a contributor to their dissatisfaction with engineering. Many of these negative experiences occur in team projects that are ubiquitous in engineering programs. In the absence of intentional instruction on teamwork and effective collaboration methods. students—especially women— struggle and have negative experiences that stymie the self-efficacy and confidence-building that should occur during the senior year. The objective of this paper is to highlight key issues with engineering capstone projects and to identify best practices that can result in better outcomes for women. Four recommendations evolved from this effort: 1.) Education on team function and bias in team dynamics is helpful. 2.) Teamwork skills and strategies for collaboration and conflict resolution need to be taught. 3.) Mentoring and engaging with students is an important aspect of the process and can be enhanced to better serve women. 4.)

As part of this air monitoring study. measurements were also made at reference locations. including background locations on the oil field but away from WST activities and off-field (ambient) locations away from oil fields. Air quality analytes measured in this study include toxic air pollutants. greenhouse gasses. atmospheric gasses. and volatile organic compounds. Volatile hydrocarbons associated with crude oil and natural gas production and compounds associated with vehicle activity and refrigeration were found at the same concentration during hydraulic fracturing activity as were measured on the oil field in the absence of WST. The off-field reference locations had similar air quality as the on-field locations and a geospatial analysis suggests some off-field reference locations may be too close to oil fields. It was recommended that specific locations known to represent ambient air quality be selected for off-field monitoring locations.

Surveying has historically been part of civil engineering and has included aerial photogrammetry. The advent of UAV technology offers a more convenient and less expensive method for using aerial photogrammetry. Civil engineers can use UAVs to advance mapping techniques and to collect and analyze geo-referenced data more efficiently. In addition to introducing relevant technology into coursework. we believe this project will provide meaningful educational experiences that literally get students out of the classroom and into “real world” applications. This type of project also cultivates technical proficiency in students.MethodAs part of the project we researched aerial photogrammetry concepts and terminology. found examples of interesting and useful applications. and reviewed available UAV technology and software. In particular. a review of third party software packages was conducted.

Two numerical modeling approaches for analyzing fault-slip are applied. one using continuum stress–strain analysis and the other using discrete fault analysis. The results of these two approaches to numerical fault-slip analyses are compared to the results of a more conventional analytical fault-slip analysis that assumes simplified reservoir geometry. It is shown that the simplified analytical fault-slip analysis may lead to either overestimation or underestimation of the maximum sustainable injection pressure because it cannot resolve important geometrical factors associated with the injection-induced spatial evolution of fluid pressure and stress.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) injection into and storage in such “closed” systems with impervious seals. or “semi-closed” systems with non-ideal (low permeability) seals. is different from that in “open” systems. from which the displaced brine can easily escape laterally. In closed or semi-closed systems. the pressure buildup caused by continuous industrial-scale CO2 injection may have a limiting effect on CO2 storage capacity. because geomechanical damage caused by overpressure needs to be avoided.

Different saturation scenarios were applied varying from fully saturated to highly unsaturated conditions. corresponding to different infiltration rates into the soil. It was found that the solute travels along preferred flow paths. which may be called channels. The degree of channeling. the location of channels. and the hydraulic properties along channels are a function of the mean saturation in the flow domain.

Ltd.,The scale and magnitude of pressure perturbation and brine migration induced by geologic carbon sequestration is discussed assuming a full‐scale deployment scenario in which enough CO2 is captured and stored to make relevant contributions to global climate change mitigation. In this scenario. the volumetric rates and cumulative volumes of CO2 injection would be comparable to or higher than those related to existing deep‐subsurface injection and extraction activities. such as oil production. Large‐scale pressure build‐up in response to the injection may limit the dynamic storage capacity of suitable formations. because over‐pressurization may fracture the caprock. may drive CO2/brine leakage through localized pathways. and may cause induced seismicity.

Local high‐conductivity features. such as improperly abandoned wells or conductive faults. could act as conduits for focused leakage of brine into shallow groundwater resources. Pressurized brine can also be pushed into overlying/underlying formations because of diffuse leakage through low‐permeability aquitards. which occur over large areas and may allow for effective pressure bleed‐off in the storage reservoirs. This study presents the application of a recently developed analytical solution for pressure buildup and leakage rates in a multilayered aquifer‐aquitard system with focused and diffuse brine leakage.

The basic idea is based on the fact that leakage-induced pressure signals travel much faster than the migrating CO2; thus such anomalies may be detected early enough for risk management measures taking effect in avoiding substantial CO2 leaks. The early detection methodology involves automatic inversion of anomalous brine leakage signals with efficient forward pressure and surface-deformation modeling tools to estimate the location and permeability of leaky features in the caprock. We conduct a global sensitivity analysis to better understand under which conditions pressure anomalies can be clearly identified as leakage signals. and evaluate signal detectability for a broad parameter range considering different detection limits and …,True,WrZRIWsAAAAJ:iH-uZ7U-co4C,73,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170813001097,9780349927740271247,/scholar?cites=9780349927740271247,,,0,0,0

Yet responsible decision-making about water resources management raises a fundamental challenge for hydrologists: making predictions about water resources on decadal- to century-long timescales. Obtaining insight into hydrologic futures over 100 yr timescales forces researchers to address internal and exogenous changes in the properties of hydrologic systems. To do this. new hydrologic research must identify. describe and model feedbacks between water and other changing. coupled environmental subsystems. These models must be constrained to yield useful insights. despite the many likely sources of uncertainty in their predictions. Chief among these uncertainties are the impacts of the increasing role of human intervention in the global water cycle – a defining challenge for hydrology in the Anthropocene. Here we present a research agenda that proposes a suite of strategies to address these challenges from the perspectives of hydrologic science research. The research agenda focuses on the development of co-evolutionary hydrologic modeling to explore coupling across systems. and to address the implications of this coupling on the long-time behavior of the coupled systems.

Inflows into TG Halli reservoir have declined sharply since the 1970s. The causes of the drying are poorly understood. resulting in misdirected or counter-productive management responses. Five plausible hypotheses that could explain the decline were tested using data from field surveys and secondary sources:(1) changes in rainfall amount. seasonality and intensity;(2) increases in temperature;(3) groundwater extraction;(4) expansion of eucalyptus plantations; and (5) fragmentation of the river channel. Our results suggest that groundwater pumping. expansion of eucalyptus plantations and. to a lesser extent. channel fragmentation are much more likely to have caused the decline in surface flows in the TG Halli catchment than changing climate.

In order to do this. we develop a hydrologic‐engineering‐economic model to address the complexity of urban water supply arising from consumers' dependence on multiple interconnected sources of water.

India,2008,Veena Srinivasan,69,,10,,,This dissertation addresses the challenge of supplying water to rapidly growing cities in South Asia. using evidence from the water-scarce city of Chennai. Chennai (formerly Madras) is a rapidly growing metropolis of over 6.5 million people. whose infrastructure has not kept pace with its growing demand for water. In the year 2003-2004. Chennai experienced a severe water crisis: the piped supply for the entire city was virtually shut down for a 12-month period. Consumers became dependent on private tanker suppliers trucking in untreated groundwater from peri-urban areas.This research effort accomplished three goals: understanding the dynamics of the recent water crisis. extending the model to project the business-as-usual trajectory of Chennai’s water supply and understanding how the trajectory may be altered by various policies. The study departs from previous research studies in several respects: Firstly. this study explicitly incorporates self-supply via private wells. and private-supply via the tanker market as an integral part of the urban water system. Secondly. the research integrates bio-physical and socio-economic behavior at multiple scales: user-scale supply and demand. utility-scale management. and basin-scale water availability and allocation.

Our study aimed to relate properties of the mineral matrix to its ability to protect organic C against decomposition in acid soils. We used the amount of hydroxyl ions released after exposure to NaF solution to establish a reactivity gradient spanning 12 subsoil horizons collected from 10 different locations. The subsoil horizons represent six soil orders and diverse geological parent materials. Phyllosilicates were characterized by X‐ray diffraction and pedogenic oxides by selective dissolution procedures. The organic carbon (C) remaining after chemical removal of an oxidizable fraction of SOM with NaOCl solution was taken to represent a stable organic carbon pool.

Recent studies are contradictory as to whether soil erosion does or does not constitute a C sink. Here we clarify the conceptual basis for how erosion can constitute a C sink. Specifically. the criterion for an erosional C sink is that dynamic replacement of eroded C. and reduced decomposition rates in depositional sites. must together more than compensate for erosional losses. This criterion is in fact met in many erosional settings. and thus erosion and deposition can make a net positive contribution to C sequestration. We show that. in a cultivated Mississippi watershed and a coastal California watershed. the magnitude of the erosion-induced C sink is likely to be on the order of 1% of NPP and 16% of eroded C.

Recent studies have shown that BC can be degraded in soils. We use two soils with very low spatial variability sampled 100 years apart in a Russian steppe preserve to generate the first whole-profile estimate of BC stocks and turnover in the field. Quantities of fire residues in soil changed significantly over a century. Black carbon stock was 2.5 kg m−2. or about 7–10% of total organic C in 1900. With cessation of biomass burning. BC stocks decreased 25% over a century. which translates into a centennial soil BC turnover (293 years best estimate; range 182–541 years). much faster than so-called inert or passive carbon in ecosystem models. The turnover time presented here is for loss by all processes. namely decomposition. leaching. and erosion. although the latter two were probably insignificant in this case. Notably. at both time points. the peak BC stock was below 30 cm. a depth interval. which is not typically accounted for. Also. the quality of the fire residues changed with time. as indicated by the use benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCA) as molecular markers. The proportions of less-condensed (and thus more easily degradable) BC structures decreased. whereas the highly condensed (and more recalcitrant) BC structures survived unchanged over the 100-year period.

We derive optimized fluxes from June 2009 to December 2010. We estimate fluxes from surface CO2 measurements to use as baselines for comparing GOSAT data-derived fluxes. Assimilating only GOSAT data. we can reproduce the observed CO2 time series at surface and TCCON sites in the tropics and the northern extra-tropics. In contrast. in the southern extra-tropics GOSAT XCO2 leads to enhanced seasonal cycle amplitudes compared to independent measurements. and we identify it as the result of a land–sea bias in our GOSAT XCO2 retrievals. A bias correction in the form of a global offset between GOSAT land and sea pixels in a joint inversion of satellite and surface measurements of CO2 yields plausible global flux estimates which are more tightly constrained than in an inversion using surface CO2 data alone. We show that assimilating the bias-corrected GOSAT data on top of surface CO2 data (a) reduces the estimated global land sink of CO2. and (b) shifts the terrestrial net uptake of carbon from the tropics to the extra-tropics. It is concluded that while GOSAT total column CO2 provide useful constraints for source–sink inversions. small spatiotemporal biases – beyond what can be detected using current validation techniques – have serious consequences for optimized fluxes. even aggregated over continental scales.,True,YdAPYl2NLo4C:qe6vwMD2xtsC,188,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/8695/2013/,4772881531533563035,/scholar?cites=4772881531533563035,,https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/13/8695/2013/acp-13-8695-2013.pdf,0,0,0

This relevance. due to a shorter atmospheric lifetime and a stronger warming potential than carbon dioxide. is challenged by the still unexplained changes of atmospheric CH 4 over the past decade. Emissions and concentrations of CH 4 are continuing to increase. making CH 4 the second most important human-induced greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Two major difficulties in reducing uncertainties come from the large variety of diffusive CH 4 sources that overlap geographically. and from the destruction of CH 4 by the very short-lived hydroxyl radical (OH). To address these difficulties. we have established a consortium of multi-disciplinary scientists under the umbrella of the Global Carbon Project to synthesize and stimulate research on the methane cycle. and producing regular (∼ biennial) updates of the global methane budget.

With future warming. these soils may release carbon to the atmosphere and act as a positive feedback to climate change. Significant uncertainty remains on the postthaw carbon dynamics of permafrost-affected ecosystems. in particular since most of the carbon resides at depth where decomposition dynamics may differ from surface soils. and since nitrogen mineralized by decomposition may enhance plant growth. Here we show. using a carbon−nitrogen model that includes permafrost processes forced in an unmitigated warming scenario. that the future carbon balance of the permafrost region is highly sensitive to the decomposability of deeper carbon. with the net balance ranging from 21 Pg C to 164 Pg C losses by 2300.

Farmers need access to phosphate fertilizers to achieve the high crop yields needed to feed the world. Yet growing global demand for phosphorus could surpass supply in the coming decades. and the world currently largely relies on non-renewable phosphate rock that is mined in only a few countries. Morocco alone controls 75% of the remaining reserves. including those in the conflict territory of Western Sahara. While some argue that the market will take care of any scarcity. the market price of phosphate fertilizers fails to account for far-ranging negative impacts. Drawing on multi-stakeholder supply chain risk frameworks. the article identifies a range of negative impacts. including the exploitation and displacement of the Saharawi people. the destruction of aquatic ecosystems by nutrient pollution. and jeopardizing future generations' ability to produce food.

UTS and Cardno (Brisbane),This independent review aims to assess the Queensland Government's proposed strategy for meeting the long-term water supply-demand balance for South East Queensland. of which the Traveston Crossing scheme is a major and controversial component. The review. conducted by a team from the ISF at the UTS and Cardno. concludes that a diverse portfolio of options can ensure supply security for South East Queensland (SEQ) well into the future. certainly to 2050. Such options include: increasing water supply availability (supply-side options); decreasing the demand for water (demand-side options); and meeting water supply needs during deep droughts (drought response options). A number of the elements of such a portfolio are already being implemented as part of the current Queensland Government strategy. With the extension and addition of low unit cost demand-side options and supply-side drought response readiness options. a clear conclusion of this study is that the proposed dam at Traveston Crossing on the Mary River is neither necessary nor desirable as a part of the portfolio for ensuring supply security to 2050. The increase in supply from this proposed dam will not assist in the short-term during the current severe drought in which water (from savings and supply) is needed over the next two to three years. Planned completion of the Traveston Crossing Dam Stage 1 is in 2012. Additional time will be needed for the dam to fill. which could take an additional two years. resulting in the yield from this source only potentially being available in 2014.

The conventional roles of water and wastewater utilities are being redefined with the objectives of resource conservation and sustainable development added to existing responsibilities.Least cost planning (LCP) has emerged as the way forward for water utilities in regions where water conservation has become an objective or where ongoing supply expansion is constrained. It involves techniques for the design and evaluation of demand management programs and aims to compare demand-and supply-side options on an equivalent basis. The approach is based on the key ideas that: demand is for the services water provides rather than the actual volume supplied; and that a drop of water saved is equal to a drop supplied. This paper contends that LCP has much to offer the water sector beyond demand management. It is an approach that has potential for options assessment across the water cycle and can aid planning towards more sustainable outcomes within the sector. The paper concludes that LCP concepts and techniques will have worth in addressing the challenges of sustainable development for both urban water systems and catchment management.,True,6cYMDR0AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,14,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ajA4ZN-KIvYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA35&dq=info:6kduXqGf67MJ:scholar.google.com&ots=xw8n5oI9vN&sig=Z3kZqk731qcNhRKY88JZ8baUwUw,12964631467738941418,/scholar?cites=12964631467738941418,,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/11703/1/2009003113.pdf,0,0,0

This paper identifies those plants and focuses on the context surrounding the decision to build the plant in Sydney. Whilst a portfolio approach allowed lower cost options for secure supply to be identified–including an innovative ‘desalination-readiness option’–perceived uncertainty and political decisions led the state government to build the desalination plant before the carefully considered planning triggers dictated and without revisiting the decision when the drought broke. Media analysis is used to construct a timeline of reported headlines relating to the pre-and post-construction periods including events surrounding heavy rain. overflowing dams and dialogue on desalination being unnecessary and expensive. The paper highlights a disconnect between the planning processes. stakeholder and community engagement and political decision-making.

Of these. water conservation is both the most cost-effective and the most resource-use-effective ie it saves materials and energy required for treatment. distribution. use and collection. Great examples of water conservation abound across the spectrum of water users. New water users in residential. industrial. institutional and commercial scenarios likely present better water saving investment opportunities. but retrofits are essential to reduce current water use.

Cities and farms. despite feeling the effects of curtailed water supplies. have by and large demonstrated great resilience (Hanak et al. 2015; Cooley et al. 2015). but small water suppliers and natural systems have not fared as well. Some public water systems struggled to deliver safe water to their customers. thousands of household wells ran dry. and endangered fish reached the brink of extinction (Moyle 2014; Braxton Little 2016; State of California 2016).

1188808,A case study of the potential risks associated with hydraulic fracturing in existing oil fields in the san Joaquin basin,2015,Preston Jordan and Adam Brandt and Kyle Ferrar and Laura Feinstein and Scott Phillips,,An independent scientific assessment of well stimulation in California,,267,,This case study discusses the conceivable future of hydraulic fracturing in the San Joaquin Basin and the potential consequent impacts on water and air resources. public health. and wildlife and vegetation. The rate of well stimulation in the San Joaquin Basin will likely continue over the next decade as it has over the last decade. Assessments have estimated large reserves in existing fields that have been the most productive historically. and the trends in past and current production patterns are quite likely to continue. In contrast. development of oil or gas production from source rock appears relatively unlikely. Additional production in predominantly hydraulically fractured pools can be delivered by installing new wells in existing fields. and there is sufficient remaining resource in those pools for production to continue in this manner for at least another decade.Future oil production will continue to produce water. There are potential opportunities to reduce the amount of high-quality and low-salinity water consumed by production. and opportunities for beneficial reuse of the water produced along with the oil. One of the current methods for produced water disposal from pools with hydraulic fracturing in the San Joaquin Basin is discharge into evaporation-percolation pits. This presents a potential risk for contamination of potable groundwater resources and should be phased out in the future. Some produced water from pools with hydraulic fracturing has also been disposed of by injection into subsurface reservoirs with ground water resources that perhaps should not have been exempted from protection.

Historically. most California production has been migrated oil in conventional traps. rather than oil produced directly from source rocks. Here we evaluate Monterey source rock geology and examine prior estimates of its resources. High-volume hydraulic fracturing in conjunction with long-reach horizontal wells is the key technological advance that has allowed source-rock production outside California. However. horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have not yet enabled commercial production of Monterey source rocks. One major barrier is that the Monterey is highly discontinuous–that is. rather than lying flat. it is folded and faulted. As a result. horizontal wells cannot run for great lengths along the Monterey Source Rock. and without a long well bore. it is difficult to conduct massive. multi-stage hydraulic fractures. We conclude that large-scale production from Monterey source rock is unlikely without some as-yet unforeseen technological advance.In order to fully understand the potential resources in the Monterey source rock. we recommend that the state commission a comprehensive. peer-reviewed probabilistic resource assessment of continuous-type (shale) oil resources in California. We undertake one important initial step in such a resource assessment by mapping the extent of potential Monterey-equivalent source rocks in California.

One of them. Spartina alterniflora. from the East Coast. has hybridized with the native S. foliosa and become highly invasive. These hybrids and their backcrosses are problematic to conservation objectives as they colonize nearly every ecological niche of a marsh – high and low marsh elevations. and across a range of salinities and sediment types. Where established. the hybrids inevitably pollen swap with native Spartina. creating yet more hybrids. With time. rare wetlands can be converted into uniform expanses of grass. Efforts to eradicate invasive Spartina have been based largely on visually identifying the most threatening. biggest. tallest and thickest. red-stemmed. big-flowered cordgrass plants and spraying these with herbicide. The strategy has been highly success- ful in reducing the invasion’s size – from about 800 net acres in 2005 to about 50 net acres in 2011.

The governing bodies of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are encouraging parties to adopt ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ (EbA) approaches. which utilise biodiversity and ecosystem services to support climate change adaptation. These approaches are wide ranging and include mangrove restoration to buffer against storm surges; watershed management to protect against droughts and floods; rangeland management to prevent desertification; and sustainable management of fisheries and forests to ensure food security.

Regulation of the River Murray. to supply water for irrigation. has changed the watering regime of the forest and thus is degrading its environmental values. The watering regime has been changed in two ways: (1) there are now fewer large winter/spring events that inundate extensive areas because these floods are mitigated by irrigation storages; and (2) there are more small summer/autumn events that flood low‐lying areas and are caused by the way the river is operated to supply irrigation demand. The increased frequency of these small unseasonal floods is the subject of this paper.During the irrigation season. water to meet irrigation requirements must be released four days in advance to allow for travel time from storages to irrigation areas upstream of the Barmah‐Millewa …,True,DLaocKYAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,43,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rra.705,14314269857674755609,/scholar?cites=14314269857674755609,,http://cfsites1.uts.edu.au/find/isf/publications/chongetal2003managementbarmahforest.pdf,0,0,0

Farmers need access to phosphate fertilizers to achieve the high crop yields needed to feed the world. Yet growing global demand for phosphorus could surpass supply in the coming decades. and the world currently largely relies on non-renewable phosphate rock that is mined in only a few countries. Morocco alone controls 75% of the remaining reserves. including those in the conflict territory of Western Sahara. While some argue that the market will take care of any scarcity. the market price of phosphate fertilizers fails to account for far-ranging negative impacts.

The SME sector is the economys largest employer and the largest contributor to GDP. Moreover. SMEs play a significant role within socio-economic systems: they provide employment. goods and services and tax revenue for communities. Climate change may result in adverse business outcomes including business interruptions. increased investment and insurance costs. and declines in financial indicators such as measures of value. return and growth. After natural disasters. SMEs face greater short-term losses than larger enterprises. and may have lower adaptive capacity for various reasons. This study examines the underlying factors and processes shaping adaptive capacity of Australian SMEs to climate change and associated sea level rise.

J.. 2005. Unseasonal flooding of the Barmah-Millewa Forest. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Victoria 117 (1): 127-137. ISSN 0035-9211. The Barmah-Millewa Forest is recognised in Australia and internationally as an ecologically significant site. However. river regulation has altered the frequency and pattern of forest flooding. and continues to have adverse environmental effects on the Forest. Compared to natural conditions. flooding is now less frequent in winter and spring and more frequent. unseasonally. in summer and autumn. In particular. small unseasonal floods that cover less than 10% of the forest are eight times more frequent now than before regulation. Unseasonal floods occur when rain leads to reductions in demand for water. Irrigators can cancel orders at short notice and water. which has already been released from upstream storages. continues downriver. Flooding occurs when these flows exceed the capacity of the reach of the river which flows through the forest. We explore the multiple factors that contribute to unseasonal flooding. These factors are related to the way the river regulation system-the infrastructure. rules and institutions-has been established and is operated to maintain the reliability of irrigation water supply. Options to reduce the incidence of unseasonal floods include: changes to the operating rules at Hume Reservoir and increasing airspace at Lake Mulwala.,True,DLaocKYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,8,https://www.academia.edu/download/45802169/Unseasonal_flooding_of_the_BarmahMillewa20160520-18300-ro342k.pdf,11217318129414602021,/scholar?cites=11217318129414602021,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45802169/Unseasonal_flooding_of_the_BarmahMillewa20160520-18300-ro342k.pdf,0,0,0

Peri-urban areas around the world have traditionally been the food bowls of our cities. Increasing urbanisation is threatening the existence of peri-urban agriculture. paving over the soils that have fed global city populations. Increasing conversion to commercial and residential uses. fragmentation. land-use conflicts and global challenges such as climate change pose a threat to the viability of food production in peri-urban areas. This report considers responses that might emerge from the planning system to address threats to peri-urban agriculture. The report focuses on the experience of peri-urban planning and food production in the Sydney Basin. in New South Wales. Australia The report reviews a range of planning responses to managing peri-urban areas for resilience and sustainability. These include strategic planning measures. financial incentives. property rights protections and improved methods for valuing the benefits that peri-urban agriculture provides to cities. For many cities. perhaps including Sydney. a large proportion of peri-urban food production has already been lost. converted to residential use and supporting infrastructure. For that which remains. and for those cities that have sustainably managed their peri-urban agricultural lands. policy and initiatives are required to ensure that food production on the urban fringe can continue to contribute to urban resilience in the future.,True,DLaocKYAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC,7,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/54408,14152104539469819344,/scholar?cites=14152104539469819344,,,0,0,0

(b) comprehensive aerosol measurements in four developing countries. (c) a database of airborne measurements of aerosols and clouds over Europe during May 2008. (d) comprehensive modeling tools to study aerosol processes fron nano to global scale and their effects on climate and air quality. In addition a new Pan-European aerosol emissions inventory was developed and evaluated. a new cluster spectrometer was built and tested in the field and several new aerosol parameterizations and computations modules for chemical transport and global climate models were developed and evaluated.

These exchanges play a major role in nutrient cycling and climate change related issues. An accurate representation of crop phenology and physiology is important in land-atmosphere carbon models being used to predict these exchanges. To better estimate time-varying exchanges of carbon. water. and energy of croplands using the Simple Biosphere (SiB) model. we developed crop-specific phenology models and coupled them to SiB. The coupled SiB-phenology model (SiBcrop) replaces remotely-sensed NDVI information. on which SiB originally relied for deriving Leaf Area Index (LAI) and the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR) for estimating carbon dynamics. The use of the new phenology scheme within SiB substantially improved the prediction of LAI and carbon fluxes for maize. soybean. and wheat crops. as compared with the observed data at several AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux tower sites in the US mid continent region. SiBcrop better predicted the onset and end of the growing season. harvest. interannual variability associated with crop rotation. day time carbon uptake (especially for maize) and day to day variability in carbon exchange. Biomass predicted by SiBcrop had good agreement with the observed biomass at field sites. In the future. we will predict fine resolution regional scale carbon and other exchanges by coupling SiBcrop with RAMS (the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System).,True,dlEd8d4AAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC,164,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/6/969/2009/,5809958511590037453,/scholar?cites=5809958511590037453,,https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/6/969/2009/bg-6-969-2009.pdf,0,0,0

The network uses very tall (> 300 m) television and radio transmitter towers that provide a convenient platform for mid-boundary-layer trace-gas sampling. Each analyzer has three sample inlets for profile sampling. and a complete vertical profile is obtained every 15 min. The instrument suite at one site has been augmented with a cavity ring-down spectrometer for measuring CO2 and CH4. The long-term stability of the systems in the field is typically better than 0.1 ppm for CO2. 6 ppb for CO. and 0.5 ppb for CH4. as determined from repeated standard gas measurements. The instrumentation is fully automated and includes sensors for measuring a variety of status parameters. such as temperatures. pressures. and flow rates. that are inputs for automated alerts and quality control algorithms. Detailed and time-dependent uncertainty estimates have been constructed for all of the gases. and the uncertainty framework could be readily adapted to other species or analysis systems. The design emphasizes use of off-the-shelf parts and modularity to facilitate network operations and ease of maintenance. The systems report high-quality data with > 93% uptime. Recurrent problems and limitations of the current system are discussed along with general recommendations for high-accuracy trace-gas monitoring.

This paper develops an alternative approach for modeling nucleation rates. based on a sequence of acid–base reactions. The model uses empirical estimates of sulfuric acid evaporation rates obtained from new measurements of neutral molecular clusters.

We collected in situ CO2. CO. and CH4 measurements and flask samples in the boundary layer and free troposphere over Sacramento. California. USA. during two aircraft flights over and downwind of this urban area during spring of 2009. The flask samples were analyzed for Δ14CO2 and CO2 to determine the recently added CO2ff mole fraction. A suite of greenhouse and other trace gases. including hydrocarbons and halocarbons. were measured in the same samples. Strong correlations were observed between CO2ff and numerous trace gases associated with urban emissions. From these correlations we estimate emission ratios between CO2ff and these species. and compare these with bottom-up inventory-derived estimates. Recent county level inventory estimates for carbon monoxide (CO) and benzene from the California Air Resources Board CEPAM database are in good agreement with our measured emission ratios. whereas older emissions inventories appear to overestimate emissions of these gases by a factor of two. For most other trace species. there are substantial differences (200–500%) between our measured emission ratios and those derived from available emission inventories. For the first flight. we combine in situ CO measurements with the measured CO:CO2ff emission ratio of 14 ± 2 ppbCO/ppmCO2 to derive an estimate of CO2ff mole fraction throughout this flight. and also estimate the biospheric CO2 mixing ratio (CO2bio) from the difference of total and fossil CO2.

Results show that compressed gas truck delivery is ideal for small stations and very low demand. liquid delivery is ideal for long distance delivery and moderate demand and pipeline delivery is ideal for dense areas with large hydrogen demand.,True,bo-vHgkAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,424,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319906001765,3473908979265795519,/scholar?cites=3473908979265795519,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0st9s56s/qt0st9s56s.pdf,0,0,0

At the top of the list of key issues are CCS costs: costs of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture. compression. transport. storage. and so on. This research report touches upon several of these cost components. It also provides some technical models for determining the engineering and infrastructure requirements of CCS. and describes some correlations for estimating CO2 density and viscosity. both of which are often essential properties for modeling CCS.

Driven by the notion “where you drive more is where you more likely need refueling”. this paper develops a new approach where station siting is treated as a “fuel-travel-back” problem and the only required data is the distribution of vehicle miles traveled. Such a fuel-travel-back problem is in nature a typical transportation problem and can be solved using a mix-integer-programming model. When the total fuel-travel-back time is minimized. so is the average refueling travel time of a random motorist. for which theoretical deduction is provided.

A characteristic parameter is the “learning rate.” defined as the fractional reduction in cost for each doubling of cumulative production or capacity. In this paper. a literature review of the learning rates reported for 11 power generation technologies employing an array of fossil fuels. nuclear. and renewable energy sources is presented.

Net global CO2 emissions. in particular. must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies. from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal. the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is. how do we get from here to there?   The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including. for example. the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways. including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third. how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future?   Two concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead. the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways.

This research report touches upon several of these cost components. It also provides some technical models for determining the engineering and infrastructure requirements of CCS. and describes some correlations for estimating CO2 density and viscosity. both of which are often essential properties for modeling CCS.

We find that although a relatively wide range of emissions in 2020—from 41 to 55 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO 2 e yr− 1)—may preserve the option of meeting a 2 C target. the size of this ‘feasibility window’strongly depends on the prospects of key energy technologies. and in particular on the effectiveness of efficiency measures to limit the growth of energy demand. A shortfall of critical technologies—either for technological or socio-political reasons—would narrow the feasibility window. if not close it entirely.

One of these challenges is energy; thus. the SDGs have become paramount for energy policy-making. Yet. while governments throughout the world have already declared the SDGs to be'integrated and indivisible'. there are still knowledge gaps surrounding how the interactions between the energy SDG targets and those of the non-energy-focused SDGs might play out in different contexts.

Paris,The report examines the interactions between the various goals and targets. determining to what extent they reinforce or conflict with each other. It provides a blueprint to help countries implement and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Countries around the world are faced with a significant challenge: How can they reach the 17 SDGs – and 169 targets that sit underneath these goals – by 2030? The SDGs. which were adopted by the international community in 2015. cover a diverse range of issues including gender equity. sustainable cities. access to clean water. and good governance. It is a big. unwieldly. ambitious agenda that – if it is successfully implemented – could set the world on a course toward inclusive. sustainable development.  The report proposes a seven-point scale to quantify these synergies and conflicts. The scale ranges from +3. which applies when one goal or target is very reinforcing of others. to -3. which applies when goals and targets conflict with each other. A score of 0 indicates neutral interaction.  The report includes detailed analysis of four SDGs and their interactions with other goals:           SDG2: Zero Hunger     SDG3: Good Health and Well-being     SDG7: Affordable and Clean Energy     SDG14: Life below Water,True,LjmiTtQAAAAJ:738O_yMBCRsC,155,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/14591/,5972631600377861438,/scholar?cites=5972631600377861438,,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/14591/1/SDGs-Guide-to-Interactions.pdf,0,0,0

The timing and rate of this phase-out will depend on the stringency of near-term climate policy and will have important implications for the stranding of coal power plant capacity without CCS. The objectives of this paper are to better understand the relationship between near-term climate policy and stranded coal capacity (assuming a long-term goal of limiting warming to 2 °C) and to explore strategies for reducing stranded capacity. Our analysis suggests that strengthening near-term climate policy (i.e.. lowering the global greenhouse gas emission target in 2030) generally reduces stranded coal capacity and its costs. An effective strategy for reducing stranded capacity is to minimize new construction of coal capacity without CCS. which can be accomplished by …,True,LjmiTtQAAAAJ:ZeXyd9-uunAC,131,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162514000924,3459118242342000622,/scholar?cites=3459118242342000622,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162514000924,0,0,0

The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First. what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways. including the goal itself. the emissions pathway to the goal. technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation. the nature of international coordination. and mitigation policies? Second. what are the key characteristics of different transformation pathways. including the rates of emissions reductions and deployment of low-carbon energy. the magnitude and timing of aggregate economic costs. and the implications for other policy objectives such as those generally associated with sustainable development?

Limitations on data and methodology typically ensure that models have various strengths and weaknesses. requiring researchers to make tradeoffs when choosing models. In the case of energy systems. a frequent distinction is between “top down” models (eg. computable general equilibrium. or CGE models) that address energy systems within the context of the larger economy. versus “bottom up” models (eg. so-‐called E4. or “energy/economy/environment/engineering” models). that model the energy system at a much higher level of detail. but simplify the relationship to the rest of the economy. Most attention has been on integrating these two types of models. However. researchers have also been concerned that E4 models. despite their vaunted high level of detail. produce results that are an unrealistic representation of consumer market behavior. calling into question their value for making policy decisions. This is particularly true for household vehicle technology choice. an important sub-‐sector of the energy system.At the same time. there is a large and well-‐established literature on modeling household vehicle choice and usage decisions (using discrete and discrete-‐continuous models). But. the methods and approaches used in this literature differ dramatically from those used in E4 models. and so it has been unclear how to bridge the gap.

A particular emphasis has been given to battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). with many nations investing in improving their charging infrastructure and incentivising electric vehicle purchasing through offering grant schemes and tax relief to consumers. Despite these incentives. the uptake of BEVs and PHEVs has been low. while some countries. such as Ireland and Denmark. are in the process of removing the tax relief currently in place. This initial retraction has already been met with a fall in sales of BEVs and PHEVs. which is expected to continue decreasing as these incentives are further reduced.

Energy system modeling can help us understand the nature of the technological. resource and behavioral changes that are needed to limit emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs).CA-TIMES is a model of the California energy system that has been under development for almost a decade and was inspired by the ambitious targets that were put forward by the Governor of California in 2005 and 2006. and the passage of AB32. Governor Schwarzenegger laid out an extremely ambitious target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. This target laid out a grand challenge for the state of how to achieve a major transformation of the energy system to reduce the amount of energy the state and rely on low carbon energy sources. There is a significant amount of uncertainty about the evolution of the energy system many decades in the future. so the initial goal of analyses tasked with answering questions about meeting these targets was to understand what sorts of possible futures might conceivably meet the GHG goals. Among these possible futures. a next step was to identify the lowest-cost way (or relatively inexpensive ways) to achieve these goals. A number of modeling and system analyses have been performed over the years with the goal of improving our understanding of the mitigation options for California (eg Morrison et al 2014.

1188975,Development of Integrated Vehicle and Fuel Scenarios in a National Energy System Model for Low Carbon US Transportation Futures,2018,Christopher Yang and Saleh Zakerinia and Kalai Ramea and Marshall Miller,,,,,,Transportation is a major emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States accounting for 27% of the country’s emissions. second only to the electricity sector. As a result. reducing GHG emissions are essential for mitigating some of the most damaging potential impacts associated with climate change and because of the importance and relative size of the transportation sector. it would need to contribute a significant amount of emissions reduction.This report describes the development and use of an U.S. energy system optimization model (US-TIMES) in order to analyze the reductions in GHG emissions that can come about through policy targets.  These policy targets induce technology investments and operation in order to satisfy the demand for energy services and environmental policy constraints (notably GHG emission targets).The model development focused on two key areas within the transportation sector. light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles.  In the light-duty space. we incorporated consumer choice elements into the energy system optimization framework through increasing consumer heterogeneity and adding non-monetary decision factors such as risk and fueling inconvenience.  For heavy-duty vehicles. we adopt a segmentation approach and update vehicle cost and performance assumptions from our recent work. The model is used to project scenarios for low carbon futures from a reference scenario all the way to an 80% GHG reduction target.View the NCST Project Webpage,True,LhUbdVoAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,0,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9cb5t3k4,,,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt9cb5t3k4/qt9cb5t3k4.pdf,0,0,0

Berkeley. CA (US),This study used a state-of-the-art planning model called SWITCH for the electric power system to investigate the evolution of the power systems of California and western North America from present-day to 2050 in the context of deep decarbonization of the economy. Researchers concluded that drastic power system carbon emission reductions were feasible by 2050 under a wide range of possible futures. The average cost of power in 2050 would range between $149 to $232 per megawatt hour across scenarios. a 21 to 88 percent increase relative to a business-as-usual scenario. and a 38 to 115 percent increase relative to the present-day cost of power. The power system would need to undergo sweeping change to rapidly decarbonize. Between present-day and 2030 the evolution of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system was dominated by implementing aggressive energy efficiency measures. installing renewable energy and gas-fired generation facilities and retiring coal-fired generation. Deploying wind. solar and geothermal power in the 2040 timeframe reduced power system emissions by displacing gas-fired generation.

Increased variable generation resource penetration connected to the bulk power system. as well as. distributed energy resources (DERs) connected to the distribution system affect the grid’s reliable operation over many different time scales (eg. days to hours to minutes to seconds). As the state continues this transition. it will require careful planning to ensure resources with the right characteristics are available to meet changing grid management needs. Demand response (DR) has the potential to provide important resources for keeping the electricity grid stable and efficient. to defer upgrades to generation. transmission and distribution systems. and to deliver customer economic benefits. This study estimates the potential size and cost of future DR resources for California’s three investor-owned utilities (IOUs): Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E).

Researchers concluded that drastic power system carbon emission reductions were feasible by 2050 under a wide range of possible futures. The average cost of power in 2050 would range between $149 to $232 per megawatt hour across scenarios. a 21 to 88 percent increase relative to a business-as-usual scenario. and a 38 to 115 percent increase relative to the present-day cost of power. The power system would need to undergo sweeping change to rapidly decarbonize. Between present-day and 2030 the evolution of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council power system was dominated by implementing aggressive energy efficiency measures. installing renewable energy and gas-fired generation facilities and retiring coal-fired generation. Deploying wind. solar and geothermal power in the 2040 timeframe reduced power system emissions by displacing gas-fired generation.

The stated preference (SP) data elicited households' preferences among gasoline. electric. methanol. and compressed natural gas vehicles with various attributes. The mixed logit models provide improved fits over logit that are highly significant. and show large heterogeneity in respondents' preferences for alternative-fuel vehicles. The effects of including this heterogeneity are demonstrated in forecasting exercises. The alternative-fuel vehicle models presented here also highlight the advantages of merging SP and revealed preference (RP) data.

A central theme is that any one data source (e.g.. a scanner panel source) is often insufficient to support tests of complex theories of choice and decision making. Hence. analysts may need to embrace a wider variety of data types and measurement tools than traditionally have been considered in applied decision making and choice research. We discuss the viability of preference-stationarity assumptions usually made when pooling data. as well as random-utility theory-based approaches for combining data sources.

Planners concerned with energy consumption. air quality and the provision of transportation facilities must have dependable forecasts of vehicle ownership and use from both the residential (personal-use vehicle) sectors and the fleet (commercial and governmental sectors). As long as vehicles evolved slowly. it was possible to base such forecasts on extrapolations of observed demand. However. in an era of increasing environmental awareness. mandated in part by the US Clean Air Act Amendments (US EPA. 1990). government agencies are now concerned with promoting clean-fuel vehicles; vehicle manufacturers are faced with designing and marketing clean-fuel vehicles; and suppliers of fuels other than gasoline must plan infrastructure and pricing policies.,True,_4vMS7UAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,60,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0xs9c8p6,11539196794294668195,/scholar?cites=11539196794294668195,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt0xs9c8p6/qt0xs9c8p6.pdf,0,0,0

Quantitative market research information about how consumers are likely to respond to alternative-fuel vehicles is critical to the development of policies aimed at encouraging such technological change. In 1991. a three-phase stated preference (SP) survey was implemented in the South Coast Air Basin of California to predict the effect on personal vehicle purchases of attributes that potentially differentiate clean-fuel vehicles from conventional gasoline (or diesel) vehicles.

The first two methods reveal that ignoring daily variation in VMT always causes underestimation of petroleum consumption and overestimation of electricity consumption by PHEVs; both biases increase as the assumed PHEV charge-depleting (CD) range moves closer to the average daily VMT. The empirical analysis based on national travel survey data shows that the assumption of uniform daily VMT over time and among drivers causes nearly 68 …,True,fQ4QCeoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,40,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2252-13,8339269527355835208,/scholar?cites=8339269527355835208,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhenhong_Lin/publication/272719019_Assessing_Energy_Impact_of_Plug-In_Hybrid_Electric_Vehicles/links/5b031dda0f7e9be94bdabe69/Assessing-Energy-Impact-of-Plug-In-Hybrid-Electric-Vehicles.pdf,0,0,0

The approach uses longitudinal travel data and thus allows more realistic analysis of the impact of the charging infrastructure on BEV feasibility. BEV feasibility is defined as the probability that the ratio of the distance traveled between charges to the BEV range is kept within a comfort level (i.e.. drivers are comfortable with driving the BEV when the battery's state of charge is above a certain level). When the ratio exceeds the comfort level. travel adaptation is needed–-use of a substitute vehicle. choice of an alternative transportation mode. or cancellation of a trip.

KGaA Weinheim,Signiﬁcant efforts in recent decades have been focused on the direct electrochemical oxidation of alcohol and hydrocarbon fuels. Organic liquid fuels are characterized by high energy density. whereas the electromotive force associated with their electrochemical combustion to CO2 is comparable to that of hydrogen combustion to water [1–3]. Among the liquid organic fuels. methanol has promising characteristics in terms of reactivity at low temperatures. storage and handling. Accordingly. a methanol-feed proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) would help to alleviate some of the issues surrounding fuel storage and processing for fuel cells. Technological improvements in DMFCs are. thus. fuelled by their perspectives on applications in portable. transportation and stationary systems especially with regard to the remote and distributed generation of electrical energy [4. 5]. Methanol is cheap and can be distributed by using the present infrastructure for liquid fuels. It can be obtained from fossil fuels. such as natural gas or coal. as well as from sustainable sources through fermentation of agricultural products and from biomasses. Compared with ethanol. methanol has the signiﬁcant advantage of high selectivity to CO2 formation in the electrochemical oxidation process [1–3]. However. despite these practical system beneﬁts. DMFCs are characterized by a signiﬁcantly lower power density and lower efﬁciency than a PEMFC operating with hydrogen because of the slow oxidation kinetics of methanol and methanol crossover from the anode to the cathode [1–3].This chapter deals with an analysis of the history. current status of technology …,True,r5sizTwAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,101,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xHsJJieZlHwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:_CkuXwF5Ry8J:scholar.google.com&ots=iFVAHIbEh6&sig=GtPvJOVoGITWVOvZYdRlG1dQ-sY,3406824689927858684,/scholar?cites=3406824689927858684,,,0,0,0

The present X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) study on carbon-supported Pt. Pt–Co and Pt–Co–Cr electrocatalysts suggests the presence of a relatively lower Pt-oxide content on the alloys. The X-ray powder diffraction patterns for these electrocatalysts show that while the carbon-supported platinum electrocatalyst has a face-centered cubic (fcc) phase. carbon-supported Pt–Co and Pt–Co–Cr electrocatalysts …,True,GVZVdM0AAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,384,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016943320000831X,11829755472642341541,/scholar?cites=11829755472642341541,,,0,0,0

Indeed. these nickel oxide or hydroxide electrodes are pure battery-type electrodes which store charges through faradaic processes as can be shown by cyclic voltammograms or constant current galvanostatic charge/discharge plots.

1189168,Assessing low-carbon fuel technology innovation through a Technology Innovation System approach,2015,Jeff Kessler,,,,,,While the existing work on technology innovation is abundant. the innovation process largely remains a “black box.” shrouded in mystery. Energy models that incorporate innovation concepts. such as experience curves. fail to consider the fundamental processes that drive innovation. This dissertation research establishes a set of methodological approaches to better break in to this innovation black box. aiding in the quantification of the more qualitative approaches to innovation. These methods are applied to better examine low-carbon technology innovation in transportation. Specifically. this dissertation looks at biofuel innovation and the more recent diffusion of electric vehicles. Patent trends. one traditional approach for quantifying innovations. are used to provide a point of comparison for the novel methodologies employed. This research shows that the innovation narrative and conclusions that can be drawn from patent data are largely dependent on how patents are classified. Employing statistical models in conjunction with computational linguistics and machine-learning algorithms. it is possible to classify large bodies of text. This methodology is applied to a large selection of patents to better classify biofuel technologies. Additionally. this method is applied to a large repository of textual media. such as newspaper articles and trade journals. to select for specific technologies. and to classify articles by the type of information they convey.

1189169,Credit Multipliers as a Mechanism to Incentivize Low-Carbon Fuel Policy Adoption and to Reduce Fuel Shuffling,2013,Jeff Kessler and Sonia Yeh,,,13-103,,USAEE Working Paper,Low-carbon fuel policies such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) encourage the use of low-carbon fuels through different incentive mechanisms. One outcome of these market-based designs is that incentives for fuel shuffling exist for low carbon intensity fuels. Fuel shuffling reduces policy efficiency and potentially increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to transport. One way to address this inefficiency is to differentiate a commodity through the use of certification (eg GHG emissions or sustainability standards). We argue that decoupling certificates from physical quantities of fuel will mitigate shuffling concerns. improve the economic efficiency of fuel regulation. and better incentivize technology innovation for fuels. Use of decoupled certificates may also circumvent concerns associated with the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade regulation by the World Trade Organization. While this analysis indicates that certificate decoupling adds substantial value to low-carbon fuel policy. the policy may also be inefficient if decoupling incentivizes paper shuffling. We propose using credit multipliers in addition to certificate decoupling to overcome this problem. This approach may provide economic benefits of over $50 billion dollars for the trade of ethanol between the US and Brazil alone.,True,LWKDPFgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2205512,10645345042540823165,/scholar?cites=10645345042540823165,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40625693/Credit_Multipliers_as_a_Mechanism_to_Inc20151203-9389-1y59gd5.pdf,0,0,0

1189171,Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions Through National Ambient Air Quality Standards: The Role of Regional Low Carbon Fuel Standards,2013,Jeff Kessler and Benjamin VanGessel,,,,,International Association for Energy Economics,Classification of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) may effectively trigger a form of cap and trade policy that promotes reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a regional basis over time. While economy-wide cap and trade policy supports abatement at the lowest possible cost. it is not the most effective option for reducing GHG emissions in the transportation sector. Instead. we propose that transportation emission reductions be addressed through a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) implemented through State Implementation Plans. Regional LCFS implementations may interact differently in isolation than when they are harmonized. We have modeled LCFS implementation in New Jersey. Oregon. Vermont. and Washington in isolation and as an aggregated region to reflect what could occur under NAAQS-based LCFS implementation. Results indicate that harmonized standards across regions may substantially ease the burden of transitioning away from gasoline and diesel compared to isolated regional standards. Additionally. the existing implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator model does not account for life-cycle GHG emissions. meaning that fuel policy will not factor into State Implementation Plans unless modifications to the model are made to account for life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions associated with fuel types.,True,LWKDPFgAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff_Kessler/publication/272300901_Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Reductions_Through_National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards_The_Role_of_Regional_Low_Carbon_Fuel_Standards/links/553667270cf218056e94e9d5,443494480991684986,/scholar?cites=443494480991684986,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff_Kessler/publication/272300901_Greenhouse_Gas_Emission_Reductions_Through_National_Ambient_Air_Quality_Standards_The_Role_of_Regional_Low_Carbon_Fuel_Standards/links/553667270cf218056e94e9d5,0,0,0

This research looks at shifts in the biofuel technology innovation system over time. and discusses the role that key government policies may have had in promoting successful technology innovation. Through the use of Natural Language Processing alongside machine learning algorithms. we assess shifts in biofuel technology innovation across several hundred firms.

For the case of biofuels. there have been two periods of innovation; one associated with a strong coalition of agricultural firms. and a second period marked by disparate biotechnology firms working to secure a poorly defined niche market. Data show that government policy may have encouraged and facilitated innovation activity for 1st generation biofuels. but may have been largely ineffective at encouraging knowledge development and diffusion for 2nd generation technologies. Our data indicate that 2nd generation biofuels are far from market maturity compared to 1st generation biofuels. and that new government policy approaches may be necessary to better promote knowledge development and diffusion. or use of these 2nd generation biofuels may remain limited.,True,LWKDPFgAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=fgx2BwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA299&dq=info:kNUdvr7MZTEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3icG_TZLeM&sig=mwNuLPIs-nKvF0fEbeEDSHVvT_g,,,,,0,0,0

This paper explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) alongside machine learning algorithms to assess shifts in biofuel technology innovation. The full background text of over 755.000 patents from the US Patent and Trademark Office patent database has been analyzed and classified using the Stanford NLP Classifier. This process provided a clean set of biofuel patent data compared to what has previously been done in the literature. and research and development (R&D) trends from this analysis were explored in the context of biofuel policies. The authors found that the primary US policy affecting biofuels. the Renewable Fuel Standard. seems to have had limited impact on promoting innovation and patenting activity for 2nd generation fuels. but may have played a large role in encouraging the proliferation of entrepreneurial firms into the market. The authors conclude that. at this time. policies should be directed toward establishing networks. supply chains. and technology and knowledge sharing across firms already operating in this space to share learning and promote targeted technology outcomes.,True,LWKDPFgAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://trid.trb.org/view/1336559,,,,,0,0,0

1189194,Optimizing the design of biomass hydrogen supply chains using real-world spatial distributions: a case study using California rice straw,2007,Nathan C Parker,,,,,,The cost of hydrogen from biomass is not well understood due to the trade-offs between economies of scale at the production facility and diseconomies of scale in the feedstock collection and hydrogen delivery. The hydrogen delivery portion of the cost is particularly hard to understand because three modes of delivery exist with very different cost functions. In order to estimate the cost of hydrogen from biomass. it is necessary to develop an understanding of how these three stages of the supply chain will interact in an optimal system.  This paper develops a methodology to optimize full supply chains for producing hydrogen from dispersed biomass resources and delivering it to the drivers of hydrogen vehicles at refueling stations. A profit maximizing model of the supply chain for use with real-world geographic information is formulated in a mixed integer-non-linear program. The model chooses the optimal number. location. and size of conversion facilities along with the fields that supply each facility and which demands are served by which facilities. In the process the optimal mode of hydrogen delivery is chosen. Engineering-economic models of the cost of each part of the supply chain were developed from literature during model development. A case study using rice straw to produce hydrogen in northern California is presented as a demonstration of the method.   The rice straw case study demonstrated that hydrogen from biomass could be competitive with the projected costs of the distributed production of hydrogen by steam methane reformation (SMR).

1189199,Modeling future biofuel supply chains using spatially explicit infrastructure optimization,2011,Nathan Parker,,,,,,Policies have been enacted that promote biofuels with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. reduce dependence on petroleum and to spur rural economic growth. The supply of biofuels that can meet these three goals is limited. The cost of this supply is influenced by the geography of the biomass resource and demand for fuels. Existing studies projecting the future supply have not accounted for the spatial aspects of the biofuel supply in detail. This dissertation presents a spatially explicit model of future biofuel supply chains in the United States. with the goal of providing supply curves of biofuels by resource-technology pathway with detailed accounting of the required infrastructure. The model is used to analyze the potential supply of biofuels for meeting the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) and analyze biofuels from waste and residue resources in California at high resolution with accounting for air pollutant emissions. The results of the national case study project that domestic biofuels can achieve the RFS2 mandates for 2022 at fuel prices of between $3.4 and $5 per gasoline gallon equivalent. The largest sources of variation are the cost of cellulosic biofuel technologies and the availability of low cost waste resources. Building the 200-250 cellulosic biorefineries needed to achieve the target requires a capital investment greater than $100 billion but less than $360 billion depending on technology development and choice of cellulosic technology.

Agriculture and Natural Resources,Biomass constitutes a major renewable energy resource for California. with more than          30 million tons per year of in-state production estimated to be available on a sustainable          basis for electricity generation. biofuels production and other industrial processing.          Annually. biofuel production from these resources could exceed 2 billion gallons of          gasoline equivalent. while providing opportunities for agricultural and rural economic          development. Continuing research and large-scale demonstrations now under way will          test alternative technologies and provide much-needed information regarding costs          and environmental performance. Biomass can help meet state goals for increasing the          amounts of electricity and fuels from renewable resources under the Renewable Portfolio          Standard (RPS) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). and can similarly help meet          national biofuel targets under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

They find that a small. cost-effective intervention in markets could support a transition to a commercially sustainable natural gas heavy-duty fueling system in the state of California and that this could also advance some of the state’s air quality goals. The research shows that an initial advanced natural gas fueling system in California could facilitate the expansion to other US states. Such a network would enable a faster transition to renewable natural gas or biogas and waste-to-energy pathways. Stricter efficiency standards for natural gas Class 8 trucks and regulation of methane leakage along the natural gas supply chain would be necessary for natural gas to contribute substantially to California’s climate goals as a trucking fuel.

1189213,Batteries for plug-in hybrid electric Vehicles (PHEVs): goals and the state of technology circa 2008,2008,Jonn Axsen and Andy Burke and Kenneth S Kurani,,,,,,This report discusses the development of advanced batteries for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) applications. We discuss the basic design concepts of PHEVs. compare three sets of influential technical goals. and explain the inherent trade-offs in PHEV battery design. We then discuss the current state of several battery chemistries. including nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium-ion (Li-Ion). comparing their abilities to meet PHEV goals. and potential trajectories for further improvement. Four important conclusions are highlighted. First. PHEV battery “goals” vary according to differing assumptions of PHEV design. performance. use patterns and consumer demand. Second. battery development is constrained by inherent tradeoffs among five main battery attributes: power. energy. longevity. safety and cost. Third. Li-Ion battery designs are better suited to meet the demands of more aggressive PHEV goals than the NiMH batteries currently used for HEVs. Fourth. the flexible nature of Li-Ion technology. as well as concerns over safety. has prompted several alternate paths of continued technological development. Due to the differences among these development paths. the attributes of one type of Li-Ion battery cannot necessarily be generalized to other types. This paper is not intended to be a definitive analysis of technologies; instead. it is more of a primer for battery non-experts. providing the perspective and tools to help understand and critically review research on PHEV batteries.,True,Q6LkV4MAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,176,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1bp83874,10867423441272872019,/scholar?cites=10867423441272872019,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt1bp83874/qt1bp83874.pdf,0,0,0

1189225,The early US market for PHEVs: Anticipating consumer awareness. recharge potential. design priorities and energy impacts,2008,Jonn Axsen and Kenneth S Kurani,,,,,,Vehicles that can run on both electricity and gasoline—so-called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)—are proposed as both a near-term technology to achieve energy and environmental goals and a transitional step toward viable all-electric vehicles addressing many of the same goals. Whether PHEVs meet any of their goals depends not only on their design and performance on standardized drive cycles. but also on drivers’ travel and refueling/recharging behaviors. To replace assumptions with observations of potential PHEV drivers’ behavior in market and impact analyses. we conducted an internet-based survey of 2.373 new car-buying households in the United States. The instrument was implemented in three separate pieces. requiring multiple days for households to answer questions. conduct a review of their own driving and parking patterns. and then complete a sequence of PHEV design exercises. In this paper. we draw five conclusions from the resulting data.

1189226,Moving beyond alternative fuel hype to decarbonize transportation,2016,Noel Melton and Jonn Axsen and Daniel Sperling,1,Nature Energy,3,1-10,Nature Publishing Group,In the past three decades. government. industry and other stakeholders have repeatedly been swept up with the ‘fuel du jour’. claiming that a particular alternative fuel vehicle (AFV) technology can succeed in replacing conventional gasoline-powered vehicles. However. AFV technologies have experienced relatively little success. with fossil fuels still accounting for about 95% of global transport energy use. Here. using the US as a case study. we conduct a media analysis to show how society’s attention has skipped among AFV types between 1980 and 2013. including methanol. natural gas. plug-in electric. hybrid electric. hydrogen and biofuels. Although our results provide no indication as to whether hype ultimately has a net positive or negative impact on AFV innovation. we offer several recommendations that governments can follow to move past hype to support significant AFV adoption and displace fossil fuel …,True,Q6LkV4MAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,87,https://www.nature.com/articles/nenergy201613,3202646456293518936,/scholar?cites=3202646456293518936,,https://steps.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nenergy201613.pdf,0,0,0
1189227,Is awareness of public charging associated with consumer interest in plug-in electric vehicles?,2015,Joseph Bailey and Amy Miele and Jonn Axsen,36,Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment,,1-9,Pergamon,Policymakers often seek to increase the visibility of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) chargers in public locations in effort to build familiarity and interest in PEVs. However. it is not clear if the visibility of public charging stations actually has an impact on PEV demand. The purposes of the present study are to (1) assess the current levels of visibility for public PEV charging infrastructure within Canada and (2) identify whether or not a statistically significant relationship exists between consumer awareness of public charging infrastructure and interest in purchasing a PEV. We use data collected from a sample of 1739 Canadian new-vehicle buyers in 2013. About 18% of Canadian respondents have seen at least one public charger. while the proportion is highest in British Columbia (31%).

Controlling for demographic characteristics and perceptions of ecological threat. more frequent engagement in pro-environmental behaviors predicted higher life satisfaction. All but 2 of 39 PEBs were positively related to life satisfaction. suggesting that the relationship generalizes across behaviors. However. life satisfaction was more strongly predicted by behaviors that involved more social interaction. behaviors that were more easily observed. and by behaviors that involved direct costs in terms of money. time. and effort. Evidence for the role of direct costs was stronger than that for socialness or observability.

We draw from sociological and psychological literature to develop a conceptual framework that reflexively links an individual's values and self-concept to their behaviors. We inductively explore the consideration. and in some cases development. of sustainability-oriented values in a small number of narrative accounts of peoples’ encounter with a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle during a multi-week trial.

Some studies of climate policy support assume that a significant number of citizens need to be aware of the policies in question and able to provide informed opinions. In this study. we probe this assumption using a web-based survey of residents of the Canadian province of British Columbia (n = 475) by assessing: (1) citizen awareness and knowledge of climate policies.

The Netherlands. 19-21 September 2007. This report is the culmination of the combined efforts of the New Scenarios Steering Committee. an author team composed primarily of members of the research community. and numerous other meeting participants and external reviewers who provided extensive comments during the expert review process. The expert meeting included presentations focused on needs for scenarios as seen from a policymaking perspective. a review of past IPCC scenarios. overviews of evolving plans in the research community. needs and opportunities for scenarios on two different time scales ('near term' to 2035. and 'long term' to 2100. extended to 2300 for some applications). and a review of options for the benchmark scenarios. referred to in the report as 'Representative Concentration Pathways' (RCPs). Additional presentations addressed institutional issues and options for increasing participation by developing and transition-economy countries. The remainder of the meeting was organized around a series of breakout groups and plenary sessions that provided an opportunity for the research communities to further coordinate their plans. to refine the proposal for the RCPs. and to consider additional cross-cutting issues.

The scenarios both provide inputs to climate models and also assist in assessing the relative importance of relevant trace gases and aerosol precursors in changing atmospheric composition and hence climate. Scenarios can also help lo improve the understanding of key relationships among factors that drive future emissions.Scenarios are not predictions of the future and should not be used as such. This becomes increasingly true as the time horizon increases. because the basis for the underlying assumptions becomes increasingly speculative. Considerable uncertainties surround the evolution of the types and levels of human activities (including economic growth and structure). technological advances. and human responses to possible environmental. economic and institutional constraints. Since completion of the 1990 Scenario A (SA90). events and new information have emerged which relate to that scenario's underlying assumptions.

Historically. the most common approach to integrated assessment has been the attempt by individual researchers or research teams to integrate the information available from the relevant disciplines and provide policy advice in books and reports. Although this has typically been accomplished via informed qualitative linkages. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) use a computer program to link an array of component models based on mathematical representations of information from the various contributing disciplines. This approach makes it easier to ensure consistency among the assumptions input to the various components of the models. but may tend to constrain the type of information that can be used to what is explicitly represented in the model. IAMs can be divided into two broad classes: policy optimization models and policy evaluation models. Policy optimization models optimize key policy control variables such as carbon emission control rates or carbon taxes. given formulated policy goals (eg. maximizing welfare or minimizing the cost of meeting a carbon emission or concentration target).

A multi‐region applied general equilibrium model. which includes relevant CAP measures. is used to obtain a quantitative assessment and to analyse the effects of alternative world market price changes on the fulfilment of these commitments.

One policy response is to regulate red and processed meat consumption similar to other carcinogens and foods of public health concerns. Here we describe a market-based approach of taxing red and processed meat according to its health impacts.   Methods We calculated economically optimal tax levels for 149 world regions that would account for (internalize) the health costs associated with ill-health from red and processed meat consumption. and we used a coupled modelling framework to estimate the impacts of optimal taxation on consumption. health costs. and non-communicable disease mortality. Health impacts were estimated using a global comparative risk assessment framework. and economic responses were estimated using international data on health costs. prices. and price elasticities.   Findings The health-related costs to society attributable to red and processed meat consumption in 2020 amounted to USD 285 billion (sensitivity intervals based on epidemiological uncertainty (SI). 93–431). three quarters of which were due to processed meat consumption.

An important assumption thereby is that biofuels replace the production and consumption of oil. However. recent literature challenges this assumption. because an increased use of biofuels will lower oil prices and therefore result in increase crude oil consumption. This so-called rebound effect offsets the expected GHG emission saving effects of using biofuels. A review of eight studies. mainly on current and future US biofuel policies. provides insights in the current state of research into this topic. showing a wide range of values of the rebound effect of biofuel use. depending among others on the biofuel policy. the applied method and the model parameter assumptions.

This paper focuses primarily on the requirements to limit radiative forcing from Kyoto gases to 2.6 W/m2. Given that we estimate year 2005 radiative forcing to be 2.4 W/m2. the 2.6 W/m2 limit creates a non-trivial constraint. Allowing radiative forcing to exceed the long-term target level provides greater latitude in achieving the goal. but implies major changes to both global energy and land-use systems in the near term as well as the long term.

SSPs depict five global situations with substantially different socio-economic conditions. In the accompanying paper. a water use scenario compatible with the SSPs was developed. This scenario considers not only quantitative socio-economic factors such as population and electricity production but also qualitative ones such as the degree of technological change and overall environmental consciousness. In this paper. water availability and water scarcity were assessed using a global hydrological model called H08. H08 simulates both the natural water cycle and major human activities such as water abstraction and reservoir operation. It simulates water availability and use at daily time intervals at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°. A series of global hydrological simulations were conducted under the SSPs. taking into account different climate policy options and the results of climate models. Water scarcity was assessed using an index termed the Cumulative Abstraction to Demand ratio. which is expressed as the accumulation of daily water abstraction from a river divided by the daily consumption-based potential water demand. This index can be used to express whether renewable water resources are available from rivers when required. The results suggested that by 2071–2100 the population living under severely water-stressed conditions for SSP1-5 will reach 2588–2793 × 106 (39–42% of total population). 3966–4298 × 106 (46–50%). 5334–5643 × 10 …,True,SSSsd3MAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,224,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2393/2013/,8969204413930679325,/scholar?cites=8969204413930679325,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2393/2013/hess-17-2393-2013.pdf,0,0,0

In this first paper. water use scenarios are presented for the latest global hydrological models. The scenarios are compatible with the socio-economic scenarios of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs). which are a part of the latest set of scenarios on global change developed by the integrated assessment. the IAV (climate change impact. adaptation. and vulnerability assessment). and the climate modeling community. The SSPs depict five global situations based on substantially different socio-economic conditions during the 21st century. Water use scenarios were developed to reflect not only quantitative socio-economic factors. such as population and electricity production. but also key qualitative concepts such as the degree of technological change and overall environmental consciousness. Each scenario consists of five factors: irrigated area. crop intensity. irrigation efficiency. and withdrawal-based potential industrial and municipal water demands. The first three factors are used to estimate the potential irrigation water demand. All factors were developed using simple models based on a literature review and analysis of historical records. The factors are grid-based at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° and cover the whole 21st century in five-year intervals. Each factor shows wide variation among the different global situations depicted: the irrigated area in 2085 varies between 2.7 × 106 and 4.5 × 106 km2. withdrawal-based potential industrial water demand between 246 and 1714 km3 yr−1. and municipal water between 573 and 1280 km3 yr …,True,SSSsd3MAAAAJ:P5F9QuxV20EC,154,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2375/2013/,6836912460059193682,/scholar?cites=6836912460059193682,,https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/17/2375/2013/hess-17-2375-2013.pdf,0,0,0

Integrated assessment model results for 14 different emissions species and 13 emissions sectors are provided for each scenario with consistent transitions from the historical data used in CMIP6 to future trajectories using automated harmonization before being downscaled to provide higher emissions source spatial detail. We find that the scenarios span a wide range of end-of-century radiative forcing values. thus making this set of scenarios ideal for exploring a variety of warming pathways. The set of scenarios is bounded on the low end by a 1.9 W m−2 scenario. ideal for analyzing a world with end-of-century temperatures well below 2 ∘C. and on the high end by a 8.5 W m−2 scenario. resulting in an increase in warming of nearly 5 ∘C over pre-industrial levels.

The authors confirm the findings of other research that unilateral emissions cuts by industrial countries will have minimal carbon leakage effects.

A key factor affecting the impact of any border taxes is whether they are based on the carbon content of imports or the carbon content in domestic production.

The results present striking evidence on the wide variation in the carbon-intensiveness of trade across countries. with major developing countries being large net exporters of virtual carbon. Our analysis suggests that a tax on virtual carbon could lead to very substantial effective tariff rates on the exports of the most carbon-intensive developing nations.

This study simulates the potential impact of COVID-19 on gross domestic product and trade. using a standard global computable general equilibrium model. It models the shock as underutilization of labor and capital. an increase in international trade costs. a drop in travel services. and a redirection of demand away from activities that require proximity between people. A baseline global pandemic scenario sees gross domestic product fall by 2 percent below the benchmark for the world. 2.5 percent for developing countries. and 1.8 percent for industrial countries. The declines are nearly 4 percent below the benchmark for the world. in an amplified pandemic scenario in which containment is assumed to take longer and which now seems more likely. The biggest negative shock is recorded in the output of domestic services affected by the pandemic. as well as in traded tourist services. Since the model does not capture fully the social isolation induced independent contraction in demand and the decline in investor confidence. the eventual economic impact may be different. This exercise is illustrative. because it is still too early to make an informed assessment of the full impact of the pandemic.

We show how trade and environment linkages give rise to complex second-best policy issues and derive optimal interventions and sufficient conditions for welfare-improving piecemeal trade and environmental policy reforms in a small economy. Changing trade and environment distortions in proportion to their optimal levels increases welfare. We decompose the economic and environment effects of policies targeted at trade and pollution in both consumption and production. We also decompose production responses into output adjustments and changes in pollution intensities. /// Liens entre commerce international et environnement: réforme à la pièce et l'intervention optimale.

In its standard version. it is a neo-classical model with both factor and goods market clearing. It features three production archetypes—crops. livestock. and other—. a full range of tax instruments. price markups. multiple labor skills. vintage capital. and energy as an input combined with capital. Trade is modeled using nested Armington and production transformation structures to determine bilateral trade flows. Tariffs are fully bilateral and the model captures international trade and transportation costs—both direct and indirect (using iceberg trade costs). The latest version of the model also implements tariff rate quotas (TRQs). A recursive framework is used to drive dynamics. with savings-led investment and productivity. The model incorporates adjustment costs in capital markets and traderesponsive endogenous productivity.,True,EcuvSvIAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,137,https://vi.unctad.org/tda/papers/CGE%20Models_Marco/Mensbrugghe%20(2005)%20LinkageTechnical%20Reference%20Doc.pdf,10139076134348066287,/scholar?cites=10139076134348066287,,https://vi.unctad.org/tda/papers/CGE%20Models_Marco/Mensbrugghe%20(2005)%20LinkageTechnical%20Reference%20Doc.pdf,0,0,0

It disaggregates land use by agro-ecological zone (AEZ). To do so. it draws upon global land cover data bases. as well as state-of-the-art definition of AEZs from the FAO and IIASA. Agro-ecological zoning segments a parcel of land into smaller units according to agro-ecological characteristics. including: precipitation. temperature. soil type. terrain conditions. etc. Each zone has a similar combination of constraints and potential for land use. In the GTAP-AEZ Data Base. there are 18 AEZs. covering six different lengths of growing period spread over three different climatic zones. Land using activities include crop production. livestock raising. and forestry. In so doing. this extension of the standard GTAP Data Base permits a much more refined characterization of the potential for shifting land use amongst these different activities. When combined with information on greenhouse gas emissions. this data base permits economists interested in integrated assessment of climate change to better assess the role of land use change in greenhouse gases mitigation strategies.,True,EcuvSvIAAAAJ:foquWX3nUaYC,123,http://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/res_display.asp?RecordID=1900,2938393037292860017,/scholar?cites=2938393037292860017,,https://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/resources/download/4437.zip,0,0,0

In particular. we study how tradeoffs between growth and environmental objectives can be minimized by using targeted policies on pollution emissions in coordination with outward-oriented trade strategies. Most economy-wide studies of trade and environment linkages rely on effluent intensities associated with out-put and do not allow for substitution between nonpolluting factors (labor and capital) and polluting intermediate consumption such as chemicals or energy (Lee and Roland-Holst).

Expanded trading opportunities in natural resources and hazardous products and the associated development of potential pollution havens have added to fears about the environment. At the same time. pressures have mounted to use trade instruments to environmental ends. Recent agreements. such as NAFTA and the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). have incorporated environmental concerns and illustrate the intensity of the debate on trade and environment.’In addition. the emphasis now given to the concept of sustainable development. combined with more universal interest in outward-oriented development strategies. has linked the issue of longer-term growth with trade and the environment. The existing literature tends to follow the two directions of interaction. from trade policies to the environment. and from environment policies to trade flows.* This paper examines the trade and environment nexus in a rather different way. It looks first at the link between trade and environmental policy instruments (Part I). It then reviews the interaction between environmental regulation and competitiveness (Part 11). The linkages between trade liberalisation. growth and the environment are then considered in the context of the debate on sustainable development (Part 111).

Envisage is a global recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model developed originally at the World Bank. This current version reflects a complete re-coding of the model—initially done and supported by the Environment Directorate of the OECD.[Note that the model is still under development and does not yet contain all of the features of the original Envisage model.] Envisage has been developed to assess the interactions between economies and the global environment as affected by human-based emissions of greenhouse gases. At its core. Envisage is a relatively standard recursive dynamic multi-sector multi-region CGE model. It has been complemented by an emissions and climate module [tbd] that links directly economic activities to changes in global mean temperature. And it incorporates a feedback loop that links changes in temperature to impacts on economic variables such as agricultural yields or damages created by sea level rise [tbd]. One of the overall objectives of the development of Envisage has been to provide a greater focus on the economics of climate change for a more detailed set of developing countries as well as greater attention to the potential economic damages.

We use an economic model of global land use to investigate. from 2010 to 2030. the global agricultural outcomes. land use changes. and GHG abatement resulting from two potential Brazilian policies: a tax on cattle from conventional pasture and a subsidy for cattle from semi-intensive pasture. We find that under either policy. Brazil could achieve considerable sparing of forests and abatement of GHGs. in line with its national policy targets. The land spared. particularly under the tax. is far less than proportional to the productivity increased.

While the mainstream growth literature has not found military expenditure to be a significant determinant of growth. much of the defence economics literature has found significant effects. The paper argues that this is largely the product of the particular specification. the Feder–Ram model. that has been used in the defence economics literature but not in the mainstream literature.

We recognise the specificity of the exports between the emerging East Asian and industrialised countries and employ a generalised gravity model. In the empirical analysis we use a panel comprising 25 years of quarterly data and perform unit‐root and cointegration tests to verify the long‐run relationship among the variables. The results provide strong evidence that exchange rate volatility has a negative impact on the exports of emerging East Asian countries. In addition. the results suggest that the pattern of bilateral exports is influenced by third‐country variables.

China was given 5 years to completely open up its banking market for international competition. Chinese banks have been renowned for their mounting nonperforming loans and low efficiency. Despite gradual reforms. the banking system is still dominated by state ownership and encapsulated monopolistic control. How to raise efficiency is a key to the survival and success of domestic banks. especially the state-owned commercial banks. Two important factors may be responsible for raising efficiency: ownership reform and hard budget constraints. This article uses a panel data of 22 banks over the period 1995 to 2001. and employs a stochastic frontier production function to investigate the effects of ownership structure and hard budget constraint on efficiency.

Recent econometric studies suggest a Renminbi undervaluation on the order of 10 to 30%.

Within China there are widespread concerns regarding the adverse employment effects of a major revaluation on labour-intensive export sectors. yet the likely magnitude of these effects remains a controversial issue.

France. December 2015. the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide a special report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways. In Nairobi. Kenya. April 2016. the IPCC panel accepted the invitation.

We provide a simple and transparent method to create scenarios for future plant-based and animal-based calorie demand. using time-dependent regression models between calorie demand and income. The scenarios can be customized to a specific storyline by using different input data for gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections and by assuming different functional forms of the regressions. Our results confirm that total calorie demand increases with income. but we also found a non-income related positive time-trend. The share of animal-based calories is estimated to rise strongly with income for low-income groups. For high income groups. two ambiguous relations between income and the share of animal-based products are consistent with historical data: First. a positive relation with a strong negative time-trend and second a negative relation with a slight negative time-trend. The fits of our regressions are highly significant and our results compare well to other food demand estimates. The method is exemplarily used to construct four food demand scenarios until the year 2100 based on the storylines of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES).

We provide a simple and transparent method to create scenarios for future plant-based and animal-based calorie demand. using time-dependent regression models between calorie demand and income. The scenarios can be customized to a specific storyline by using different input data for gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections and by assuming different functional forms of the regressions. Our results confirm that total calorie demand increases with income. but we also found a non-income related positive time-trend. The share of animal-based calories is estimated to rise strongly with income for low-income groups. For high income groups. two ambiguous relations between income and the share of animal-based products are consistent with historical data: First. a positive relation with a strong negative time-trend and second a negative relation with a slight negative time-trend. The fits of our regressions are highly significant and our results compare well to other food demand estimates. The method is exemplarily used to construct four food demand scenarios until the year 2100 based on the storylines of the IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). We find in all scenarios a strong increase of global food demand until 2050 with an increasing share of animal-based products. especially in developing countries.,True,V7x2xEQAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,144,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139201,1588310882262128091,/scholar?cites=1588310882262128091,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139201,0,0,0

To assess their true economic implementation potential. major mitigation strategies are simultaneously examined with a U.S. agricultural sector model over a large range of hypothetical carbon prices. Soil carbon sequestration through reduced tillage appears most attractive for relatively low carbon prices. Afforestation and biofuel generation. however. dominate at higher price levels. For politically feasible prices. the competitive economic contribution of all major strategies is greatly below their technical potential.

Here we introduce the SRDB database. a near-universal compendium of published RS data. and make it available to the scientific community both as a traditional static archive and as a dynamic community database that may be updated over time by interested users. The database encompasses all published studies that report one of the following data measured in the field (not laboratory): annual RS. mean seasonal RS. a seasonal or annual partitioning of RS into its sources fluxes. RS temperature response (Q10). or RS at 10 °C. Its orientation is thus to seasonal and annual fluxes. not shorter-term or chamber-specific measurements. To date. data from 818 studies have been entered into the database. constituting 3379 records. The data span the measurement years 1961–2007 and are dominated by temperate. well-drained forests. We briefly examine some aspects of the SRDB data – its climate space coverage. mean annual RS fluxes and their correlation with other carbon fluxes. RS variability. temperature sensitivities. and the partitioning of RS source flux – and suggest some potential lines of research that could be explored using these data. The SRDB database is available online in a permanent archive as well as via a project-hosting repository; the latter source leverages open-source software technologies to encourage wider participation in the database's future development.

The impact of these short-term phenomena on larger scale ecosystem fluxes is increasingly recognized. and a growing number of studies show that these events affect fluxes of soil gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). methane (CH4). nitrous oxide (N2O). ammonia (NH3) and nitric oxide (NO). Global climate models predict that future climatic change is likely to alter the frequency and intensity of drying-rewetting events and thawing of frozen soils. These future scenarios highlight the importance of understanding how rewetting and thawing will influence dynamics of these soil gases. This study summarizes findings using a new database containing 338 studies conducted from 1956 to 2011. and highlights open research questions. The database revealed conflicting results following rewetting and thawing in various terrestrial ecosystems and among soil gases. ranging from large increases in fluxes to non-significant changes. Studies reporting lower gas fluxes before rewetting tended to find higher post-rewetting fluxes for CO2. N2O and NO; in addition. increases in N2O flux following thawing were greater in warmer climate regions. We discuss possible mechanisms and controls that regulate flux responses. and recommend that a high temporal resolution of flux measurements is critical to capture rapid changes in gas fluxes after these soil perturbations.

The economy-wide losses are small with energy. agriculture. chemicals. high tech manufacturing and trade being most affected. The availability of lower cost offsets substantially reduces these economic losses. The economy becomes less capital but more labor intensive. Household welfare losses are smaller for full consumption (goods. services and leisure). A more inelastic trade-off between consumption and leisure dramatically reduces policy costs as do more favorable revenue recycling options. Induced technical change yields a small. measurable reduction in policy costs.,True,YemblGIAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,31,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988309001157,9722558138027111270,/scholar?cites=9722558138027111270,,,0,0,0

Models from seven teams participated in this part of the study assessing economy-wide cap-and-trade climate policy and sectoral policies in the transportation and electric sector in terms of potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions. economic cost. and energy systems implications. This paper presents an overview of the results from the US policy scenarios. and provides insights into the comparison of results from the participating models. In particular. various metrics were used to compare the model results including allowance price. the efficient frontier. consumption loss. GDP loss. and equivalent variation. We find that the choice of economic metric is an important factor in the comparison of model results. Among the insights. we note that the carbon price should cautiously be considered when other non-cap sectoral policies affecting emissions are assumed in tandem. We also find that a transportation sector policy is consistently shown to be inefficient compared to an economy-wide capand-trade policy with a comparable level of emissions reductions.

Development of the SGM is an ongoing process. and changes to the structure described in this document are anticipated. The structure of the model described in this document is current as of October 2005.The SGM was constructed to address the climate problem in general. but more specifically to allow for analysis of alternative climate policies over a time period of five to fifty years. Our focus on climate has influenced model design in many ways including the need for global coverage. selection of a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. realistic representation of energy technologies. and capturing important energy system dynamics through capital stock turnover. While this document covers the theoretical structure of the SGM. a companion document (Sands and Fawcett. 2005) covers the current data requirements and parameterization of the SGM. The model is scaled to represent aggregate behavior of nations and regional aggregations of nations. The model is a recursive dynamic model that solves in five year time steps. It is currently run forward 50 years into the future. The model is therefore appropriate for addressing questions associated with energy-economy-climate policy interactions for economies over a medium-term time horizon.

Economic Research Service,Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases can be reduced by withdrawing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in soils and biomass. This report analyzes the performance of alternative incentive designs and payment levels if farmers were paid to adopt land uses and management practices that raise soil carbon levels. At payment levels below $10 per metric ton for permanently sequestered carbon. analysis suggests landowners would find it more cost effective to adopt changes in rotations and tillage practices. At higher payment levels. afforestation dominates sequestration activities. mostly through conversion of pastureland. Across payment levels. the economic potential to sequester carbon is much lower than the technical potential reported in soil science studies. The most cost-effective payment design adjusts payment levels to account both for the length of time farmers are willing to commit to sequestration activities and for net sequestration.

A focus on benefits. to the exclusion of costs. in standard-setting and enforcement leads to inefficiencies. We show that. even when the legislature cannot peg the budget to a specific enforcement policy. it can reduce the distortions by limiting the enforcement agency's budget and by permitting the agency to partially self-finance from rebates of noncompliance fines.,True,Uu_VP-cAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,70,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009506969090060C,3854734788109728575,/scholar?cites=3854734788109728575,,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/28481/0000275.pdf;sequence=1,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,Many regulatory agencies enforcing quality standards across diverse populations of firms lack sufficient resources to promote full compliance. Based on a model with lump‐sum noncompliance penalties. W. Kip Viscusi and Richard J. Zeckhauser have advocated that. in most circumstances. an agency with insufficient enforcement resources should choose a less stringent standard than it would choose if it could induce full compliance. I show that the recommendation for regulatory restraint depends upon the shape of the penalty function. A review of inspection and penalty policies suggests that U.S. administrative law encompasses a diversity of variable expected penalty policies.

The basic analytical results are quite intuitive: welfare calculations with a site-choice travel cost model that omits relevant substitute activities will tend to understate gains and to overstate losses for a fixed sample and a fixed set of model parameters. The magnitude of bias in any particular case will be directly related to the degree of substitution between the omitted activities and the activities included in the model. In our empirical application. we examine changes in the quality of trout and salmon fishing on the Great Lakes and on anadromous runs.

The major study sponsor. the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR). funded the research to produce a model that could be used to improve fisheries resource management and to perform natural resource damage assessments. One out of every two households in Michigan has a fishing license. suggesting that fishing-related benefits will represent a substantial portion of the total benefits of improvements in water and sediment quality.The travel cost model was designed to value recreational expenences. In a recent state-of-the-art review of recreation models. Bockstael: McConnell and Strand (1991) conclude that the random utility version of the travel cost model is particularly wellsuited to valuing changes in quality at one or more recreation sites. The random utility model allows the researcher to model a wide range of substitution possibilities and. consequently. provides a procedure for estimating the value of changes in environmental quality.

Relative to small farms. these farms achieve greater economies of scale. generate higher profit margins. and their households realize a larger share of their income from farming.

Model results show that for a percentage change in population. global production and consumption of major field crops respond at nearly the same rate. In response to a change in per capita income. the percentage change in crop consumption is much lower. about one-third the percentage change in income.

Research published in the American Journal of Public Health found that a gap opened between metro and nonmetro mortality rates about 1990. Mortality rates are a key indicator of health status when they are adjusted for age (since mortality increases with age beyond early childhood). Age-adjusted mortality rates of both metro and nonmetro counties declined about 1.5 percent per year from 1968 through 1989. However. the nonmetro decline in age-adjusted mortality slowed markedly compared with the metro trend beginning in 1990. As a result. the average annual difference in mortality rates between nonmetro and metro areas increased from approximately 6 additional deaths per 100.000 population in nonmetro areas in 1989 to 82 more deaths per 100.000 population in 2005. Nonmetro counties can be further segmented into micropolitan (micro) counties—larger counties that include urban clusters with between 10.000 and 50.000 people—and the more remote. less densely populated noncore counties—those not part of an urban cluster of at least 10.000 people. Nationally. the mortality rate increases as the level of urbanization declines. with metro counties having the lowest mortality rate and noncore counties having the highest rate.

The larger the impact of domestic biofuels feedstock production on commodity prices and the availability of exports. the larger the international land-use effects are likely to be. The amount of pressure placed on land internationally will depend in part on how much of the land needed for biofuel production is met through an expansion of agricultural land in the US If crop yield per acre increases through more intensive management or new crop varieties. then less land is needed to grow a particular amount of that crop.

1189651,Economic valuation of resource injuries in natural resource liability suits,2000,Carol Adaire Jones,126,Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management,6,358-365,American Society of Civil Engineers,Several major federal environmental statutes enacted in the 1970s designate federal. state. and tribal resource management agencies as trustees of natural resources on behalf of the public and enable the trustees to recover damages for injuries to public resources. The measure of damages in the statutes is the cost of restoring the resources to baseline conditions. plus the interim loss in value from the time of the incident until full recovery of the resources. The statutory restriction limiting use of the monies to enhancing or creating natural resources motivated the development of an alternative measure for interim losses—the cost of compensatory restoration actions providing in-kind compensation. In this paper alternative measures of damages are outlined and approaches and methods for scaling compensatory restoration are discussed.

Sequestration may not last forever and may either be released in the future or require expenditures to maintain the practices that keep it sequestered. In this paper. we investigate the differential value of offsets in the face of impermanent characteristics by forming a price discount that equalizes the effective price per ton between a “perfect offset” and one possessing some with impermanent characteristics. We find this discount to be a function of the future needs to replace offsets (in the face of lease expiration quantity or volatilization upon activities such as timber harvest) and the magnitude of any needed maintenance costs. We investigate the magnitude of the discounts under alternative agricultural tillage and forest management cases.

The results reveal that average rice yield is positively related to temperature and negatively associated with precipitation. Both temperature and precipitation. which are risk-increasing inputs. are positively related to rice yield variability. The widened yield variability can be transferred to the fluctuation of rice production and rice price instability. Larger market risk is expected in the future since both temperature and precipitation are anticipated to increase. An evaluation of climate change impact on rice yield variability reveals that it may increase by up to 10%~ 20%.

We selected China and a base-year of 1997 for this comparison. This year is convenient because it is the base year for GTAP version 5.4. and an input-output table is available for China (with 124 producing sectors) in that year.

Coal to gas switching has been triggered by the recent shale gas revolution. which the entire U.S. has experienced. not the RGGI region alone.

To estimate the effects of RGGI implementation in terms of the fuel switching. we use the synthetic control method for comparative case studies.

1189665,Economic investigation of discount factors for agricultural greenhouse gas emission offsets,2005,Man-Keun Kim,,,,,,This dissertation analyzes the basis for and magnitudes of discount factors based on the characteristics of greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) offsets that are applied to the GHGE reduction projects. concentrating on agricultural projects.  Theoretical approaches to discount factors. estimation and incorporation of discount factors procedures are developed.  Discount factors would be imposed by credit purchasers due to noncompliance with regulatory program of the credits with GHG program including consideration of shortfall penalties and limited durations.  Discount factors are proposed for (i) additionality. (ii) leakage. (iii) permanence. and (iv) uncertainty.  Additionality arise when the region where an AO project is being proposed would have substantial adoption of the AO practice in the absence of GHG programs (business as usual GHGE offset).  Leakage arises when the effect of a program is offset by an induced increase in economic activity and accompanying emissions elsewhere.  The leakage effect depends on demand and supply elasticities.  Permanence reflects the saturation and volatility characteristics of carbon sequestration.  Carbon is stored in a volatile form and can be released quickly to the atmosphere when an AO practice is discontinued.  The permanence discount depends on the project design including practice continuation after the program and the dynamic rate of offset.  Also. consideration of multiple offsets is important.  Uncertainty arises due to the stochastic nature of project quantity. The uncertainty discount tends to be smaller the larger the size of the offset contract due to aggregation over space and time.

The PP provision is defined as the “failure to plant an insured crop by the final planting date due to adverse events.” If the farmer decides not to plant a crop. the farmer receives a PP indemnity. Late planting (LP) is an option for farmers to plant a crop while maintaining crop insurance after the final planting date. Crop insurance may alter farmers’ behavior in selecting PP or LP and could increase the likelihood of PP claims even though farmers can choose LP. This study finds evidence that a farmer with higher insurance coverage tends to choose PP more often (ex‐post moral hazard).

The number of culled animals was up to 3.5 million heads and more than 90% of the culled animals were swine. KREI (2011) estimates the direct supply reduction in the swine sector to be 32% of the total value of the production. while the direct supply reductions in dairy cattle and beef cattle sectors to be 8.4% and 3.9%. respectively (KREI. 2011. p. 283). KREI (2011) also estimates the direct and indirect economic impact from the supply reduction to be more than 4 trillion Korean Won (» USD 3.6 billion) using the Input-Output (IO) analysis (KREI. 2011. p. 283). The value added falls by 0.96 trillion Korean Won (» USD 0.86 billion)(KREI. 2011. p. 283). The number of employment is reduced by 47.813 persons (KREI. 2011. p. 283).

However. it isn’t flexible to investigate the regional impact from the capacity limitations which are directly imposed on production. not final demand. This is because the multipliers are changing with exogenous restrictions on production. Conventionally. the IO analysis is performed assuming exogenous production restrictions being the changes in final demands or assuming the sector being exogenous sector like the final demand. If researchers or policy makers are interested in only economic impacts from production restrictions. there is no need to look into the modified multipliers. The modified multipliers should be considered when researchers and policy makers attempt to analyze the compensation of impact. especially recovery of loss using government expenditure. We suggest that the linear programming is a useful and efficient tool to derive modified multipliers and estimate correct regional impact from the policy changes.,True,WMIJ7tQAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,4,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/46716/,892148468171606031,/scholar?cites=892148468171606031,,https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/46716/files/IO_LP_Multipliers_SAEA2009.pdf,0,0,0

1189676,How much would carbon cost a buyer?,2004,Bruce A McCarl and Tanveer A Butt and Man-Keun Kim,,"Unpublished manuscript, Texas A&M University",,,,As society endeavors to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions it becomes important to find low cost emission offsets (EO). Agriculture and forestry can potentially provide a number of options for creating EOs (McCarl and Schneider. 2000. 2001). These options include the oft-discussed carbon sequestration from afforestation or agricultural tillage changes as well as a number of other options (IPCC. 2001). The widely contemplated implementation of the strategy for emission reduction involves forms of cap and trade systems involving tradable emission permits (see the discussion in the Kyoto Protocol. United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). The attractiveness of an option to an offset buyer depends upon it's relative cost in comparison with options from a variety of other sources. Nearly 80% of GHG emissions today come from electricity generation and forms of petroleum based fuel consumption (EPA. 2003). The incidence of emission cutbacks is likely to fall on such energy sector industries. In turn. firms in the energy industries are likely to seek to buy emission permits from across the economy. not just from agriculture and forestry. As such agricultural and forestry carbon costs need to be compared with such diverse activities as carbon removed from the atmosphere by flu gas capture operations; carbon avoided by electricity generation when there is fuel switching to biofuels. natural gas. or nuclear power as opposed to coal or petroleum-based generation; along with many other options (see the discussion of options in IPCC. 2001).

Using the synthetic control method. we find the campaign to have contributed to rapid visitation growth at Arches. Canyonlands. and Capitol Reef NPs. No ad campaign effect was found for Bryce Canyon and Zion NPs. which implies that recent increased visitation at these parks has been driven by the national trends and not the Mighty 5 promotion. Arches.

The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program #5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5).

Simulation results are compared to reference data at global. national and grid cell scales and we evaluate model performance with respect to time series correlation. spatial correlation and mean bias. We find that global gridded crop models (GGCMs) show mixed skill in reproducing time series correlations or spatial patterns at the different spatial scales.

Yield variability can be well reproduced for most major producing countries by many GGCMs and for all countries by at least some.

However. model simulations of future climate-impacts on crop yields differ substantially in the magnitude and even direction of the projected change. Combining observations of current maximum-attainable yield with climate analogues. we provide a complementary method of assessing the effect of climate change on crop yields. Strong reductions in attainable yields of major cereal crops are found across a large fraction of current cropland by 2050. These areas are vulnerable to climate change and have greatly reduced opportunity for agricultural intensification. However. the total land area. including regions not currently used for crops. climatically suitable for high attainable yields of maize. wheat and rice is similar by 2050 to the present-day.

In comparison with dry targets. the liquid is found to significantly affect ablation by confining the solid and slowing down the expansion of the laser-heated material. These factors affect the relative efficiency of the various ablation mechanisms. leading. in particular. to the complete inhibition of phase explosion at lower fluences. a reduced ablation yield. and significant changes in the composition of the plume. As a consequence. at fluences above the ablation threshold. the size of the ejected nanoclusters is lower in presence of the liquid.

Actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate future climate changes. are thus of central importance for agricultural production. Climate impacts are. however. not unidirectional; some crops in some regions (primarily higher latitudes) are projected to benefit. particularly if increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is assumed to strongly increase crop productivity at large spatial and temporal scales. Climate mitigation measures that are implemented by reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations lead to reductions both in the strength of climate change and in the benefits of carbon dioxide fertilization. Consequently. analysis of the effects of climate mitigation on agricultural productivity must address not only regions for which mitigation is likely to reduce or even reverse climate damages …,True,MVf0XGEAAAAJ:PR6Y55bgFSsC,52,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/125004/meta,12300335767093717341,/scholar?cites=12300335767093717341,,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/125004/pdf,0,0,0

Consequences of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions on agricultural productivity have direct and immediate relevance for human societies. Future crop yields will be affected by anthropogenic climate change as well as direct effects of emissions such as CO 2 fertilization.

The efficiency of this process lies in the local and continuous delivery of a wide range of growth factors and proteins. mimicking the needs of the physiological wound healing and reparative tissue processes. Consequently. the application of platelet-rich plasma has been extended to many different fields. including orthopedics. sports medicine. dentistry. cosmetic and periodontal medicine and cosmetic. plastic and maxillofacial surgery.

Recently developed biomaterials can enable and augment the targeted delivery of drugs or therapeutic proteins to the brain. allow cell or tissue transplants to be effectively delivered to the brain and help to rebuild damaged circuits. Similarly. biomaterials are being used to promote regeneration and to repair damaged neuronal pathways in combination with stem cell therapies. Many of these approaches are gaining momentum because nanotechnology allows greater control over material–cell interactions that induce specific developmental processes and cellular responses including differentiation. migration and outgrowth.,True,B6b8TB0AAAAJ:PELIpwtuRlgC,415,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn2685,14845149959096558363,/scholar?cites=14845149959096558363,,,0,0,0
