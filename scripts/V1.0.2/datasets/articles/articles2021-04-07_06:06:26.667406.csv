1331181,A review of process intensification applied to solids handling,2017,Haoyu Wang and Ahmad Mustaffar and Anh N Phan and Vladimir Zivkovic and David Reay and Richard Law and Kamelia Boodhoo,118,,,78-107,Elsevier,Process intensification (PI) is a strategy aimed at transforming conventional chemical processes into more economical. productive and green processes. Its fundamental concept hinges upon the volume reduction of processing equipment resulting in enhanced mixing and heat/mass transfer as well as a multitude of other benefits. To date. the focus of PI has been on processes mainly involving gas/liquid systems. Solids handling applications have been more limited as fouling and blockages can occur due to large concentrations of solids in smaller equipment sizes. Appropriately designed equipment is therefore a key consideration for intensifying industrially-relevant solids handling processes.In this review paper. we highlight a number of solid processing applications including precipitation. separation. granulation and milling. etc. where PI has been demonstrated. Much effort has been directed at reactive …,True,gkPdF2kAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,71,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270116306742,1320063066429599800,/scholar?cites=1320063066429599800,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270116306742,0,0,0

In this work. it is proposed to use expanded metal mesh (EMM) as an inexpensive alternative. Raised aluminium EMM sheet was cut into five layers. arranged perpendicularly and attached with wire columns. creating a 90% porosity unit. Salt hydrate PCM. which melted at 46 °C. filled the void space creating a PCM/EMM composite. The composite was heated at 55 °C. and the melt completion time was compared with the control i.e. pure PCM. It was found that EMM reduced the melting time by 14%. which could be increased if better thermal interfaces such as soldering or brazing were used. Small scale modelling compared very well with the experimental results. which verified its viability to model PCM/EMM systems.

This heat sink would also be applicable to accommodate power surges or thermal buffering-related conditions. The melting point of the salt hydrate PCM was 46 °C. The coolant water was heated up to 60 °C. similar to the inlet condition in traction liquid cooling systems. The vacuum impregnation method used to create the composite resulted in a 96% impregnation ratio.

1331190,Irregular aluminium foam and phase change material composite in transient thermal management,2016,Ahmad Fadhlan Bin Mustaffar,,,,,,Traction systems generate high loads of waste heat. which need to be removed for efficient operations. A new transient heat sink is proposed. which is based on salt hydrate phase change material (PCM). The heat sink would absorb heat during the short stationary phase i.e. at stations in which the PCM melts. a process accelerated by aluminium foam as it increases the rate of heat transfer within the PCM. When the train moves. the PCM is solidified via a forced convection stack. This creates a passive and efficient thermal solution. especially once heat pipe is employed as heat conduit. At the outset. the characteristics of the foam needed to be accurately determined. The foam was uncommon as its pore morphology was irregular. therefore it was scanned in a medical computed tomography (CT) scanner. which allowed for the construction of a three dimensional (3D) model. The model accuracy was enhanced by software. resulting in an extremely useful analytical tool. The model enabled important structural parameters to be measured e.g. porosity and specific surface area. which were crucial for the subsequent thermal and fluid flow analyses. A defect dense region was also detected. the effect of which was further investigated. Interestingly in the volume devoid of this defect. the porosity and specific surface area were uniform. A test rig was constructed that mimicked liquid cooling (or in the planned application. heat pipe cooling) in power electronics. At the core was a heat sink of salt hydrate PCM. impregnated within the foam. The sink with its current specifications (with liquid cooling) was able to absorb a thermal load consistent from a group of …,True,gkPdF2kAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,http://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/handle/10443/3338,5063325648573041966,/scholar?cites=5063325648573041966,,,https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/bitstream/10443/3338/1/Mustaffar%2C%20A.F.B.%202016.pdf,0,0,0

In this regard. methane hydrate equilibrium conditions have been typically determined using different heating paths – continuous and stepwise. The step-heating path. with proper size and duration of temperature increment. provided the most accurate data of methane hydrate phase equilibrium conditions compared with other experimental data available in literature. We have concluded that equilibrium step-heating path had the potential for determining reliable hydrate phase diagrams. irrespective of the present components in the system.

Taguchi experimental design was used in a completely randomized design with two replications for trans esterification reaction and investigating the effect of reaction time. temperature and catalyst amount on the biodiesel production efficiency and optimize the number of experiments. Also Molar ratio (alcohol: oil) 15 to 1. catalyst amount 0.5. 1. 1.5. 2. 3 and 5 wt.%. reaction temperature of 55. 65 and 75 °C. reaction time of 0.5. 1. 1.5. 2. 2.5 and 3 hr. and stirring rate of 600 rpm was used for trans esterification reaction. Biodiesel yield (99%) was obtained by trans esterification process at 65 °C using 2 wt. % of K2CO3/Al2O3 in 2 hr. Other researcher’s results comparison shows that the loading ratio of K2CO3 compared to KNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 can increase the biodiesel production efficiency in alumina base catalysts. Analysis of variance analysis with regard to catalyst. reaction time and temperature variables indicates that temperature changes have no significant effect on the efficiency of methyl ester. but the effect of time and amount of catalyst variations used on the conversion rate of the reaction is quite significant.,True,0yHW2J4AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,3,http://www.jfnc.ir/article_53995.html?lang=en,1299150917461518919,/scholar?cites=1299150917461518919,,,http://www.jfnc.ir/article_53995_25e11fc043371ea59d42c6f782403558.pdf,0,0,0

In democracies. maintaining energy policy on politically salient and controversial issues. such as the use of fracking. depends on popular support at local if not national levels. We therefore study the effectiveness of widely cited arguments about fracking in a representative sample of the United States. Consistent with framing theory. we find that arguments that emphasize the environmental costs of fracking drive down support. while arguments emphasizing job creation and energy security increase it. However. we also show that presenting competing information from pro-fracking and anti-fracking frames together neutralizes individual framing effects. albeit not for every combination of frames and counter-frames.

Climate change. tropical deforestation. biodiversity loss. ozone depletion. hazardous wastes. and ocean pollution are among several issues that have brought national governments together in common purpose. As they have worked to mitigate these global problems. governments have developed a wide variety of environmental regime designs. Some global environmental regimes are more institutionally integrated than others. Some regimes impose legally binding obligations on countries while others involve non-binding commitments. And some regimes involve global standards and rules while others leave national commitments up to countries' discretion. What explains the pattern of regime design in global environmental governance? Alexander Ovodenko demonstrates that national governments have developed different institutional responses to global issues because the markets producing environmental pollution impose varying constraints and create varying opportunities for governments. Contrary to the prevailing literature. governments are more inclined to impose stringent rules and regulations on oligopolistic industries than on competitive ones. The capital resources and innovation potential of oligopolistic businesses make them more cost-effective and economical in reducing pollution and meeting global standards than businesses in competitive industries.

Considering that competitive producers face greater barriers to political collective action. what explains the form of global governance across these sectors? This article demonstrates that oligopolistic producers are more intensively and extensively regulated than competitive markets because producers in oligopolistic industries can more cost-effectively alter markets to meet environmental goals.

Under what conditions do they form environmental cooperation consisting of un-integrated rules and institutions? I argue that governments form integrated cooperation when they share convergent preferences over cooperation. They form unintegrated cooperation when they have divergent preferences. Preferences diverge under one of two conditions:(i) economic actors (“stakeholders”) responsible for the environmental problem operate in diffuse markets. or (ii) states have an asymmetrically interdependent relationship in managing the environmental issue. When neither condition holds. governments share convergent preferences over environmental cooperation. I evaluate the importance of stakeholder concentrations by studying patterns of cooperation on global environmental issues such as climate change. ozone layer depletion. biodiversity loss. and mercury pollution. I evaluate the importance of interdependence structures by studying patterns of cooperation on regional rivers. lakes. and seas. The analysis employs original data stemming from agreement texts. field surveys. primary-source interviews. field observations. primary texts. quantitative data. as well as secondary sources.

Philadelphia,,,,Under what conditions do governments depart from international environmental agreements and make new agreements at alternative forums? In this paper. I provide an explanation for what I call “institutional departure.” under which parties depart from existing international environmental agreements in pursuit of greater cooperation on the issues for which those agreements were negotiated. The argument emphasizes negative externalities and the participation of critical parties in environmental agreements. The empirical analysis draws upon a new dataset of international environmental agreements with an original measure of institutional departure. as well as an in-depth process-tracing analysis of international climate change governance. The findings indicate that nonparticipation by critical parties is positively associated with an increased probability of institutional departure. However. it is not systematically associated with follow-up agreements such as protocols or amendments to the agreement subject to departure.

The most optimist forecasts reveal the fact that the main classic energy resources (oil and natural gas) will be exhausted until 2050. Also. the combustion causes the greenhouse effect which will determine an apocalyptical scenario in the next (80-100) years. In this scenario. the only solution is finding and using new energy resources. inexhaustible and clean. which will substitute in the next 50 years the current resources based on fossil fuels.The growing share of renewable energy production is predictable but depends both on reducing the production costs and on finding new electrical energy storage solutions. This will ensure the injection into the power system of large quantities of renewable energy. Even more. the legislation regarding environment protection imposes the usage of this kind of energy.

Most often this compensation could be made also for network load balancing. which will also have a positive effect on voltage quality. For this. a shunt unbalance capacitive compensation is necessary. The compensation is obtained using a delta compensator load sized depending on the load structure. This connection allows a redistribution of active power and reactive power between the phases of the network so that the ensemble load-compensator is perfectly balanced and has the desired power factor.

1331281,Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Simulation of the Dynamic Behaviour of Thermal and Hydro Power Plants,2011,Flavius Dan Surianu,,,,,IntechOpen,The global economic and social development process has brought about increasing capacities of electric energy production. transportation and distribution. This fact has required both the development of the national power systems and the interconnection of most of them. leading to real expanded continental power systems. But technological development and territorial expansion have generated new problems concerning their running and monitoring. Planning. designing. leading and running such huge systems has turned to very complex activities. indissolubly linked with their operating stability. The problem of power system stability has got new spatial and temporal dimensions implying the reconsideration of the means and methods of analysis through revising and expanding mathematical modelling in order to get a most accurate numerical simulation of the operating regime1. The operating experience shows that the synchronism of synchronous generators in networking power plants can be lost even at a few minutes after a disturbance has appeared. In this case the phenomena are much more complex and they refer to slow power oscillations on the interconnecting electric lines among large areas which lead to a decrease in frequency and loss of synchronism among these regions. Such phenomena can appear due to the poor performance of the frequency-exchange power control and the unsatisfactory answer of the slow action of the governing elements as. for example. those of the boilers. turbines. charging valves. feeding pumps. hydro units etc. In this respect. they speak about Long Term Dynamic (LTD) stability or slow phenomena …,True,hZsL_1QAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Flavius_Dan_Surianu/publication/221917357_Mathematical_Modelling_and_Numerical_Simulation_of_the_Dynamic_Behaviour_of_Thermal_and_Hydro_Power_Plants/links/0f31753396608cc426000000.pdf,16513425993210876233,/scholar?cites=16513425993210876233,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Flavius_Dan_Surianu/publication/221917357_Mathematical_Modelling_and_Numerical_Simulation_of_the_Dynamic_Behaviour_of_Thermal_and_Hydro_Power_Plants/links/0f31753396608cc426000000.pdf,0,0,0

Ethiopia has been trying to emulate such a trend in its own economy. Under a public monopoly. the information and communication technology (ICT) sector in Ethiopia has seen substantial growth over the last five years.

It is a fact that rainfall-runoff modeling and the other data-driven techniques are significant events in this cycle. Especially. estimation of missing the streamflow is an important process for designing and planning flood protection studies in the datadriven techniques. Drought is thought one of harmful natural phenomenon in terms of hydrology. Drought estimation methods should be investigated in detail. Furthermore. observational data in hydrological works have many errors due to gauging. These obtained data should be evaluated for applicability in some hydrological calculations. Therefore. this paper aims to research use of datadriven techniques in hydrology.In the literature there are several studies that use ANN and data mining methods for hydrological studies such as rainfall-runoff modeling and drought analysis. The ANN methods is one of the most commonly used in rainfall-runoff relation modeling (Dawson & Wilby 1999. Alp & Cigizoglu 2005. Nourani et al. 2009. Machado et al. 2011. Gumus et al. 2013.

1331325,Modeling flood shock wave propagation with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method: An experimental comparison study,2019,E Turhan and H Ozmen-Cagatay and A Tantekin,,,,,APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH/CORVINUS UNIV BUDAPEST,The applicability of experimental and numerical models used for the solution of dam-break flows is vital for better dam projects and also in preventing related accidents. The high cost and the timeconsuming nature of laboratory studies require consistency in the investigation of numerical models. In this study. the propagation of a flow using a fluid with a different density from that of normal water in the reservoir was investigated both experimentally and numerically. Salt water was preferred as a Newtonian fluid in order to observe the propagation of flows in different density after a sudden break. A small-scale channel was constructed and laboratory data were obtained using image processing techniques. For the numerical model. Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations solved by Flow-3D software. were applied. Flow depth changes were observed in the reservoir and the downstream. The data obtained from all methods were compared with each other. The results of two numerical simulations point out that the disagreements on graphs in the time evolutions of the fluid levels in the SPH increase due to turbulence effects. whilst. these differences decrease in the RANS equations solved by Flow-3D software. Consequently. since the SPH provides taking the measures and developing intervention strategies to reduce the risks connected to the evolution of dam-break flows. it is thought that future validation studies of the model will be require with the use of data observed in this field.,True,M87beGUAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,2,http://aloki.hu/pdf/1702_30333047.pdf,9080359493865398741,/scholar?cites=9080359493865398741,,,http://aloki.hu/pdf/1702_30333047.pdf,0,0,0

Turkey. The equipment for the investigated plant can be aligned as a fluidized bed coal combustor (FBCC). a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). an economizer (ECO). fans. pumps. a cyclone and a chimney. Whole parts of equipment are investigated separately and energetic and exergetic inspections are enforced for whole parts of the plant. The maximum exergy destruction rates in the plant are obtained for the FBCC. HRSG and ECO with 95%. 3% and 1% of the whole system. respectively. Higher excess air in the system induces heat losses. especially in the FBCC component by virtue of the rising in mass flow rate of the flue gas. This situation can be considered as one of the primary reasons of irreversibility. Additionally. higher excess air induces the decrement of combustion efficiency in FBCC. Therefore. this value and adverse effects on combustion efficiency can be decreased by reducing the flow rate of air.,True,M87beGUAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,2,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/thermal/issue/31328/353690,552215168669167368,/scholar?cites=552215168669167368,,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/364738,0,0,0

Energy. which is one of the main factors as reflection of a country in terms of economic and social way of thinking. is the case of a limited resource. Therefore. improving energy efficiency and renewable energy sources are important issues to be focused on. Hydroelectric power. which is produced considering environmental and socioeconomic factors and a balanced plan. is regarded as clean and renewable energy source. Increasing global warming and climate change in recent years has revealed the need for energy storage because of negative effects on water resources. In this study. hydrological drought analysis was made using the average monthly flow of currents feeding the Hydroelectric Power Plants (HPP) in Adana. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method was used and drought classification was created with the help of SPI-Time curve and division of four periods of observed current. In most of the water years. extreme droughts and increment of the total drought values was observed and it can be expected to continue this increment in the following years. Therefore. the importance of Pumped Storage Hydroelectric Power Plants (PSHPP) have emerged when considering the situations that the peak flow of energy is insufficient and require energy storage.

1331339,Representing node-internal transmission and distribution grids in energy system models,2018,Denis Hess and Manuel Wetzel and Karl-Kiên Cao,119,Renewable Energy,,874-890,Pergamon,Today's energy system models calculate power flows between simplified nodes representing transmission and distribution grid of a region or a country – so called copper plates. Such nodes are often restricted to a few tens thus the grid is not well represented or totally neglected in the whole energy system analysis due to limited computational performance using such models. Here we introduce our new methodology of node-internal grid calculation representing the electricity grid in cost values based on strong correlations between peak load. grid cost and feed-in share of wind and photovoltaic capacity. We validate in our case study this approach using a 491 node model for Germany. This examination area is modelled as enclosed energy system to calculate the grid in a 100% renewable energy system in 2050 enabling maximum grid expansion. Our grid model facilitates grid expansion cost and reduces …,True,AfPCnu4AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,14,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148117310054,2498668630161830079,/scholar?cites=2498668630161830079,,,https://elib.dlr.de/115271/1/Postprint%20-%20Representing%20node-internal%20transmission%20and%20distribution%20grids%20in%20energy%20system%20models.pdf,0,0,0

1331347,The value of concentrating solar power for a sustainable electricity supply in Europe. Middle East and North Africa,2018,Denis Hess,,,,,,Dispatchable solar power from concentrating solar thermal power plants (CSP) combined with thermal energy storage and co-firing option can provide energy according to demand. A transfer of such electricity from solar thermal power plants in desert regions to distant consumer centres may therefore complement regional or domestic energies. The research question of the value of this transfer was already analysed in qualitative studies that found out a high potential of this idea. However. a detailed energy system modelling showing the value of concentrating solar power plants from Middle East and North Africa (MENA) for Europe (EU) was not yet done. This thesis closes the scientific knowledge gap applying an energy system model with a least-cost approach and detailed scenario analysis for the year 2050. The thesis describes the effects of including and excluding a transfer of CSP from MENA to EU. The transfer-system consists of a power plant and a high voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) and is therefore called CSP-HVDC (concentrating solar power - high voltage direct current) power plant. The techno-economic assumptions for this composed technology are strictly chosen to avoid its overestimation. The assessment of CSP-HVDC considers energy system evaluation criteria. These multi-criteria reveal the impact of CSP-HVDC on energy infrastructure. operational behaviour. cost and emission of the energy system. To evaluate national grid expansion. a new grid methodology is introduced as composed of transmission and distribution grid. This new model reduces complexity of the grid and analyses grid expansion considering …,True,AfPCnu4AAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,1,http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/9839,14669882541466819211,/scholar?cites=14669882541466819211,,,https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/bitstream/11682/9839/3/Dissertation%20Denis%20Hess.pdf,0,0,0

1331363,Hak pemeliharaan dan penangkapan ikan eksistensi dan prospek pengaturannya di Indonesia,2000,Sudirman Saad,,,,,,When the 1960 Basic Agrarian Law (UUPA) was being discussed in Parliament (DPR Gotong Royong). debates on the concept of common property applicable to aquatic resources were also taking place. In those days some experts had begun to notice a number of weaknesses in the concept of common property-one of which being its failure to release fishermen from the bondage of poverty--and they put forward the concept of sole ownership as an alternative. It is therefore reasonable to ascribe the concept of Fish breeding and Fishing Rights (HPPI)).as stipulated in article 47 of the U UPA. to the afore-mentioned debates. Furthermore. the characteristics of HPPI are similar to the concept of sole ownership. However. it is surprising that the politics of fishery law that developed later showed a tendency in the opposite direction. Against this background. this research is concerned with four research questions. First. what are the underlying factors in the inclusion of HPPI into the provisions of the LKPA; why is the ensuing politics of fishery law characterized by common property? Second. where does the existence of HPPI fit into in the context of uluyut rights? Third. how does udut law (in the Province of South Sulawesi) provide for fishing rights? Fourth. what are the prospects of the provision for HPPI in Indonesia? This research adopts two kinds of methodology. i.e. normative (documentary) research and sociologml (survey and field) research. The first is used for collecting documents and relevant research findings. the second for collecting primary data through in-depth interviews conducted in two villages in the Province of South Sulawesi. and the …,True,eI6B9owAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,10,https://repository.ugm.ac.id/171799/,480928501634883225,/scholar?cites=480928501634883225,,,,0,0,0

It has recently been shown to provide a precise implementation and meaning to the maximum entropy production principle and to encompass many well-established theories of nonequilibrium thermodynamics into a single unifying geometrical framework. Its original formulation in the framework of quantum thermodynamics (QT) assumes the simplest and most natural Fisher-Rao metric to geometrize from a dynamical standpoint the manifold of density operators. which represent the thermodynamic NE states of the system.

The framework called steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEA-QT) is based on the paradigm of intrinsic quantum thermodynamic (IQT). which is a theory that unifies quantum mechanics and thermodynamics into a single discipline with wide applications to the study of non-equilibrium phenomena at the atomistic level. SEA-QT is a novel approach for describing the state of chemically reactive systems as well as the kinetic and dynamic features of the reaction process without any assumptions of near-equilibrium states or weak-interactions with a reservoir or bath. Entropy generation is the basis of the dissipation which takes place internal to the system and is. thus. the driving force of the chemical reaction (s).

These materials dissociate into anhydrous salts and release water vapor when subjected to heat source. The latter salt has the capability to store the energy that was supplied for dehydration upon heating. This thermal energy can be extracted by flowing cooler water or water vapor through the salt to obtain sensible heat that can be exploited for several applications. such as heating residential buildings during cold seasons. In this study. a numerical model that describes the overall thermochemical process of salt hydrates when being heated is developed.

1331385,Modeling the non-equilibrium behavior of chemically reactive atomistic level systems using steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics,2013,Omar Abdulaziz Al-Abbasi,,,,,,Predicting the kinetics of a chemical reaction is a challenging task. particularly for systems in states far from equilibrium. This work discusses the use of a relatively new theory known as intrinsic quantum thermodynamics (IQT) and its mathematical framework steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics (SEA-QT) to predict the reaction kinetics at atomistic levels of chemically reactive systems in the non-equilibrium realm. IQT has emerged over the last three decades as the theory that not only unifies two of the three theories of physical reality. namely. quantum mechanics (QM). and thermodynamics but as well provides a physical basis for both the entropy and entropy production. The SEA-QT framework is able to describe the evolution in state of a system undergoing a dissipative process based on the principle of steepest-entropy ascent or locally-maximal-entropy generation. The work presented in this dissertation demonstrates for the first time the use of the SEA-QT framework to model the evolution in state of a chemically reactive system as its state relaxes to stable equilibrium. This framework brings a number of benefits to the field of reaction kinetics. Among these is the ability to predict the unique non-equilibrium (kinetic) thermodynamic path which the state of the system follows in relaxing to stable equilibrium. As a consequence. the reaction rate kinetics at every instant of time is known as are the chemical affinities. the reaction coordinates. the direction of reaction. the activation energies. the entropy. the entropy production. etc. All is accomplished without any limiting assumption of stable or pseudo-stable equilibrium.

The IQT framework satisfies the laws of quantum mechanics as well as thermodynamics and provides an alternative. comprehensive. and reasonable means for modeling nonequilibrium processes even far from equilibrium. It does so without the need for any of the a priori limiting assumptions common to most conventional methods in the literature such as that of stable equilibrium via a specific choice of temperature or of pseudo-equilibrium between reactants and activated complex. The IQT framework assumes time evolution along the steepest entropy ascent path in state space and is. in fact. able to predict a unique non-equilibrium path. which the system takes in relaxing from a state of non-equilibrium to that of stable equilibrium. and in so doing. dynamically provides a plausible complete picture of the changes occurring in key thermodynamic properties (eg. the instantaneous species concentrations. entropy and entropy generation. reaction coordinate. chemical affinities. reaction rate. etc.) throughout the reaction process.

A lab-scale experimental setup was built consisting of a parabolic reflector coupled by a radiant heating coil. a glass plate and water tray with an insulation cover. Two parameters were investigated in the experimental phase of the study. namely. heat flux and inlet air flow rate. The mathematical model was validated against the experimental findings. and the results were in a close agreement. In addition to the heat flux and air flow rate. the effect of the height of the humidification channel was investigated theoretically.

1331390,Dynamic CFD modelling of an industrial-scale dead-end ultrafiltration system: Full cycle and complete blockage,2021,Omar Al-Abbasi and Mohamed Bin Shams,40,Journal of Water Process Engineering,,101887,Elsevier,In this work. a computation fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to analyze the filtration process of an industrial-scale dead-end hollow fiber membrane commonly used in the pretreatment stage at desalination plants. In this model. the Navier-Stokes and the mass transport equations were formulated and solved using the finite element method. The results predicted by the model were in close agreement with the experimental data. Although several studies simulated the flux decline of a forward filtration process. yet limited studies considered the backwash phase explicitly. Accordingly. this work focuses on both the forward and backwash processes and successfully simulated different flow conditions. including the complete filtration blockage case.

1331393,Numerical Study and Second Law Analysis of Propeller-Type Vortex Generator in A Circular Pipe Flow,,Omar Al-Abbasi,,,,,,In this study. the heat transfer and the thermo-hydraulic performance of pipe flow with propeller-type vortex generator inserts at the pipe inlet are numerically examined. The geometric effect of the blade angle associated with different air mass flow rates on the thermal performances was determined. In the present work. four-blade angles. 15. 30 45. and 60 were considered over a range of Reynolds number that was varied from 5000 to 30.000. A mathematical model was developed to simulate the flow. Thermal characteristics of the model and the governing equations were discretized and solved using finite element method in three-dimensional steady flow. The results were compared with existing experimental data. A good agreement was observed between the model and the experiment. Larger average heat transfer coefficient was achieved for a smaller blade angle. and on average. a reduction of 15 in the blade angle resulted in a 4% increase in the outlet temperature as well as an 8% increase in the Nusselt number. The augmented vortex generator caused a sudden rise in the local heat transfer coefficient after the insert. and later a cyclic behavior for this coefficient is experienced.

In this study. the combined effect of heating and humidifying processes in the plate type humidification chamber. the so-called solar air humidifier is investigated experimentally and using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. A lab-scale experimental setup was built consisting of a parabolic reflector coupled by a radiant heating coil. a glass plate and water tray with an insulation cover. Two parameters were investigated in the experimental phase of the study. namely. heat flux and inlet air flow rate. The mathematical model was validated against the experimental findings. and the results were in a close agreement. In addition to the heat flux and air flow rate. the effect of the height of the humidification channel was investigated theoretically.

A pilot-scale coal combustor was used to investigate the formation of organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) aerosols under various combustion conditions. It was found that BC aerosol formation was extremely sensitive to the fuel–oxidizer equivalence ratio: its concentration decreased from 236 μg/m3 to 2.4 μg/m3. when the equivalence ratio was reduced from 0.92 to 0.80. However. the emissions of inorganic and OC aerosols were not sensitive to the fuel–oxidizer equivalence ratio. The formation of OC aerosols seemed to be enhanced by decreasing the fuel–oxidizer equivalence ratio. which was opposite to the change of BC aerosol formation.

Results have demonstrated that emission behaviour during oxy-coal combustion with 27% O 2/73% CO 2 is almost similar to air-blown combustion. Fuel NO x reduction potential during oxy-coal combustion with the application of oxidant-staging by utilising over-fire oxidant have also been established and includes in-flame measurement of NO x precursors like HCN and NH 3 as well. Results strongly indicate that fuel-NO x formation mechanism in fuel rich condition during oxy-coal combustion is similar to air-blown combustion and the state-of the art Low NO x technology is applicable to reduce NO x emissions under oxy-coal conditions as well. Fate of NO recycled back into the furnace during staged as well as un-staged combustion have been investigated by injecting known concentration of NO into the furnace and there are firm evidences that reduction of recycled NO x is completely dependent on local stoichiometry. the time available to interact with hydrocarbon radicals and the location of injection of NO. Investigation carried out so far on the fate SO 2 when using Lignite coal has revealed that recycled SO 2 is not reduced at all in the high temperature radiative section of the furnace.

Oxy-combustion plants operate by removing most of the nitrogen contained in air prior to combustion. thereby burning fuel in a near-pure oxygen stream instead of air. This combustion produces a flue gas containing primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor that allows relatively straightforward CO2 capture. First-generation. atmospheric oxy-combustion technology relies on a flue gas recycle (FGR) diluent to reduce the peak temperatures achieved and the resulting high thermal radiation levels that would otherwise occur in a fuel/oxygen only flame. In contrast. by staging the combustion in several steps. SPOC reduces the peak temperatures of combustion without resorting to a high degree of FGR to control flame temperatures. The SPOC process operates by utilizing two or more pressurized boiler modules connected in series to produce fuel staging; hence. only a portion of the fuel is combusted in any given combustion module. Subsequently the thermal energy released at each stage can be captured and removed from the gases prior to subsequent stages. when more fuel is introduced. This allows the SPOC process to operate with minimal FGR. avoiding the associated efficiency losses and additional costs.,True,NoIJp3QAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3365980,17025118759580529901,/scholar?cites=17025118759580529901,,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1468536,0,0,0

Gas flame measurements with natural-gas were also performed to investigate gas-phase NOx chemistry. Gas-phase NOx formation during oxy-fuel combustion is also dependent on interaction of HCN and NH{sub 3} with NO and the combustion rate of natural-gas in air and 27% O{sub 2}/73% CO{sub 2} are similar. In-flame measurements during oxy-coal combustion to investigate the progress of combustion and emission formation have demonstrated that oxy-coal combustion with 27% O{sub 2}/73% CO{sub 2} behaves almost similarly like air-blown combustion. Fuel NOx reduction potential during oxy-coal combustion with over-fire oxidant staging have also been investigated and includes measurement of in-flame NOx precursors like HCN and NH{sub 3}. Results strongly indicate that fuel-NOx reduction mechanism in fuel rich region during oxy-coal combustion is similar to air-blown combustion.

All experiments. so far. have been carried out in an electrically heated 20 kW atmospheric pulverised coal combustion facility where uniform and constant temperature up to 1400{sup o}C can be maintained. Different concentrations of CO{sub 2} and O{sub 2} were injected into the furnace using commercially available cylinders to simulate oxy-fuel combustion with flue-gas recirculation. Two-colour pyrometer was used for the determination of coal particle temperature primarily in near burner zone. Three types of coals ranging from high volatile brown coal to medium volatile bituminous coals of three different particle fractions were used and investigations were carried out with different O{sub 2}:CO{sub 2} volumetric ratio as well as with air for comparison purpose. Results from ignition experiments indicate that oxy-fuel combustion with 27% O{sub 2} closely resembles air combustion. For the investigation of emission behaviour during oxy-fuel firing. combustion tests using lignite and medium volatile bituminous coal have been conducted so far and the concentration of different pollutants in flue-gas as well as burnout at the reactor outlet and also along the length of the reactor has been measured.

Thus. these vehicles require flow control techniques to reduce flow phenomena such as boundary layer separation or laminar separation bubble (LSB) affecting aerodynamic performance negatively. This chapter presents a detailed review of traditional passive control techniques for flight vehicle applications operating at low Reynolds numbers. In addition to the traditional methods. a new concept of the pre-stall controller by means of roughness material. flexibility and partial flexibility is highlighted with experimental and numerical results. Results indicate that passive flow control methods can dramatically increase the aerodynamic performance of the aforementioned vehicles by controlling the LSB occurring in the pre-stall region. The control of the LSB with new concept pre-stall control techniques provides lift increment and drag reduction by utilizing significantly less matter consumption and low energy. In particular. new types of these methods presented for the first time by the chapter’s authors have enormously influenced the progress of separation and LSB. resulting in postponing of the stall and enhancing the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine applications.,True,AyTT6AsAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,1,https://www.intechopen.com/books/autonomous-vehicles/traditional-and-new-types-of-passive-flow-control-techniques-to-pave-the-way-for-high-maneuverabilit,11743816853600941720,/scholar?cites=11743816853600941720,,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/autonomous-vehicles/traditional-and-new-types-of-passive-flow-control-techniques-to-pave-the-way-for-high-maneuverabilit,0,0,0

Theoretical. and Computational Methods,2015,YunTao Chen,,,,,,Partially premixed combustion has the merits of lower emission as well as higher efficiency. However. its practical application has been hindered by its inherent instabilities. This work is a study of instabilities in partially premixed combustion. through a combination of numerical simulation. theoretical modeling. and experimental investigation. with the hope of furthering our understanding of the underlying physics. Specifically. a Flamelet/Progress Variable (FPV) combustion model in the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is extended to simulate a piloted (partially) premixed jet burner (PPJB). The ability and shortcomings of this state-of-the-art high fidelity combustion model are assessed.

In order to evaluate the effect of classification. the authors of this study gathered the annual energy consumption data of 5.869 retail facilities and classified the samples into 11 categories. Except for a few comparisons. each category showed statistically significant differences in average energy use intensity (EUI). The results implied that classification by retail category contributes to developing a more appropriate benchmark. This study then discusses the normalization of EUI for each retail category. The factors affecting EUI can be divided into two categories: those that cannot be controlled by the owner of retail facilities for improving energy efficiency. such as total floor area and climate. and those that can be controlled. The former factors must be taken into account in normalization. In this paper. a simple regression analysis between EUI and total floor area was carried out to quantify the influence of the size of facility on EUI. The result showed that the influence of facility size is significantly different among retail categories. Additionally. the standard deviation of the distribution of the difference between actual EUI and normalized EUI is different among retail categories. This result implies that the yardstick used to describe the unit of EUI must be developed for each retail category.,True,gx-wMHYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,5,https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000087.pdf,13851820939640051427,/scholar?cites=13851820939640051427,,,https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000087.pdf,0,0,0

1331480,Heat transfer in RF plasma sintering: Modeling and experiments,1997,NP Tandian and E Pfender,17,Plasma chemistry and plasma processing,3,353-370,Springer US,The mechanisms of heat transfer from an argon RF plasma. generated in a water-cooled quartz tube. to a sintering sample immersed into the plasma and to the walls of the plasma torch have been studied both analytically and experimentally for pressures from 1 to 50 torr. The model. based on the assumption of chemical equilibrium in a two-temperature plasma with rotational symmetry. includes the influence of the magnetic field and of the Knudsen number on the thermal conductivity of the plasma.

1331521,Optimization of Centrifugal Slurry Pump Through the Splitter Blades Position,2021,Ehsan Abdolahnejad and Mahdi Moghimi and Shahram Derakhshan,,,,,,Optimal transfer of two-phase solid-liquid flow (slurry flow) has long been a major industrial challenge. Slurry pumps are among the most common types of centrifugal pumps used to deal with this transfer issue. The approach of improving slurry pumps and consequently increasing the efficiency of a flow transmission system requires overcoming the effects of slurry flow such as the reduction in head. efficiency. and wear. This study attempts to investigate the changes in the pump head by modifying the slip factor distribution in the impeller channel. For this purpose. the effect of splitter blades on slip factor distribution to improve the pump head was investigated using numerical simulation tools and validated based on experimental test data. Next. an optimization process was used to determine the characteristics of the splitter (ie. length. number. and environmental position of the splitter) based on a combination of experimental design methods. surface response. and genetic algorithm. The optimization results indicate that the splitters were in a relative circumferential position of 67.2% to the suction surface of the main blade. Also. the optimal number and length of splitter blades were 6 and 62.8% of the length of the main blades. respectively. Because of adding splitter blades and the reduction in the flow passage. the best efficiency point (BEP) of the slurry pump moved toward lower flow rates. The result of splitter optimization was the increase in pump head from 29.7 m to 31.7 m and the upkeep of efficiency in the initial values.,True,DB-0l3oAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-155416/latest.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-155416/latest.pdf,0,0,0

The initial position and size of inclusions are significant to the formation process of surface damage. 50 μm Al2O3 inclusion located at the 1/8 of sheet thickness is easily rolled to the surface and causes the surface damage. Morphology of Al2O3 inclusion is difficult to change due to the higher hardness and larger elastic modulus. However. the Al2O3 inclusion can be crushed into pieces. which increase the damage of steel matrices.

To date. only a few suitable potassium storage materials have been reported due to the large-sized potassium ions and sluggish kinetics. Herein. we design a three-layered heterostructure with porous metallic TiNb₂O₆ as the core and carbon-encapsulated MoS₂ nanosheets as the shell (denoted as TiNb₂O₆@ MoS₂/C) as an advanced anode for KIBs. This hybrid configuration can significantly enhance the electronic conductivity from the interior to the exterior by virtue of the oxygen-atom-unsaturated metallic TiNb₂O₆ core. Furthermore. the amorphous carbon shell plays a crucial role to inhibit the particle agglomeration. accommodate the volume expansion and protect the active material from pulverization because of the three-layered heterostructure. As a result. impressive electrochemical behavior with high capacity (424 mA hg⁻ ¹ at 0.1 A g⁻ ¹ after 50 cycles) and high cycling stability (175 mA hg⁻ ¹ at 1.0 A g⁻ ¹ after 300 cycles) is achieved.

However. the large volume expansion and inevitable electrode pulverization during cycling are the urgent problems to be solved. Herein. the Sn element is introduced to form Sn-doped V₂O₅ (denoted as SDVO) via partially replacing V with Sn. Strong (001) facet-induced growth promotes the conversion of V₂O₅ from nanoparticles to nanosheets. The multi-hierarchical structure is composed of a primary mesoporous structure. secondary SDVO nanosheets and a tertiary three-dimensional (3D) tremella-like nanostructure. Notably. the 3D tremella-like nanostructure assembled from two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets can curb the volume expansion of V₂O₅. Furthermore. the tremella-like architecture with abundant mesopores and a large surface area can reduce the transmission path of K ions and increase the reaction active sites. First-principles calculations show that Sn doping can induce the preferred orientation of the (001) crystal facet in V₂O₅ and improve the overall electronic conductivity of SDVO. Benefiting from these designed features. the SDVO composite with an optimized electrolyte exhibits a high capacity of 308 mA h g⁻¹ at 0.1 A g⁻¹ after 150 cycles and excellent cycle stability of 188 mA h g⁻¹ even after 3000 cycles at 0.5 A g⁻¹.,True,VcgNfeYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6768315,,,,,,0,0,0

However. a few small cracks still appear during the continuous casting of special steel. For instance. cracks often appear at the corner of the billet during the production of hypo‐peritectic microalloyed steel. Most research on the causes of corner cracks in hypo‐peritectic microalloyed steel has focused on investigating the hot ductility of steel and not considered the shrinkage characteristics during solidification. In this study. the hot ductility behavior show that cracks are not related to the hot brittleness of steel. We focus on the effects of alloy composition on the phase evolution and shrinkage of steel during solidification. Uneven solidification leads to excessive shrinkage of the corners in the billet. and an air gap is generated between the billet and the mold.

Maximization of profit is chosen as the main objective with additional sub-objective-to reduce the number of startups and shutdowns of generating units. The random nature of future electricity prices and river water inflow is taken into account. We use an artificial neural network-based algorithm to forecast market prices and water inflow. Uncertainty modeling is introduced to represent the stochastic nature of parameters and to solve the short-term optimization problem of profit-based unit commitment.

Some currently already available storage options such as hydropower are considered. but attention is given to an emerging technology - hydrogen storage - as well. An algorithm for storage plant scheduling optimization is devised. In the case study. it is concluded that both technologies are capable of exploiting the price spread in the day-ahead electricity market.

Real-world data of electric load. heating demand. electricity prices and ambient temperature was used for simulations to conclude that while a small penetration of smart storage heating can facilitate efficient usage of the existing distribution grid. larger penetrations can require grid reinforcements due to a significantly increased electric load. These effects could be partly mitigated using smart charging algorithms for storage heaters.

As a result of the BEMIP implementation. the wholesale power markets of the three Baltic states have been well coupled with the Nordic countries by joining the Nord Pool power exchange in 2010 (Estonia). 2012 (Lithuania) and 2013 (Latvia) respectively [3]. Now. electricity producers and traders from the Baltic states successfully operate in both day-ahead and intraday market of the Nord Pool where the majority of wholesale transactions take place. Nevertheless. the Baltic power system still has some distinct characteristics from the rest of Europe due to its synchronous operation with the Integrated/Unified Power System (IPS/UPS) of Russia and Belarus. The Russian power system provides primary power reserves for frequency regulation and secure system operation within the BRELL (Belarus. Russia. Estonia. Latvia. and Lithuania) ring [4]. The synchronous operation of the Baltic states with the IPS/UPS is planned to be terminated by 2025 which is the deadline to complete the synchronisation of the Baltic power grid with the Continental Europe network [5]. However. in order to increase the energy independence of the Baltic states and involve more local balancing resources in power system regulation already several years before the planned desynchronisation. the TSOs of Latvia.

1331586,The Analysis of Pine Needles as a Substance for Gasification,2014,Alok Dhaundiyal and V.K. Gupta,,Hydro Nepa,,,Hydra Nepa,The forests of Chir pine (Pinus Roxburgii) encompass 97.4 thousand acres or 16.15% of the total forest land of Uttrakhand. a state in India. According to Forest Department of India. Dehradun. a massive forest fire in 1995 engulfed 14.7 thousand acres of valuable forest area through 2.272 forest fire incidents in Uttrakhand. which resulted in the loss of crores of rupees and created various long-lasting ecological consequences. The fires damaged the fertile top layer of the soil and left a layer of pine needle litter that prevented rain water from being absorbed by the soil and contributed to early depletion of the groundwater cycle and stopped grass growth. thus depriving livestock of important food. So the question of what to do with these pine needles is an important one for forest and livestock. Regarding this problem. the German organization. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit. has been studying ways to use pine needles as a feedstock for downdraft gasifiers. If successful. the gasifier would provide incentive to collect the pine needles during dry months and improve the condition of the soil by allowing water to permeate top soils. Using chemical analysis. flue gas analysis. and combustion analysis. our paper analyzes the potential of pine needles as a substrate for gasification. We also argue that using pine needles in this way would alleviate carbon dioxide emissions due to forest fire. Average carbon dioxide emissions in forests that have an abundance of pine needles is 15.46%. but reduced to 12.8% when pine needles are used in a gasifier plant.,True,Aw40A7cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,28,https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/hn/article/view/11299,8173415986494675573,/scholar?cites=8173415986494675573,,,https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/HN/article/view/11299/9154,0,0,0

Res.,1,66-70,,Depletion of fossil fuels and environmental pollution concern has led researchers to develop alternate fuels. Alcohols are promising alternative. Ethanol can be blended in gasoline without modification in engine to improve performance characteristics. Since. field testing is expensive and time consuming and moreover it is difficult to maintain favourable condition throughout the experiment. Hence it is easy and convenient to carry out the simulation study in MATLAB environment. This paper put emphasis on the study of engine performance characteristics with ethanol-gasoline blend. a cylinder by cylinder model is designed in MATLAB/Simulink. Whole model is built in the form of blocks which are differential and empirical formulas of engine parameters. These formulas are describing the engine behaviour with respect to crank angle. The pressure inside the cylinder is predicted with another line of information of heat input. Heat input needs data from the mass flow and burn characteristics of combustible fuel which is described by Weibe function. Pressure obtained will be converted to mean effective pressure by subtracting frictional losses. Finally the brake mean effective pressure is calculated. The parameters calculated are brake power. brake specific fuel consumption. fuel consumed. brake thermal efficiency. burn duration and exhaust gas temperature. In this study it is found that ethanol blend with gasoline increases brake power and brake thermal efficiency by lowering the exhaust gas temperature.,True,Aw40A7cAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,6,https://www.academia.edu/download/47840960/IJER_2016_117.pdf,16816082244291467964,/scholar?cites=16816082244291467964,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47840960/IJER_2016_117.pdf,0,0,0

The best way to use vegetable oil as a fuel is convert it into biodiesel. Biodiesel is basically a methyl or ethyl ester which is produced by transesterification process. Transesterification is the reaction of fat or oil with an alcohol to form ester and glycerol. In present investigation neem oil ethyl ester (NOEE) is prepared by two step ie esterification followed by transesterification because neem oil contains high free fatty acid. Further the physical. chemical and thermal properties of NOEE are checked and it is found that the properties of NOEE are very much comparable with the diesel.

Production of novel dairy ingredients through membrane processes that can be used in different foods based on their functional properties is now largely spread out. particularly after the commercialization of high mechanical and physico-chemical resistant mineral membranes. Membrane processes are increasingly being used because of their several inherent advantages like energy efficient process; easy. simple and economical operation; improved recovery of constituents and better yield of products and minimum thermal degradation problems. resulting in better nutritional and functional properties of milk constituents.The main membrane systems in ascending order of pore size are: reverse osmosis (RO). nonofiltration (NF). ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF). The distinction between the various membrane processes is somewhat arbitrary and has evolved with usage and time. In a broader sense RO is essentially a dewatering technique.

CLEANING AND SANITIZATION OF MEMBRANES,2004,Vijay Kumar Gupta,,ADVANCES IN CLEANING AND SANITATION IN FOOD INDUSTRY,,169,,Fouling of membranes represents major problem area and calls for special knowledge of operating skills and cleaning procedures. Like all other industrial equipments. membrane filtration plants have to be cleaned at regular intervals. Today we have a variety of membranes available with differences in chemical and temperature resistance. The most important consideration in cleaning and maintenance is never to allow the feed constituents to dry out on the membrane surface. Shutting down the system during operation and leaving the treated fluid in contact with membranes for 1-2 min results in severe fouling (Renner and El-Salam. 1991). Cleaning of membranes has to be efficient. easy. fast with no risk to the membrane and the rest of the installation. Besides. it must completely meet the sanitary requirements. The cleaning reagents and operating parameters such as pressure. flow velocity and temperature. are dictated by the feed and the resulting fouling. Better understanding and controlling of these parameters can determine the performance and lifetime of the membrane. The prevalent method for achieving these objectives is to perform in-place cleaning procedure followed by a sanitary step. In most cases the cleaning of membrane filtration system can be accomplished by using cleaning agents recommended by the manufacturer. The advent of high resistant membranes has in many respects made cleaning easier than before.,True,Aw40A7cAAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC,0,http://www.dairyprocessingcaft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Advances-in-Cleaning-and-Sanitation-in-Food-Industry-2004.pdf#page=120,,,,,http://www.dairyprocessingcaft.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Advances-in-Cleaning-and-Sanitation-in-Food-Industry-2004.pdf#page=120,0,0,0

Investigation of the cell operation is conducted by using formic acid as a fuel and sodium perborate as an oxidant for the first time under “acid-alkaline media” configurations. The MLSPBFC architecture enables interchangeable operation with different media combinations. The experimental results indicate that operating under “acid-alkaline media” conditions significantly improves the fuel cell performance compared with all-acidic and all-alkaline conditions. The effects of flow rates and the concentrations of various species at both the anode and cathode on the cell performance are also investigated.

This research project undertook the design. testing. model creation and tuning. performance evaluation. and optimization of a dual tank SAHP system for domestic hot water (DHW).

The induction time of nucleation increases with the increase of the isothermal temperature under which crystallization occurred. Crystal growth has been observed by microscopy showing that both crystal morphologies. fibers and rosettes. grow linearly at the initial stage of crystallization and then slow down to reach a plateau value. The Avrami model. which has been widely used in kinetics studies of triacylglycerol systems. was employed to fit experimental results at different isothermal temperatures. It was found that experimental trends could be captured by introducing the volume fraction of each type of morphology into three-dimensional and one-dimensional full Avrami models.,True,4VXG9GEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11746-013-2318-9.pdf,14250487199006799237,/scholar?cites=14250487199006799237,,,,0,0,0

For example. steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is an effective technology for exploiting oil sands deposits. It provides a sustainable strategy to access deep reservoirs that cannot be tackled by surface mining. However. a large amount of slop oil generated in SAGD process is undesired. Treating the produced slop oil still faces many technical challenges mainly due to its complexity and commercial constraints.

Developing effective REBs remains challenging due to the poor understanding of influencing factors and demulsification mechanisms.

1331657,STUDY OF CRYSTAL MORPHOLOGIES OF HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL AS A RHEOLOGY MODIFIER,2012,Dingzheng Yang,,,,,,Hydrogenated castor oil (HCO) crystals as a rheology modifier have been widely used in paints. cosmetics and household products. In this thesis. we are interested in the effect of crystal morphology on the suspension rheology of products. Three major types of micron-sized crystal morphologies have been observed: fiber. rosette and irregular crystal. Fibers show a high aspect ratio with the length ranging from 5 to 33 µm and width around 1~3 µm. The rosette (2~50 µm) is a three-dimensional spherulitic structure with nano-fibrous arms extruding from a heterogeneous central point. Irregular crystals with equivalent diameter ranging from 4 to 84 µm are hard solid and show irregular shapes. There is an additional fourth type of crystal morphology which is a nano-sized fibrous structure that is assumed to be broken down from arms of micron-sized rosettes and fibers. Due to the relatively small amount. the effects of nano-fibrous fragments on rheology were not considered separately in this work.The effect of temperature and shear history on the HCO crystal morphology has been studied. The energy barrier to nucleation for fibers is suggested to be higher than that of rosettes. Irregular crystals are thermodynamically less stable and tend to transform into stable polymorphs. A non-isothermal crystallization study showed that the formation of rosettes and fibers was favored by a slow cooling rate (1°C/min) while the formation of irregular crystals was favored by a fast cooling rate (5°C/min). Shear rates from zero to 100 s-1 have been applied at cooling rates from 1°C/min to 5°C/min. Nucleation has been found to be promoted with the increase of shear rate …,True,4VXG9GEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/12275,,,,,https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/12275/1/fulltext.pdf,0,0,0

Such measurements and detailed geomechanical models are required to identify zones at risk of casing collapse due to shear stress buildups. Such zones tend to occur in problematic ductile formations such as salt and swelling clays that are prone to creep.

1331688,Development of a New Comprehensive Model for Choke Performance Correlation in Iranian Oil Wells,2014,Hamzeh Ghorbani and Jamshid Moghadasi,8,Advances in Environmental Biology,17,877-882,,Choke in a producing well is responsible for controlling the production. There are some tools to control the flow rate. These tools are used for the following purposes [12]. To prevent enough back pressure to stop sand entry.A) To safe surface equipment from high pressure. B) To protect gas or water coning. C) To keeping the reservoir at the optimum flow rate. Several correlations have been proposed for explaining critical and subcritical multiphase flow through wellhead chokes [2]. These correlations are based on limited ranges of flow variables. The validity of these correlations is limited. based on quality and range of data. Gilbert (1954) developed the most popular correlation. When the upstream pressure of the choke is at least 70% higher than the downstream pressure or when the ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure is equal to 0.588 [7]. However. rather than Gilbert’s equation in the literature other researchers introduce different correlations.

1331706,The effect of component junction tapering on miniature cryocooler performance,2012,Ted Conrad and Mihir G Pathak and S Mostafa Ghiaasiaan and Carl Kirkconnell,1434,AIP Conference Proceedings,1,435-442,American Institute of Physics,Due to their relatively smaller volume and available cooling power. miniature cryocoolers are likely to be more sensitive to hydrodynamic losses than their full scale counterparts. Abrupt changes in diameter between cryocooler components are a possible source of such losses as flow separation and recirculation may occur at these points. Underutilization of regions of the regenerator and heat exchanger porous matrices may also occur due to jetting of fluid into these components. Eliminating such abrupt diameter changes by tapering transitions between cryocooler components may therefore improve system performance. The effects of various tapers applied at component interfaces on the performance of miniature pulse tube cryocoolers were investigated using system-level CFD models.

The objective is to examine the enhancement of heat transfer in heat exchangers by flow pulsation. Laminar 2-D pulsating flow of air through homogeneous arrays of ten rows of heated square rods is simulated for frequencies of 0-80 Hz. Cycle-average and maximum drag coefficients. and cycle-average Nusselt numbers are reported for each of the ten rods in the simulated array. A wake interference effect was observed which significantly amplifies the drag on the leading rods and reduces and instantaneously reverses the sign of the drag force on the rods located in the wake region. Cycle average drag is found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number and porosity. and is only a weak function of pulsation frequency.

Using room temperature helium as the working fluid. stacked discs of #635 stainless steel and #325 phosphor bronze wire meshes were subjected to an oscillatory flow field. Dynamic pressure transducers recorded waveforms upstream and downstream of the porous section at charge pressures of 2.86 and 3.55 MPa. Tests were performed in the axial direction at frequencies ranging from 50 to 200 Hz. Hydrodynamic parameters were determined using a CFD-assisted methodology. The experimental test section and its vicinity were simulated using the Fluent code and mesh fillers were modeled as a porous structure. Model porous media hydrodynamic parameters were iteratively adjusted to match the model predictions to the experimental results.

Building-Scale Liquid Air Energy Storage and Expansion System: Energy and Exergy Analysis,2018,Todd Howe and Anthony Pollman and Anthony Gannon,20,Entropy,770,1-17,MDPI,This paper presents the results of an ideal theoretical energy and exergy analysis for a combined. building scale Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES) and expansion turbine system. This work identifies the upper bounds of energy and exergy efficiency for the combined LAES-expansion system which has not been investigated. The system uses the simple Linde-Hampson and pre-cooled Linde-Hampson cycles for the liquefaction subsystem and direct expansion method. with and without heating above ambient temperature. for the energy production subsystem. In addition. the paper highlights the effectiveness of precooling air for liquefaction and heating air beyond ambient temperature for energy production. Finally. analysis of the system components is presented with an aim toward identifying components that have the greatest impact on energy and exergy efficiencies in an ideal environment. This work highlights the engineering trade-space and serves as a prescription for determining the merit or measures of effectiveness for an engineered LAES system in terms of energy and exergy. The analytical approach presented in this paper may be applied to other LAES configurations in order to identify optimal operating points in terms of energy and exergy efficiencies.

To delineate the RISA effect in actual boiling systems or in a high-temperature and high-pressure environment. this study aimed at obtaining the contact angle. an indicator of macroscopic surface wettability. of water droplets on various materials such as stainless steel. aluminum and zircaloy plates before and after {gamma}-ray irradiation at ambient temperatures up to 300degC. Before {gamma}-ray irradiation or under the conditions without the RISA effect. measured contact angles decreased when the temperature was below 250degC. clustered around a straight line at temperatures below 120degC. and clustered around another line in the range from 120 to 250degC. At temperatures above 250degC. contact angles remained constant independent of temperature. and contrary to the existing theoretical model. no highly hydrophilic condition or null contact angle condition was achieved. The effects of ambient pressure. gas atmosphere. and material type on the contact angle condition were insignificant. On the other hand. after {gamma}-ray irradiation or conditions with the RISA effect. super-hydrophilicity or null contact angle was achieved after 830 kGy {gamma}-ray irradiation where the temperature was less than 200degC. At temperatures exceeding 200degC. super-hydrophilicity by the RISA effect was not achieved even after 2700 kGy {gamma}-ray irradiation. although a slight improvement in surface wettability was confirmed.

Islanded Microgrid …,2019,Christopher Girouard and Anthony Pollman and Alejandro Hernandez,,,,,,Effective use and integration of renewable energy sources. coupled with different storage options. is an emerging priority within the Department of Defense. One promising method of energy storage is a Liquid Air Energy Storage system (LAES). which uses renewable energy in excess of immediate demand to make and cryogenically store liquid air for later expansion through a turbine to generate power when needed. This paper outlines a modeling and simulation approach to determining the design and material specifications based on a supply requirement of a renewable energy fed LAES. The source power requirement was based on the available renewable generation at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Turbo-Propulsion Laboratory of 18 kW. These models revised previous validated versions. which were used to design a small-scale theoretical LAES system. to yield an integrated. practical. building-scale simulation. The expansion and generation portion of a LAES system was simulated for a Linde-Hampson cycle using the process modeling software Aspen HYSYS. The results from this model. along with a demand side analysis. will be used to map the trade space of a LAES system and determine potential commercial components for system construction.

1331746,COMSOL Multiphysics® Simulation of TEGs for Waste Thermal Energy Harvesting,2018,L Howard and D Tafone and D Grbovic and A Pollman,,,,,,The US Navy relies on power to operate its systems effectively to complete missions worldwide. Many of these systems generate thermal energy. which is typically lost to the environment and not useful within the system. Capturing the energy that would otherwise be lost and recycling it in the system provides the opportunity to improve the system's efficiency. reduce heat signatures. and decrease some cooling requirements. Thermoelectric Generators (TEGs). which create voltage when exposed to a temperature differential. have the potential to recover the waste heat from naval systems and recycle it back into the system. Modeling and simulation helps establish the feasibility of building a tabletop prototype. thus helping explore whether TEGs have the potential to increase the energy efficiency of military systems. The purpose of this study was to build a model in COMSOL® to simulate a potential prototype system of a TEG array on the muffler of a portable generator. The model will help determine the temperature difference between the TEG sidings. as a measure of the array’s efficiency. COMSOL® simulation showed that the average temperature difference between the TEG sidings was 37.52 C. COMSOL® modeling effort’s output will inform design. construction. and testing of a tabletop TEG array energy harvesting prototype for employment on the generator exhaust.

These transients are challenging for the code.           The experimental phase began by constructing and calibrating a simplified. integral. condensation-driven transient apparatus named the UMD-USNA Near One-dimensional Transient Experimental Assembly (MANOTEA).  Then. a series of 5 well-defined transients were run.  Data from the facility included:  pressure. differential pressure. and temperature. all as a function of time.  Using the data. mass and energy balances were closed for each experiment. Some of the relevant characteristics of the data included: inverted thermal stratification and nozzle dependent transients controlled by an energy partition.

1331752,Modeling and Simulation Approach to Support Component Selection for Demand-based Building-scale LAES System,2019,Nicholas Bailey and Anthony Pollman and Eugene Paulo,,,,,,Islanded. renewably powered microgrids require energy storage or emergency generation to overcome intermittency. Batteries and fossil fuel generators have traditionally filled these roles. However. liquid air energy storage (LAES) is a promising alternative. Using power in excess of immediate demand. a LAES system can liquefy and cryogenically store ambient air. When renewable generation abates. the liquid air can be expanded through a turbine to provide power to the microgrid. Using a modeling and simulation approach. this paper explores the requirements for a Linde-Hampson based LAES system to satisfy a building scale (5 kW) demand for five hours.

1331753,Modeling and Simulation Approach to Inform TEG Waste Heat Harvesting Prototype for Fossil Fuel Exhaust,2019,Lauren Howard and Dragoslav Grbovic and Anthony Pollman,,,,,,Many military systems produce thermal energy as a by-product. Generally. this so-called waste heat is lost to the surroundings. Capturing the waste heat and putting it to beneficial use could increase the efficiency of military systems. while having the added benefit of reducing thermal signatures. This paper outlines the application of modeling and simulation to estimate the usable electric power produced by a thermoelectric generator (TEG) array on the exhaust muffler of a small fossil fuel generator. The simulation results informed design. construction. and testing of an initial prototype. Key prototype test variables were temperature difference. load resistance. and electric current. The results of the experiment were compared to and used to update the initial model. This small-scale effort provides initial insight into the efficacy of applying thermoelectric generators to military systems. Future work will explore larger arrays. as well as detailed investigation of the tradespace to identify promising equipment or applications. and inform capability and acquisitions requirements.,True,NEMr41YAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,3,https://avestia.com/EHST2019_Proceedings/files/paper/EHST_134.pdf,2688804889607073976,/scholar?cites=2688804889607073976,,,https://avestia.com/EHST2019_Proceedings/files/paper/EHST_134.pdf,0,0,0

1331757,Energy Recovery for Dual-Stirling Liquid Air Energy Storage Prototype,2020,Nicholas Bailey and Anthony Pollman and Eugene Paulo,,,,1-6,,Islanded. renewably powered microgrids require energy storage or emergency generation to overcome intermittency. Batteries and fossil fuel generators have traditionally filled these roles. However. liquid air energy storage (LAES) is a promising alternative. Using power in excess of immediate demand. a LAES system can liquefy and cryogenically store ambient air. When renewable generation abates. the liquid air can be expanded through a turbine to provide power to the microgrid. This study explores energy recovery from a dual Stirling cycle LAES system. Liquid air is generated by a commercial Stirling cryocooler and stored in a vacuum dewar.

This is primarily done to prepare the system specification that forms the basis for the system’s design. By extension. example steps in this process include surveying stakeholders to better capture their intent. deriving and documenting requirements. and then using those requirements for subsequent activities. such as developing a functional baseline and candidate design alternatives. During this process. it is important to consider the full system lifecycle. As such. one major objective of a systems engineer is to translate the stakeholder’s needs into functional and nonfunctional requirements (NFRs).

1331759,Using Modeling and Simulations to Characterize TEG Arrays,2019,Rondolfo Moreno and Dragoslav Grbovic and Anthony Pollman,,,,,,Modeling and simulation are key concepts in systems engineering and system design. They allow the engineer to use fewer resources to establish a sound design before fully committing to building a full prototype. Using this concept. this paper goes through the modeling process for the application of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) in an array. Systems could benefit off using this passive thermal recovery device by converting that thermal energy into electricity. For military systems. this is beneficial as there are many initiatives in the United States military to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels by making current systems more efficient or converting to systems that do not use fossil fuels. Applying TEGs to these particular systems would help with this inititative and possibly have an intrinsic benefit of reducing a system’s thermal signature. which could be a topic of future work. Designing the models and simulation for this application needs to be basic and simple before creating complex models for final design. The types of models built and discussed in this paper will help form the basis of design of an array.

Accurate measurement of HM results in increased utilisation of grass in the herd’s diet and consequently reductions in whole-farm feed inputs. emissions and costs. The rising plate meter (RPM) is an established method of estimating HM. but there is scope to improve its accuracy. Real-time meteorological data and pasture management information have never been analysed in combination with the RPM. This study aimed to utilise such data to improve the accuracy of HM prediction using multiple linear regression (MLR) and machine learning through the random forest (RF) algorithm.

1331774,A Review of Milk Production Forecasting Models: Past & Future Methods,,Fan Zhang and Philip Shine and John Upton and Laurance Shaloo and Michael D Murphy,,,,,,Under European milk quotas. dairy farms in Europe were limited in the amount of milk they could produce. While quotas were gradually increased over the past four decades. European milking quotas totally were abolished in April 2015. to help meet an expected 20% increase in the global consumption of milk and dairy products by 2050. With this. European dairy farmers can freely expand milk production based upon expected milk prices. now controlled by open market supply and demand. With increasing herd sizes and milk production. the ability to predict future production levels using empirical curve fitting prediction models developed on lower levels of milk production becomes problematic. This is due to increased milk production resulting in a larger peak to trough ratios. This problem is more acute in countries with primarily pasture-based dairy farming systems such as Ireland. where the total output of milk production closely follows the pattern of a regular lactation cycle. unlike countries with primarily stall based systems. Many curve fitting techniques rely on regression coefficients based upon the peak production of the lactation cycle. Thus. due to the increase in milk production over time. a classical fitting techniques could become less effective in the future. Therefore. there is a requirement for more modern adaptive techniques for milk production forecasting. This review focuses on milk production forecasting models and data variation from a past and future perspective. A comprehenisve review of model applications and comparisons from studies over the past two decades is carried out.

1331775,A Global Review of Monitoring. Modeling. and Analyses of Water Demand in Dairy Farming,2020,Philip Shine and Michael D Murphy and John Upton,12,,17,7201,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,The production of milk must be balanced with the sustainable consumption of water resources to ensure the future sustainability of the global dairy industry. Thus. this review article aimed to collate and summarize the literature in the dairy water-usage domain. While green water use (eg. rainfall) was found to be largest category of water use on both stall and pasture-based dairy farms. on-farm blue water (ie. freshwater) may be much more susceptible to local water shortages due to the nature of its localized supply through rivers. lakes. or groundwater aquifers. Research related to freshwater use on dairy farms has focused on monitoring. modeling. and analyzing the parlor water use and free water intake of dairy cows. Parlor water use depends upon factors related to milk precooling. farm size. milking systems. farming systems. and washing practices. Dry matter intake is a prominent variable in explaining free water intake variability; however. due to the unavailability of accurate data. some studies have reported moving away from dry matter intake at the expense of prediction accuracy. Machine-learning algorithms have been shown to improve dairy water-prediction accuracy by 23%. which may allow for coarse model inputs without reducing accuracy. Accurate models of on-farm water use allow for an increased number of dairy farms to be used in water footprinting studies. as the need for physical metering equipment is mitigated.

1331793,A range based Multi-Actor Multicriteria Analysis to incorporate uncertainty in stakeholder based evaluation processes,2014,Gino Baudry and Cathy Macharis and Thomas Vallée,,,,,,Increasing concerns about environmental and social impacts have made multicriteria analysis (MCA) increasingly popular in decision making processes. The present paper proposes a new methodology which allows taking into account multicriteria aspects. stakeholder's preferences and long time horizon uncertainty. Relying on the MAMCA methodology developed by Macharis in 2000. we develop a new decision making support tool. the range based MAMCA. Within MAMCA. the different possible solutions or alternatives are evaluated on the objectives of the stakeholders. These evaluations can be however uncertain as there might be a lack of knowledge. lack of experience or future predications might be uncertain. By means of Monte Carlo Simulation a range based MAMCA approach is developed to generate several possible states of the world. While a classical MCA would have provided a single final ranking. encouraging the support of an alternative. which can either be the best or the worst one depending on its performance uncertainty in the long run. The range based MAMCA provides a wide range of possible rankings depending on the many possible states of the world. Thus. it provides scorings. rankings of alternatives and the probability they will occur. The new approach is described and shown by means of an illustrative case: the stakeholder support for different biofuel options.,True,G-19hRYAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,5,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01010513/,4063187400312300603,/scholar?cites=4063187400312300603,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01010513/file/LEMNA_WP_2014-16.pdf,0,0,0

1331798,A range based MAMCA to incorporate uncertainty in the stakeholder based evaluation processes,2014,Gino Baudry and C Macharis and T Vallée,,,,,IAEE,MethodsThe first step of the methodology requires to define the decision making problem and to make a list of possible alternatives. According to the problem. alternatives can take different forms such as site location. technical solutions. policy options or other forms that fit with the need of decision making solutions. Relying on expert’s consultations and literature surveys. the present approach consists in constructing indicators to measure alternative’s contribution to each criterion.Addressing long time horizon issues requires anticipating economic. environmental and social issues through different economic sectors. As a consequence. each alternative’s contribution to criterion can either be better or worse than initially suggested by the expert assessment. The range based MAMCA proposes to substitute each single value by a probability distribution that captures the different scenarios that can occur for every couple criterion/alternative. Hence the process allows characterizing uncertainties on alternatives that contribute to a given criterion whether the initial data are quantitative or qualitative ones. In the present paper. we use triangular distributions to capture the range of possible values between some pessimistic. some most probable and some optimistic values. By use of a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) where each simulation provides a possible state of the world for the different stakeholders. the possible range of solution is generated attributing random performance to each alternative.,True,G-19hRYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7757471022375780754&hl=en&oi=scholarr,7757471022375780754,/scholar?cites=7757471022375780754,,,,0,0,0

1331816,Restructuring the South African electricity supply industry,1994,Grove Steyn,,,,,,In a post-apartheid South Africa. the electricity supply industry (ESI) will be under pressure to make up the backlog in electricity provision to poor households. Simultaneously. it will have to protect its financial viability in order to maintain a low-cost electricity supply to support a growing economy. This study analyses the current structure and governance of the ESI and proposes a significant restructuring to enable these challenges to be met. It is argued that the highly fragmented distribution sector of the ESI should be rationalised. and that the industry should remain in the public sector. Questions around the governance and regulation of the ESI are identified as critical to the future performance of the industry. By drawing on international experience. a distinction is made between the roles of politics and technical expertise in the governance of the ESL On the basis of this distinction. a new governance model is developed. which is based on a contract-plan mechanism. but which relies on the role of stakeholders and an independent regulator. In this way. this thesis attempts to establish in the governance system an appropriate balance between the equity concerns of a new democratic government. and the efficiency needs of a developing economy.,True,0PZvJ-8AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,10,https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/8448,14708466616050256171,/scholar?cites=14708466616050256171,,,https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/handle/11427/8448/thesis_ebe_1994_steyn_g.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

This phase was designed to develop an understanding of present rural electrification practice. and rural energy and development needs. The research also highlighted some key policy questions for rural electrification in South Africa.The paper shows that South Africa embarked on a large-scale rural electrification programme before it clarified fundamental policy questions relating to the intended role of publicly subsidised electricity supply in rural areas. The growth in the proportion of rural connections in the national electrification programme is the unintended result of the structure of available financing mechanisms and utility incentives operating in the electricity supply industry at present.

We have conducted the study in three European Union countries: Denmark. Finland and Portugal. We have modelled the main uncertainties that affect this kind of project. such as the cost and production of electric power. investment costs and consumer price index. For each of these countries. we have analysed the mechanisms of public support for wind energy.

For this evaluation. we have modelled the primary uncertainties affecting the project and we have incorporated the uncertainties arising from public support for renewable energy. These mechanisms generate RROs (real regulatory options) – not in the hands of the project's promoter – that affect the net present value of the project. The inclusion of these mechanisms enriches and improves the valuation methodology of such projects. The comparative analysis of the case study. using other countries. reinforces the idea that the existing RROs depreciate the net present value of renewable generation projects.

1331839,Economic analysis of renewable energy regulation in France: A case study for photovoltaic plants based on real options,2020,José Balibrea-Iniesta,13,Energies,11,2760,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this work. a novel methodology based on the real options theory has been developed for the evaluation of photovoltaic energy projects with a capacity greater than 100 KW in France. French legislation that regulates these types of projects presents two real options: on the one hand. the producer has a put option that consists of choosing between a Feed-in Tariff system and electricity market sale prices every year. and this put option coincides with public subsidies granted by the French Administration. On the other hand. the French Administration has a call option that provides a benefit to the public sector. This option supposes a limit on the subsidized production of electricity and reduces the value of the project to the promoter. The value of the put option is 4.28€ per MWh generated. The Extended Net Present Value has a value of− 5.26 million Euros. The breakeven point of the project is achieved with an increase of 59% in the regulated rate. This means that the French Administration must increase the value of public subsidies if it wants to develop large-scale projects.

The regulatory framework has played a key role in this process. particularly the 661/2007 Royal Decree of May 25. The legislation grants certain rights to promoters. These rights can be characterized as options. allowing us to utilize a significant number of theoretical and empirical studies in the field of financial option pricing in our analysis. Insofar as these derivative assets have underlying real and non-financial assets (ie. a wind farm). the rights provided for in Royal Decree 661/2007 can be considered real options.

Due to the challenging nature of electricity prices. which includes high volatility. sharp price spikes and seasonality. various types of electricity price forecasting models still compete and cannot outperform each other consistently. Neural Networks have been successfully used in machine learning problems and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proposed to address time-dependent learning problems. In particular. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) are tailor-made for time series price estimation. In this paper. we propose to use multi-layer Gated Recurrent Units as a new technique for electricity price forecasting. We have trained a variety of algorithms with three-year rolling window and compared the results with the RNNs. In our experiments. three-layered GRUs outperformed all other neural network structures and state-of-the-art statistical techniques in a statistically significant manner in the Turkish day-ahead market.

The recurrent neural networks methods outperform the classical methods. Furthermore. gated recurrent unit network architecture achieves the best results with a mean absolute error of 0.978 and a root mean square error of 1.302.

Inaccurate electricity price forecasts could cause important loss of profits to the suppliers. In this paper. the financial effect of inaccurate electricity price forecasts on a hydro-based GenCo is examined. Electricity price forecasts of five individual and four hybrid forecast models and the ex-post actual prices are used to schedule the hydro-based GenCo using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). The financial effect measures of profit loss. Economic Loss Index (ELI) and Price Forecast Disadvantage Index (PFDI). as well as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the models are used for comparison of the data from 24 weeks of the year.

1331857,Transfer Learning for Electricity Price Forecasting,2020,Salih Gunduz and Umut Ugurlu and Ilkay Oksuz,,arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.03762,,,,Electricity price forecasting is an essential task for all the deregulated markets of the world. The accurate prediction of the day-ahead electricity prices is an active research field and available data from various markets can be used as an input for forecasting. A collection of models have been proposed for this task. but the fundamental question on how to use the available big data is often neglected. In this paper. we propose to use transfer learning as a tool for utilizing information from other electricity price markets for forecasting.

The performance of the application is additionally measured with an out-of-sample back-testing analysis. which indicates a contribution to the existing literature; second order stochastic dominance preelimination method increases the success of some of the selected mean-variance optimized portfolios on the efficient frontier which stand out with a better back-testing performance.,True,gdqHK-QAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,1,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&profile=ehost&scope=site&authtype=crawler&jrnl=00151920&AN=139303848&h=dA%2BH6Co%2FD%2FWSCFs0dI1biXresxPsDCCh8Z8CJCHEqMm16VVx%2BVR4AnPJvLpKr6KdupVAx1sH%2FSslRYMPK0eoiQ%3D%3D&crl=c,12908708924570718238,/scholar?cites=12908708924570718238,,,,0,0,0
1331859,Basic Time Series Patterns of Turkish Electricity Prices,2016,Umut Ugurlu and Burc Ulengin and Oktay Tas,,The 2016 WEI International Academic Conference Proceddings,,176-194,,After the deliberalization of the Turkish electricity market in the end of 2000s. hourly electricity prices has started to occur in the day-ahead electricity market according to the bids of the supply and demand sides. It is important for both parties to forecast hourly electricity prices to give accurate bids and avoid a lose of money in this market due to myopic forecasts. Therefore electricity price forecasts with different methods. such as time series statistical ones. have been done for Turkish market as well as the more developed electricity markets. Due to the nature of the electricity. electricity prices have some characteristics such as seasonality. high volatility. sharp price spikes and mean reverting processes. This paper mainly focuses on the seasonality effect. Electricity prices show a great variation according to the hours. days of the month. weekdays. months. years and holidays. The first purpose of this paper is to state this fact and give some descriptive information about the electricity prices. Second aim is to eliminate the deterministic seasonality by using a Uni-ANOVA process as a prewhitening method. Our findings suggest that Uni-ANOVA process eliminates the deterministic seasonality substantially. however stochastic seasonality has still effect on the electricity price data.,True,gdqHK-QAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,1,https://www.westeastinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Umut-Ugurlu-Burc-Ulengin-Oktay-Tas.pdf,9045234055094200104,/scholar?cites=9045234055094200104,,,https://www.westeastinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Umut-Ugurlu-Burc-Ulengin-Oktay-Tas.pdf,0,0,0

1331865,Essays on electricity price modeling and forecasting,2019,Umut Uğurlu,,,,,,Electricity markets have been privatized since the beginning of 2000s. Due to this liberalization. electricity price forecasting has become an essential task for all the participants of the electricity markets. Especially day-ahead electricity price forecasts are used for many purposes. For example. generation companies can optimize their production schedule according to these electricity price forecasts and decrease the loss of profits caused by the inaccurate electricity price forecasts. Turkish electricity market is not exempt from this change all over the world. As an emerging market. Turkish day-ahead electricity market needs to be investigated. This thesis consists of three essays on electricity price modeling and forecasting. First one suggests the usage of factorial ANOVA as a pre-treatment to the Turkish electricity price series before applying the forecast methods. Furthermore. it compares the statistical time series methods by using the lagged price series. Even though best performing methods vary from period to period. SARIMA is chosen as the best method among the statistical models. which include Markov regime-switching. SETAR. AR(24) and naïve method. In the second article. electricity prices are forecasted by various models. In addition to the lagged prices; temperature. forecast demand/supply. 24th lag of realized demand/supply and the 24th lag of the balancing market prices are utilized as the exogenous variables.

Performance of the adsorption systems mainly depends on adsorption equilibrium. adsorption kinetics. isosteric heat of adsorption. and thermo-physical/chemical properties of assorted adsorbent-refrigerant pairs. Thereby. the present study aims to review and compare the physical properties (surface area. pore volume/size etc.) of adsorbents and adsorption equilibrium (adsorption isotherm) by various types of adsorbent-adsorbate pairs available in the literature.

1331877,Investigating Applicability of Evaporative Cooling Systems for Thermal Comfort of Poultry Birds in Pakistan,2020,Hafiz MU Raza and Hadeed Ashraf and Khawar Shahzad and Muhammad Sultan and Takahiko Miyazaki and Muhammad Usman and Redmond R Shamshiri and Yuguang Zhou and Riaz Ahmad,10,Applied Sciences,13,4445,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In the 21st century. the poultry sector is a vital concern for the developing economies including Pakistan. The summer conditions of the city of Multan (Pakistan) are not comfortable for poultry birds. Conventionally. swamp coolers are used in the poultry sheds/houses of the city. which are not efficient enough. whereas compressor-based systems are not economical. Therefore. this study is aimed to explore a low-cost air-conditioning (AC) option from the viewpoint of heat stress in poultry birds. In this regard. the study investigates the applicability of three evaporative cooling (EC) options. ie. direct EC (DEC). indirect EC (IEC). and Maisotsenko-cycle EC (MEC). Performance of the EC systems is investigated using wet-bulb effectiveness (WBE) for the climatic conditions of Multan. Heat stress is investigated as a function of poultry weight. Thermal comfort of the poultry birds is calculated in terms of temperature-humidity index (THI) corresponding to the ambient and output conditions. The heat production from the poultry birds is calculated using the Pederson model (available in the literature) at various temperatures. The results indicate a maximum temperature gradient of 10.2 C (MEC system). 9 C (DEC system). and 6.5 C (IEC systems) is achieved. However. in the monsoon/rainfall season. the performance of the EC systems is significantly reduced due to higher relative humidity in ambient air.

Almost half of the world’s population depends on biomass fuels to meet their basic energy requirements for cooking. lighting and space heating. When fuel is badly combusted in poorly designed stoves. the fuel-stove combination results in high level of noxious emissions entering the home. accumulating to dangerous levels. In this study. a Chinese unvented top lit updraft (TLUD) biomass stove was operated with three different biomass pellets formed from corn stover. cotton stalk and peanut shells. The performance tests were conducted according to the latest standard from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. The calorific value. moisture level. volatile matter and elemental composition are reported for each. The thermal efficiencies of the stove were 15.3%. 10.1% and 14.4%. respectively. The cooking powers were 2.68 kW. 1.61 kW and 1.57 kW. The exhaust was collected using a hood and tunnel. The CO. NO and NOX were drawn after passing 1.5 m along the tunnel and the Particulate Matter (PM) was sampled after 1.6 m. The Emission Factors (EF) for CO. NO. NOX and PM10 are reported on both a mass per unit energy delivered to the pot (g/MJNET) and a mass per mass of fuel basis (g/kg).

This study reports the impacts of two fuel feeding methods – front-loading and top-loading on the thermal and emissions performance of a modern coal-fired water-heating and cooking stove using a contextual test sequence that replicates typical patterns of domestic use. Known as a low-pressure boiler. when this stove was fueled with raw coal. the findings indicate that front-loading the fuel. which devolatilizes the new fuel gradually. produced consistently higher space heating efficiency and lower emission factors than top-loading the same stove. which devolatilizes new fuel all at once. Comparing the performance at both high and low power gave the similar results: front-loading with raw coal produced consistently better results than top-loading. The average water heating efficiency when front-loading was (58.6±2.3)% and (53.4±1.8)% for top-loading. Over the sixteen-hour test sequence. front-loading produced 22% lower emissions of PM2.5 (3.9±0.6) mg/MJNET than top-loading (4.7±0.9) mg/MJNET. The same pattern was observed for carbon monoxide and the CO/CO2 ratio. CO was reduced from (5.0±0.4) g/MJNET to (4.1±0.5) g/MJNET. The combustion efficiency (CO/CO2 ratio) improved from (8.2±0.8)% to (6.6±0.6)%. Briquetted semi-coked coal briquettes are promoted as a raw coal substitute. and the tests were replicated using this fuel. Again. the same pattern of improved performance was observed.

Here I show that even more fundamental traits associated with human cognition such as' self-awareness' can easily be demonstrated to be arising out of merely a selection for'better regulators'; ie systems which respond comparatively better to threats to their existence which are internal to themselves. A simple model demonstrates how indeed the average self-awareness for a universe of systems continues to rise as less self-aware systems are eliminated. The model also demonstrates however that the maximum attainable self-awareness for any system is limited by the plasticity and energy availability for that typology of systems.

1331897,Coupled asymmetrically,2020,Fouad Khan,5,Nature Energy,3,185-185,Nature Publishing Group,Energy consumption in a country generally grows with gross domestic product (GDP) or incomes. However. economists have also noted some elasticity in this relationship. that is. in the long run not all change in income leads to a proportional change in energy consumption. To estimate this elasticity. economists generally assume that both increases and decreases in incomes affect energy consumption similarly. Now. Brantley Liddle at the National University of Singapore and Perry Sadorsky at York University. Canada. show that there is asymmetry in how GDP affects energy consumption. with a decrease in GDP reducing consumption by almost as much as twice the increase that would result from an increase in GDP of the same magnitude.

Bringing down the level of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere when extracting and processing these kind of resources has been main driver for the development of fossil resources substitutes and for the adoption of strategies to promote their efficient use. To increase business competitiveness. to optimize the supply chain. and to increment product quality. decision-makers of the horticulture segment face the problem to choose between fossil-based resources and their substitutes. This dissertation presents an Operations Research model. developed for decision-making support in horticulture. The model determines optimal mixture of growth substrate (composed by peat and olive-mill waste compost) and optimal material of planter container (made of petroleum-based plastic or biodegradable. biopolymer). such that additional costs when substituting and environmental impacts of a potted plant are simultaneously minimized. The optimization model is applied to a case study in Italy. Here. greenhouse gases emitted by organic compounds are detected with experimental trials. the agronomic quality of potted plants is investigated. Life Cycle Assessment is performed. and decision-relevant costs are examined. The bi-objective problem is addressed using Pareto optimization.

1331918,Institut für Numerische und Angewandte Mathematik,2018,C Krüger and F Castellani and J Geldermann and A Schöbel,,,,,,Robust multiobjective optimization is used to solve an uncertain biobjective mixing problem arising in the commercial cultivation of potted plants. The so-called peat-andpots problem is to search a mixture of two types of growth substrate and a planter pot such that two objectives. one economic and one ecological. are minimized. The economic objective function is the sum of a linear function and a piecewise constant function while the ecological objective function is linear. In practice. the problem is affected by two types of uncertainty. parameter and decision uncertainty. Parameter uncertainty means that the problem data varies within a fixed set. eg. the emissions of the growth substrate are known to fall in a certain interval. Decision uncertainty means that solutions can not be implemented exactly as targeted. eg. the mixing of growth substrate is performed roughly which leads to different mixtures in different pots. The peat-and-pots problem is considered first as a deterministic problem and the deterministic efficient solutions are determined. Second. the two types of uncertainty are taken into account and the problem is addressed by means of robust multiobjective optimization. Analytical descriptions of the set of solutions to the deterministic and to the uncertain problem are given. The deterministic and robust solution approaches are then extended to further cases of biobjective problems with one objective function being the sum of a linear and a piecewise constant function and the second objective function being linear.,True,lxZoTAMAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,0,http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/preprints/files/2018-5.pdf,,,,,http://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/preprints/files/2018-5.pdf,0,0,0

Agriculture as the basis for economic growth in the agriculture-based countries requires a productivity revolution. This has been depicted in the 5th Economic. Cultural and Social Development Program in Iran by emphasizing on the food security based on in-country production from strategic crops particularly wheat. In addition to increasing wheat grain yield. a suitable model of food supply and consumption for the 1400 vision (2020 vision) is suggested to overcome the inefficiency of the existing model. Population increase and limitations in development of wheat growing areas in Iran have led to this conclusion that increase in grain yield is the focal point and a practicable strategy for production of sufficient wheat grain to meet the requirements of the country. To achieve this goal it is necessary to carefully determine all limiting factors and constraints that hinder the promotion of wheat grain yield and production and to develop suitable research and executive approaches to overcome these constraints. Published information by the Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture shows that the average wheat harvested areas in Iran during 1990-2005 was 6.3 million hectares. The average harvested areas of irrigated wheat during this period was 2.3 million hectares. However. in 1998 it approached 2.5 million hectares and in 2000 due mainly to severe drought it declined to 2.1 million hectares.

Theses greenhouses from aspects of construction and other used systems completely were the same and just in planting management were different. To conduct the research at first. questionnaire forms were designed. Some main questions in the questionnaire forms were such as. area of greenhouse. type and rate of fertilizer and chemical materials. number of used worker. value of water consumption. construction parameters of greenhouse and type and using time from machines. Then. these questionnaire forms were filled and thus. requirement information were obtained to calculate consumption energy and determination of energy indices. Obtained results indicated that average values of energy consumption (input energy) to produce one kilogram tomato greenhouse was 0.8081 Mj. Values of energy productivity. net energy gain and energy ratio were respectively 1.327 kg/Mj.-1225.426 Mj/ha and 0.989. The obtained values of energy indices were showed that energy efficiency is low at studied greenhouses in Kermanshah province. However. since prices of energy factors are low and price of produced tomato is expensive thus. cultivation and production of greenhouse tomato is still economic in Kermanshah province.,True,6oANNNYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,1,https://www.sid.ir/en/journal/ViewPaper.aspx?id=281731,6770520560855486776,/scholar?cites=6770520560855486776,,,,0,0,0

Moreover. the discharge and the water level trends for the Akosombo reservoir from 1965–2014 were examined using the Mann-Kendall test statistic to assess localised changes. The annual temperature trend was positive while rainfall showed both negative and positive trends in different parts of the country. However. these trends were not statistically significant in the study regions in 1960 to 2011. Rainfall was not evenly distributed throughout the years. with the highest rainfall recorded between 1960 and 1970 and the lowest rainfalls between 2000 and 2011. The Mann-Kendall test shows an upward trend for the discharge of the Akosombo reservoir and a downward trend for the water level. However. the discharge irregularities of the reservoir do not necessarily affect the energy generated from the Akosombo plant. but rather the regular low flow of water into the reservoir affected power generation. This is the major concern for the operations of the Akosombo hydropower plant for energy generation in Ghana.

The sector has been confronted with a lot of challenges such as effects of climate change in a harsher regional climate. lack of access to capital. social and environmental issues among others. Other challenges at the core of the hydropower sector include infrastructure. operation and maintenance. life cycle of plants. and extreme events. This chapter enumerates a set of proposed working solutions to these stated challenges in the hydropower sector in West Africa. The use of multipurpose reservoirs as an effective solution to the water-energy nexus is discussed. Synergies with emerging renewable energy technologies and the use of condition-based monitoring systems to extend the life of hydropower facilities are also tackled.,True,8jpprl4AAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC,1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128130162000137,13699046767663042513,/scholar?cites=13699046767663042513,,,,0,0,0

The Future of Sustainability in a Post COVID-19 World,2021,Nicola De Blasio and Phoebe Fallon,,,,,,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is upending our lives and the global economy in ways unimaginable until recently. While the overall impacts are still difficult to quantify. ramifications are sure to be felt for decades to come. Providing secure. reliable. and affordable resources for all without causing devastating environmental consequences is perhaps the greatest challenge of the 21st century. But the pandemic has significantly altered dynamics and changed priorities. How is this impacting the quest for sustainability?In this paper we analyze these challenges by focusing on the plastic industry. There is no doubt that plastic has molded society in many ways that make our lives easier and safer. but it has also created a global environmental and sustainability crisis. In order to curb our addiction to plastic. the world had been waging a war against virgin plastic. but the pandemic has turned an enemy into a much-needed ally. How can we leverage the advantages of plastic without contributing to the world’s environmental crisis? This dilemma poses a significant challenge. but also opens an opportunity to address sustainability at a systemic level through circularity and the transition to low-carbon alternatives to petroleumbased plastics.,True,9OBpaCwAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/PlasticPandemic/PlasticPandemic.pdf,,,,,https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/PlasticPandemic/PlasticPandemic.pdf,0,0,0

Furthermore. they require immense flat land areas to be set-up. The SolaROI project seeks to reduce manufacturing. installation. and maintenance costs with a new design for the troughs that is based on using automotive and aircraft industry type manufacturing methods applied to a simplified trough structure and kinematics. Fundamentally we use the shape of the reflective surface itself as a major part of the structure. as opposed to having a separate structure to hold the reflective elements. Precision parabolic ribs are formed and then the flat reflective panels are attached As shown in Figure 1. Verifying Saint-Venant’s principle. we found the required precision of the parabola is obtained when the ribs are less than 3 panel widths apart. In large scale application. 12m long segments would be driven individually and rotate about the collector tube so the trough overall can follow the contour of the land which saves installation costs and the environment underneath the troughs. Tests on a 4m long prototype module with 5.77 m aperture indicate that it works as well as current troughs. but is significantly less costly to build and install.,True,9OBpaCwAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicola_De_Blasio/publication/337150676_Design_Fabrication_and_Testing_of_a_Modular_Concentrated_Solar_Power_Trough_System/links/5dc79740a6fdcc575038652f/Design-Fabrication-and-Testing-of-a-Modular-Concentrated-Solar-Power-Trough-System.pdf,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicola_De_Blasio/publication/337150676_Design_Fabrication_and_Testing_of_a_Modular_Concentrated_Solar_Power_Trough_System/links/5dc79740a6fdcc575038652f/Design-Fabrication-and-Testing-of-a-Modular-Concentrated-Solar-Power-Trough-System.pdf,0,0,0

Artificial cleaning is required to maintain acceptable values of optical efficiency. especially in those areas where CSP tends to be economically viable. i.e. where the yearly available DNI is high and rain is scarce. The optimization of the cleaning activities is then a fundamental step to properly balance the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of the plant with the revenue losses due to soiled heliostats.

One class is the collection of all electric field waves which are free from magnetic fields. Another class is the collection of all magnetic field waves which are free from electric fields. The wavelengths of electric field waves are less than a constant b. and the wavelengths of magnetic field waves are greater than the constant b. The existence of this constant b is justified in this article by observing an interrelation between two well known expressions for electrostatic forces and magnetic forces. A method to estimate this constant b is proposed based on mathematical derivations and based on the values for mass of an electron. speed of light in vacuum.

This work seeks to understand these plants applied to the Brazilian case. which has in the alcohol-sugar sector a large number of lignocellulose material (sugar-cane bagasse) produced in large scale as a residue of the process of sugar and alcohol production. In this case. technological routes that are able to use this product as a basic feedstock for the industrial process will be described. Therefore. a model based on a set of economical and technological variables is applied to the routes. In this model. different profiles of bio refinery plants are described and compared with different hypothetical regions. which are characterized by a combination of both access to different amounts of raw material and different types of consumers. Overall. this work describes a model of both location and competition of the main bio refinery technological routes in Brazil that have the sugar-cane bagasse as the basic raw material.

Existing approaches for determining optimal strategies are based on real options theory. that often simplify the uncertainty process. or on stochastic programming approaches. that simplify the dynamic aspects. In this paper. we bridge the gap between these approaches by developing a multistage stochastic programming approach that includes real options such as postponing. hedging with fixed (forward) contracts and combination with other sources.

Available at http://welington. athost. net/pdfs/ELBM. pdf,We propose level bundle methods for solving mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with convex objective and constraint functions. Similarly to the extended cutting-plane method of Westerlund and Pettersson (1995). the proposed level bundle variants require solving a mixed-integer linear programming problem–MIP–at each iteration. In contrast. a regularization term is employed in the MIP to avoid tailing-off effect that makes calculations unstable as the iteration process progresses. Distinct regularization terms define different level bundle variants. In all variants. some linearizations representing the cutting-plane model can be dropped after certain critical iterations. reducing the MIP’s size. An encouraging numerical example comparing the new proposals with the extended cutting-plane method is given.,True,-RcwzhYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14946896227037730266&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,,0,0,0

1332142,The geoeconomics of Russian-EU gas trade: drawing lessons from the South Stream pipeline project,2015,Antto Vihma and Umut Turksen,14,"MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, working paper",,,,Energy trade has developed into one of the most contentious and divisive issues between Russia and EU in the post-Cold War era. It reflects a broader geoeconomic struggle in which economic means are used to advocate geopolitical goals. This Working Paper argues that the case of the South Stream Pipeline Project (SSPP)–a grand project abruptly cancelled by President Putin in December 2014–epitomizes these broader power politics involved in the energy relations between the two powers. In 2014 the Russian leadership advanced both traditional geopolitical and contemporary geoeconomic strategies. pursuing the former by conducting a military campaign in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. and utilizing the latter by pushing the construction of South Stream in spite of the EU’s legal and political objections. The EU was able to harden its line on SSPP. The global energy context. including cheap coal prices. expansion of renewable energies. more liquefied natural gas and spot trading. cannot fully account for the assertiveness of the EU Commission and the allegiance of Member States in the SSPP case. The results of the process tracing conducted in this Working Paper confirm that in the case of the SSPP. Russian traditional geopolitics greatly hindered its geoeconomic power towards the EU.

1332144,Counter-terrorist Financing Law and Policy: An Analysis of Turkey,2019,Burke Uğur Başaranel and Umut Türkşen,,,,,Routledge,Since the 9/11 attacks the world has witnessed the creation of both domestic and international legal instruments designed to disrupt and interdict the financial activities of terrorists. This book analyses the counter-terrorist financing law (CTF). policy and practice at the national level. focusing on Turkey. The work examines the limits and capabilities of CTF efforts on terrorism threats and determines the effectiveness of CTF efforts in Turkey. a country which has a pivotal role in terms of countering terrorism regionally and internationally. The Turkish case-study is supported by an empirical study involving 37 semi-structured interviews with CTF practitioners and law enforcement experts with different affiliations and backgrounds. The findings illustrate that Turkey’s CTF system has not obtained an adequate level of effectiveness as a result of lack of proper implementation of its policy in the bureaucratic. legal and operational spheres. It is evident that the administrative and legal systems in Turkey are established according to the ‘one-size-fits-all’international CTF standards and thus are compliant with the international CTF benchmarks. yet the interviews reveal significant challenges at the implementation level including lack of training and financial security. heavy handed bureaucracy. inadequate coordination and communication between international and national levels.

This time-series energy analysis techniques provided much more information than the traditional energy consumption technique. Data is presented for one pumping station that identifies potential electricity savings through modifications to the current pumping regime. Bivariate analysis. followed by CUSUM technique can help improve the cost effectiveness of the energy audit by analysing the data for the pumping stations prior to the audit.

For example. in the city of Leicester in the UK. local strategies and measures have been implemented over several years to improve the energy efficiency of the Council’s own operations and to manage city-wide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Recently. Leicester has participated in a European Commission funded project. which explores the potential for European local authorities and agencies to use their experience to work with a local area in a developing country where energy demand has been increasing rapidly. addressing climate change and sustainable development issues. The project has aimed to provide support at the local level with developing a framework to minimise energy-related contributions to climate change and air pollution. while giving quality of life benefits. It has used a partnership approach between Leicester. Vila Nova de Gaia municipality in Portugal. and a city in the Gujarat. India. The local level’s role in each country in local energy management has been investigated. This has included a baseline assessment of local energy use. renewable energy and climate change issues in each partner city.

Gossypol is a polypehnolic compound stored in the pigment glands of cotton (Gossypium spp.). Diameter of glands varies from 0.01 mm to 0.04 mm. Gossypol concentration of the seed varies from 0.0% to 9.0% but most commercial cotton varieties usually contain the compound from 0.6% to 2.0%. Since this compound is very toxic to humans and monogastric animals. its rate in all food and feed products produced with cotton flour must be very low.

Current finance flows fall short of global financing needs. and massive scaling up is needed to unlock additional financial resources and foster a sustainable investment pathway. Overcoming barriers to private sector investments is critical. and international climate finance can play a catalytic role in this regard. National development banks (NDBs) have a unique role in this context. both complementing and catalyzing private sector players. NDBs have a privileged position in their local markets. strong knowledge of and long-standing relationships with the local private sector. a good understanding of local barriers to investment. and opportunities and vast experience in long-term investment financing. This paper discusses the unique role that NDBs could play in scaling up private financing for climate change mitigation projects through the intermediation of international and national public climate finance in their respective local credit markets and the conditions that would be needed for them to be most effective.

MD may be applied to aqueous systems at concentrations up to and exceeding saturation of both sparingly soluble salts and soluble salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl). leading to potential application in high-recovery desalination processes that approach Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) operation. or as a concentration strategy for mineral recovery. Scaling and fouling is a significant risk for such processes. and knowledge of the effects of these phenomena on performance is essential to the evaluation of MD as a viable technology for these applications.

Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermally-driven membrane desalination processes that utilizes a difference in vapor pressure across a microporous. hydrophobic membrane as the driving force. Thus. it is not limited by differences in the osmotic pressure between the feed and permeate and is tolerant of much higher salinity than RO. Nevertheless. MD still suffers from problems associated with membrane fouling. which is one of the major challenges that hinder its commercialization.  The overall objective of this dissertation is to elucidate scaling and fouling behavior in MD by various inorganic contaminants relevant to inland brackish desalination. which typically must achieve high water recovery to minimize brine disposal costs. Water flux. thermal efficiency. and rejection were experimentally measured in laboratory experiments using real and synthetic solutions supersaturated with respect to soluble salts. sparingly soluble salts. and silica. Various mitigation and cleaning strategies were tested. and the long-term effects of scaling on MD performance were evaluated by performing repeated experiments on previously-fouled membranes using new solutions.  Impacts and control of silica scaling was emphasized because it is ubiquitous in natural water supplies and is of particular concern in brackish desalination. Cleaning of MD membranes scaled by silica was impractical. but several mitigation strategies were effective at …,True,9LMxXGgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://mountainscholar.org/handle/11124/172325,,,,,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/11124/172325/Bush_mines_0052E_11497.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

At temperatures under 150 C. power generation is currently not cost effective. Membrane distillation (MD) can desalinate water at temperatures as low as 50 C and thus may enable production of clean water from low grade heat provided by these abandoned wells. Moreover. if the distillate can be used in evaporative cooling of air-cooled geothermal plants. the efficiency and thus revenue of these plants can be substantially augmented. This narrative motivated the geothermal office of US Department of Energy (DOE) to fund a collaborative research between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) to map the potential application of geothermal MD deslination in the US and design. build. and test a pilot-scale MD unit at two major geothermal power plants in California and Nevada. In the first phase of the project we are selecting most suitable MD membranes. The performance of 15 different MD membranes from 6 different manufacturers was analysed over a wide temperature range (40-70 C). Most of these manufacturers don’t make dedicated MD membranes. but make microfiltration membranes for water and air purification with the adequate pore size and hydrophobicity for MD.

However. desalination of inland brackish resources is often also limited by high potential for scaling by silica and other minerals. The presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium are a complicating factor. as these can catalyze silica polymerization and accelerate membrane fouling. In this study. the influence of cation concentration. carbonate alkalinity. and pH on silica scaling behavior of MD membranes was investigated. Both calcium and magnesium were found to accelerate silica scaling rates. but did not incorporate into the scale layer or alter its impact on water flux and thermal efficiency. The effect of calcium was reduced with increased alkalinity. possibly due to calcium carbonate precipitation in the system or due to interactions between calcium and bicarbonate that reduced the catalytic effect of calcium on silica polymerization. Reducing the feed temperature dramatically reduced both the rate and severity of impacts caused by silica scaling. and optimization of feed temperature may be a promising strategy to minimize silica scaling while maintaining thermal efficiency in MD.,True,9LMxXGgAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/11124/172325/Bush_mines_0052E_11497.pdf?sequence=1#page=94,,,,,https://mountainscholar.org/bitstream/handle/11124/172325/Bush_mines_0052E_11497.pdf?sequence=1#page=94,0,0,0

This technique is applied to study the effect of the atomic arrangement and composition on e33 piezoelectric coefficients of hexagonal ordered and disordered Sc1−xGaxN alloys. Our results on ordered structures are in excellent agreement with local density approximation (LDA) first-principles calculations.

Biostruct,,589-593,,Boron doped nanodiamond (BDD) are well known structures and attracted by many researchers for their application in bio-sensing. electronics. water purification electrodes. unipolar devices. ultraviolet light generators and electrochemical applications [1-4]. BDD are a unique material because of its outstanding mechanical. thermal. optical. electronic and electrochemical properties [5. 6]. The BDD film can be prepared using different techniques as mentioned in the literatures such as; the microwave plasma enhanced-chemical vapor deposition (MW PE-CVD)[7] and Hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HF-CVD)[8] as this method involves activation of a mixture of hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases.The motivation of using BDD in application refers to the conductivity of diamond thin films. where the conductivity can be adjusted typically by carrying out suitable doping procedures. The conductivity of diamond thin films can be fabricated by substitution doping atoms such as B. Al. N. P. S. Si. Ni. Fe. Sb. Cr. etc. As mentioned in the literature. boron is one of the most used and successful because of its ability to be substituted for carbon atoms in the diamond lattice [9]. BDD thin films are synthesized by substituting some of the hybridized carbon atoms in the diamond lattice with boron atoms during diamond thin film synthesis (In situ) or after diamond thin film synthesis (Ex situ). In situ doping involves addition of certain amount of boron containing gas species to the diamond forming gas mixtures during the diamond thin film __________________________________,True,iuKZPy0AAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,5,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nabil_Ayoub/publication/316916119_Effect_of_Boron_Concentration_on_Nano-Crytalline_Diamond_Deposited_on_Niobium_Substrates/links/594bb103458515077c70ec94/Effect-of-Boron-Concentration-on-Nano-Crytalline-Diamond-Deposited-on-Niobium-Substrates.pdf,13625999445772412221,/scholar?cites=13625999445772412221,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nabil_Ayoub/publication/316916119_Effect_of_Boron_Concentration_on_Nano-Crytalline_Diamond_Deposited_on_Niobium_Substrates/links/594bb103458515077c70ec94/Effect-of-Boron-Concentration-on-Nano-Crytalline-Diamond-Deposited-on-Niobium-Substrates.pdf,0,0,0

The transform explains the fact that every signal or waveform. whether electrical or mechanical. is composed of many sinusoids of different frequencies each having a different weight. This abstract notion of the Fourier transform goes unnoticed or misunderstood by many engineering students. In this work. we design a simple GUI tool using MATLAB. which records a sound sample and shows its frequency spectrum. The spectrum of the human voice shows how different its frequency content might be for different individuals. In addition. we use a function generator mobile app to generate different signals and sounds to show their frequency content and enforce the concept of Fourier transform to engineering majoring students as early as their first year in introductory physics classes. This tool is interactive. intuitive and easy to use and can help students develop a conceptually sound basis of the Fourier transform.

Also. it is vital in design of machine mechanism and optimization of welding process parameters. In this study. a friction stir welded butt joint on AA7075-T651 aluminum alloy plate is investigated. With change of some parameters. factors including axial force. mechanical properties. microhardness and weld morphology. are studied. For measuring the axial force. load cell was utilized and a servohydraulic machine was applied to evaluate the mechanical properties. The results show that by increasing the welding speed and in the same rotational rate. the axial force and microhardness increase but the weld appearance quality decreases. However. by increasing the rotational rate in the same welding speed. there is not any certain relationship among the axial force. hardness and weld morphology. Also. by changing the tool tilt angle from zero to 2.5 degrees. the weld morphological feature is enhanced.

Alternative energy systems have been gained importance in terms of sustainable energy management. The electrically driven systems have made us think of this point once more. Using waste and/or renewable energy instead of electricity can be considered as driving source once their integration to a system is conceivable. Absorption refrigeration is a technique used for cooling applications satisfying all those considerations as much as possible. However. its thermodynamic performance plays an important role from many respects. This study focuses on the performance improvement of a series flow double effect water/lithium bromide absorption cooling system adjusting the equilibrium temperature in the double stage ie. high pressure condenser (HPC)/lower pressure generator (LPG) unit. The results are shown to improve the coefficient of performance (COP) of the system; high operational temperature is required in the HPC for a fixed cooling capacity.

Animal biomass resources were examined under three major groups: bovine. small ruminant. and poultry. Bovine animals were described in terms of three different cattle species. buffalo and other species (horse. donkey. camel. mule and pig). Sheep and goat were considered as two subspecies of small ruminant. Poultry consisted of two different chicken species. turkey. goose and duck. The status of animal biomass in Turkey and its exploitation by use of anaerobic digestion and consequent combustion of methane produced for energy production were presented. A detailed analysis was made to determine which animal species has high energy potential of biomass. The potential of energy. waste and the production depending on every single subspecies were indicated in the analyses. The waste coefficients for species were obtained from the biomass energy potential atlas of Turkey and the animal production data reported by the Turkish Statistical Institute.

Coefficient of performance of this system is higher than those single and double effect absorption refrigeration systems but its system design involves more system components which make the thermodynamic cycle more complex. A basic absorption refrigeration system has only an evaporator. a condenser. an absorber and a generator. Adding heat exchanger/s improves the coefficient of performance. Absorption refrigeration systems do not involve a compressor as compared to vapor compression systems due to absorber and generator. The high-pressure generator is the significant components of an absorption refrigeration system which allows to use solar energy and industrial waste heat as a heat source. In this study. a thermodynamic analysis was performed for a lithium bromide-water series flow triple effect absorption refrigeration system including eight different mass flow lines. The variation in coefficient of performance with mass flow rates in the cycle was investigated thoroughly. It was indicated that mass flow rates of the solutions decrease with increasing temperature of the low-pressure generator and this has resulted in a positive impact on the coefficient of performance. Evaporator temperature has the same effect with low pressure generator on the system but the effect of condenser temperature is vice versa.,True,k8waiJkAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,0,http://www.bcc.bas.bg/bcc_volumes/Volume_50_Special_G_2018/50G_PD_96-101.5.pdf,,,,,http://www.bcc.bas.bg/bcc_volumes/Volume_50_Special_G_2018/50G_PD_96-101.5.pdf,0,0,0

This can be explained by its continuation to be used as a basic input in production process. although the energy resources are limited and dispersed in different areas. Energy will continue to be on the agenda. because energy consumption will rise as a result of world population increase and more industrialization. Energy production. like energy consumption is directly related to economic development of the countries. Studies reveal that there is positive correlation between economic growth and increase in energy demand. One of these studies is Mucuk&Soysal’s “Energy Consumption and Economic Growth in Turkish Economy” which uses Granger’s (1969) causality analyses. Causality test developed by Granger is one of most used techniques in designating the way of the relation between the variables (Granger. 1969). MucukandSoysal’s findings has shown that energy consumption affects growth in positive direction (Mucuk&Soysal. 2006). Turkey providing especially the manufacturers energy sources with low costs by using various incentive policies. has great importance for social welfare. Moreover. the energy demand that will increase with growth. will need the current energy resources to be used actively and efficiently.

By simply altering the substituents of an identical molecular linker. the topology-selective synthesis of two highly crystalline 2D COFs can be readily achieved. Their distinct crystal structures are observed and determined by low-dose. high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging. indicating that the driving force for linkage conformation switching is intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

The standard method for determining the maximum power (P max) of these devices uses the relation P max= U 2/4 R ESR. where U stands for the cell voltage and R ESR for the equivalent series resistance. Despite the relevance of R ESR. one can observe a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the determination of this parameter from the galvanostatic charge-discharge findings. In addition. a literature survey revealed that roughly half of the scientific papers have calculated the R ESR values using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. while the other half used the galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) method. R ESR values extracted from EIS at high frequencies (> 10 kHz) do not depend on the particular equivalent circuit model. However. the conventional GCD method better resembles the real situation of the device operation. and thus its use is of paramount importance for practical purposes. In the latter case. the voltage drop (Δ U) verified at the charge-discharge transition for a given applied current (I) is used in conjunction with Ohm’s law to obtain the R ESR (eg. R ESR= Δ U/Δ I). However. several papers have caused a great confusion in the literature considering only applied current (I). In order to shed light on this important subject. we report in this work a rational analysis regarding the GCD method in order to prove that to obtain reliable R ESR values the voltage drop must be normalized by a factor of two (eg.

O armazenamento de Energia tem se tornado uma missão de extrema relevância para sociedade moderna. principalmente por conta da nossa necessidade de redução de poluentes. da demanda relativa à mobilidade urbana e aos eletrônicos móveis como celulares. computadores. etc. Os dispositivos de maior destaque para estas aplicações são baterias e capacitores eletroquímicos. Estes últimos são sistemas de Potência que permitem carga e descarga muito rápidas e alta longevidade (>> 100 mil ciclos de carga e descarga) devido sua elevada eficiência (~100%) e baixas resistências ôhmicas e. por isso. têm chamado muito a atenção. Por outro lado. comparado com baterias de Lítio-íon recarregáveis. os capacitores eletroquímicos armazenam aproximadamente um trinta avos da densidade de Energia. Por isso. este trabalho é focado em colaborar com o aumento de Energia destes dispositivos mantendo suas características benéficas como. por exemplo. rápido tempo de carga. que pode ser até três ordens de grandeza menor do que baterias de dimensões similares. De fato. estes dispositivos capacitores eletroquímicos têm sido importante objeto de estudos na área da pesquisa e tem o objetivo de atuar como uma tecnologia complementar as baterias com nichos de aplicações específicos.

There is significant bulk flow in a partially filled sphere (1–14 mm/s) of ferrofluid or a finite height cylinder of ferrofluid with no cover (1–4 mm/s) placed in the spherical coil apparatus. The flow is due to free surface effects and the non-uniform magnetic field associated with the shape demagnetizing effects. Flow is also observed in the fully filled ferrofluid sphere (1–20 mm/s) when the field is made non-uniform by adding a permanent magnet or a DC or AC excited small solenoidal coil.

1332369,Ferrofluid spin-up flows from uniform and non-uniform rotating magnetic fields,2010,Shahriar Rohinton Khushrushahi,,,,,,"When ferrofluid in a cylindrical container is subjected to a rotating azimuthally directed magnetic field. the fluid ""spins up"" into an almost rigid-body rotation where ferrofluid nanoparticles have both a linear and an angular ""spin"" velocity. Flow observations are often limited to the ferrofluid free surface due to the opaque nature of the ferrofluid and the surface flow can spin-up in the same or opposite directions to the direction of the rotating field. The mechanisms governing this flow have been attributed to surface driven flows that depend on the shape of the meniscus formed by the free surface. However. bulk flow experiments using ultrasound velocimetry show that even in the presence of a stationary cover. bulk ferrofluid flows would result when a rotating magnetic field was applied. The mechanisms explaining the bulk flows have been attributed by some authors to being a result of spin diffusion theory while others believe that non-uniform magnetic properties drive the flow. with both theories being rigorously explored in this thesis. This thesis applies ferrohydrodynamic analysis to extended fluid flow equations driven by magnetization forces and torques on the ferrofluid. Maxwell's equations relating magnetization. magnetic field and ferrofluid flow. and a Langevin magnetization relaxation constitutive law including the effects of fluid linear and spin velocities.

However. ferrofluid flows in the planar case. having analytical solutions. is usually the stepping stone to understanding flows in more complicated geometries. The reason is that under a uniform magnetic field. the ferrofluid's magnetization depends only on the particle spin velocity and not the fluid velocity. In addition. the uniform magnetic field results in zero magnetization force densities along the duct axis. The case of planar Poiseuille ferrofluid flows in planar ducts. stressed by uniform sinusoidally applied magnetic fields transverse and parallel to the duct axis. has been previously analyzed [6-10] using Mathematica as the software of choice.

1332393,User facilitated real-time inter-operator resource sharing,2011,Ahmet Cihat Toker,,,,,,To benefit from the quickly expanding data traffic volume. the operators must make sure that the increase in traffic does not reduce the Quality of Service (QoS) offered to the users. QoS is expressed in concrete and objective technical parameters such as delay and loss rates. A newer concept. Quality of Experience (QoE) extends QoS with the subjective valuation of the user. how satisfying the service consumption over a certain network is. As the number of users in a network grows. it gets harder to satisfy the requirements of the users. One option is to combine different radio access technologies (RAT). A well-known example is the combination of WLAN Hotspot networks deployed by the network operators with the cellular networks. When one of these networks is congested. a part of the traffic destined for this network can be transferred to the alternative network. Our primary observation that lead to this work was that the limitation that the integrated networks should belong to the same operator is not theoretical or technical. The algorithms in the literature require exchange of operation information among the different radio access networks (RAN) that are managed jointly. These information are number of current users. or the congestion level in the network. This is possible if the RANs belong to the same operator.

Heidelberg,Realtime resource sharing between operators is an efficient approach to deal with the ever increasing wireless traffic. Simple and closed form formulas relating cooperation terms to the network performance measures are needed. so that the operators can take cooperate/not cooperate decisions. and track the benefits/losses of sharing. Analytical solutions to resource sharing the among access networks of a single operator exist. However the fact that operators will not share network internal data calls for solutions that are separable from each other.

1332402,10 Poland’s climate change policy struggle,2010,Karolina Jankowska,,The European Union as a leader in international climate change politics,,163,Taylor & Francis,Because Poland has failed to take on a climate change policy leadership role on any of the domestic. EU and international levels. this chapter will focus on Poland’s attitude towards the adoption and implementation of EU and international climate change policy measures rather than on domestic climate change policies. The first domestic modern-day environmental regulations were adopted in Poland at the beginning of the 1990s. It is to be expected that the EU will play an important role in the formulation of domestic environmental policy because its formulation is taking place in parallel with European integration. However. since the announcement of the EU climate and energy package (see Chapter 1 by Wurzel and Connelly and Chapter 5 by Oberthür and Dupont) Poland is no longer simply a follower of EU policy. Instead it has started to play an active role at European level during the negotiations of the climate and energy package. Although many commentators have stated that Poland had actually been blocking the very ambitious original proposal of the EU climate and energy package. in this chapter it is argued that Poland’s aim has rather been to try to reshape the EU policy in order to make it possible for Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries to attain the ambitious EU targets without suffering huge economic losses. According to Polish state officials such economic losses. would. for example. have resulted from the adoption and implementation of the Commission’s proposal for the revision of the EU emission trading scheme (ETS).,True,Ky8e6VEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,30,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4oZaBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA163&dq=info:LhV6KlZL6iwJ:scholar.google.com&ots=B2-WuJKkQD&sig=Iptq-ME_BBqe0fWCaWTSicpisRY,3236482115671037230,/scholar?cites=3236482115671037230,,,,0,0,0
1332403,Poland’s Clash Over Energy and Climate Policy: Green Economy or Grey Status Quo?,2016,Karolina Jankowska,,,,,Routledge Taylor & Francis Group,With regard to its attitude to (and implementation of) climate change policy measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) at the domestic. EU and international level. Poland has mostly played the role of either policy taker. policy shaper or veto player. This chapter deals with the complex relationship between Poland. the EU and the international community in the field of climate and energy policy. It argues that the most relevant factors for explaining the Polish role in EU and international climate change politics are the importance of the energy sector for Poland’s emissions profile and the dominance of coal in Poland’s energy mix to such an extent that it is an outlier both in Europe and globally (World Bank 2015: 33). Hard coal and lignite constitute 57 per cent of gross inland energy consumption (World Bank 2015: 33) and almost 90 per cent of electricity consumption. The combustion of fossil fuels causes over 75 per cent of GHGE (Szewrański 2012: 10). Overall Poland’s share in GHGE is low and amounts to only 1 per cent (World Bank 2015: 30). However. the share in the total EU GHGE amounts to 8 per cent (Szewrański 2012: 10). Moreover. Poland’s economy remains among the least carbon-efficient in the EU and its energy intensity is almost twice as high as the EU (World Bank 2015: 30; Szewrański 2012: 1). Another explanatory factor is the centralized energy sector structure with the Polish government owning the majority in the biggest energy and fossil fuels companies such as the Polish Energy Group (Polska Grupa Energetyczna–PGE) and Lotos Group.,True,Ky8e6VEAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,25,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=YUQlDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA145&dq=info:_EEZqbauRB0J:scholar.google.com&ots=vlPzYEMuNA&sig=Dq2WwFOl9prQOnS7uE3k5DYF0-o,2109002625060520444,/scholar?cites=2109002625060520444,,,,0,0,0

Poland is well known for its opposition to climate change policy measures aiming at reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. including development of renewable energy sources (RES). Generally. the country is depicted as a foot-dragger with some entrepreneurial skills developed more recently to shape European policy according to its preferences (Jankowska. 2011. Jankowska. 2017). At the domestic level. Poland behaves generally as a laggard when it comes to the implementation of European Union (EU) renewable energy policy. This label applies especially to the electricity sector. where close links between the government and state-owned energy enterprises hinder the development of RES for electricity (RES-E).

1332424,The forces of change. The Polish transition from coal-based manufacturing to renewable oriented society; Die Kraefte des Wandels. Die Wandlung Polens von einer auf Kohle …,2012,Karolina Jankowska,,,,,,The purpose of the present analysis is to expound the policy change observed within the subsystem of renewable energy policy. It is based methodologically on a process and content analysis. analytically on a policy analysis and theoretically on the advocacy coalition approach. the capture theory and the punctuated equilibrium theory. It is found that the policy field under study evolved in four stages. in the course of which the core policy of the government programme changed three times (2nd. 3rd and 4th stage). In the course of the analysis it transpires that all of the protagonists under study were generally in favour of the development of renewable energy resources. The analysis confirms the author's assumption that there were two advocacy coalitions standing in opposition to one another within the subsystem of renewable energy policy in the course of the stages of policy change under study. The main difference between these coalitions lay in the role they postulated for renewable energy resources: The status-quo coalition supported the development of renewable energies so long as this did not appear to threaten the role of fossil energy resources. while the energy turnaround coalition was in favour of an energy turnaround in the course of which renewable resources would take the place of fossil resources.,True,Ky8e6VEAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/biblio/22007975,,,,,,0,0,0

Inc.,In this paper the performance of seasonal heat storage coupled to solar-assisted heat pump in the Jordan region was investigated. The system has been studied by means of a model in which the thermal budget of each component has been described by simplified differential equation. A parametric analysis has provided the yearly energy saving by varying the building heat requirement. the area of collectors. the heat storage size. and insulation for different area.

Jordan,2008,Mohammed Awwad Al-Dabbas,2,Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences,4,1186-1203,,The energy absorbed by solar collector depends upon its angle of tilt. the best way to collect maximum daily energy is to use tracking systems. but they are expensive. need energy for their operation. and are not always applicable. Therefore it is often more practicable to orient the absorber plate at an optimum tilt angle. and to correct the tilt from time to time. for this propose. one should be able to determine the optimum slope of the absorber plate at any latitude. for any surface azimuth angle. and on any day of the year. A computer programmed is constructed on mathematical formulation to find the hourly. daily and monthly average values of optimum tilt angle. optimum orientation and maximum total radiation on the tilted surface of the collector. The daily and monthly average values of optimum tilt angle are calculated. so that the average values of the maximum total radiation will be near to its hourly values.

Depending on the type of problem it may be necessary to take density coupled processes into account. Furthermore. thermal dependence of material properties should be considered. Special problems occur in cases of fracture flow. which can be of high importance with respect to productivity. Finally. the simultaneous modeling of heat and mass transport processes may be necessary. Several simulation codes are available which apply different numerical methods. However. the applicability for complex subsurface geometries reduces the number substantially. We will present modeling approaches with ANSAS.

Faculty of Engineering,Furnaces of steel sheet combustion chamber were designed. constructed and operated to burn oil shale. The constructed combustion chamber was operated satisfactorily for several hours of operation. The experiments were conducted at steady state conditions using different values of air fuel ratios. High combustion efficiencies were achieved at various operating condition. The combustion efficiency was noticed to increase with the increase of air to fuel ratio for each test. Carbon monoxide concentration in flue gas was found to decrease with the increase in air fuel ratio. This was associated with the decrease in oxygen gas and an increase in carbon dioxide. During experimental work chromel-alumel thermocouples were used to measure the temperature distribution within the flame. Exhaust gases were analyzed using (motor scan gas analyzer 8070).

Spindle speed (N). feed rate (f). axial depth of cut (a) and radial depth of cut (r) were cutting parameters chosen as input variables in the investigation of the surface roughness quality. The experimental design adopted for this study was the central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology. Thirty samples were run in a CNC milling machine for each condition and the surface roughness measured using Mitutoyo surface tester. A comparison showing the effects of cutting parameters on the surface roughness for dry and MQL conditions in end-milling of aluminium were evaluated. Surface roughness values for MQL condition were lower with up to 20% reduction when compared to dry conditions. MQL cutting condition was found to be better and more reliable because it is environmentally friendly and gives better surface finish.

K.1 and Okonkwo Ugochukwu C.2 and * and Sinebe Jude E.3,6,International Journal of Mechanics and Applications,3,49-62,Published online at http://journal.sapub.org/mechanics Copyright © 2016 Scientific & Academic Publishing.,Regenerative chatter is an instability phenomenon in machining operation that must be avoided if high accuracy and greater surface finish is to be achieved. It comes with its own consequences such as poor surface finish. low accuracy. excessive noise. tool wear and low material removal rate (MRR). In this paper. an analytical method base on first order least square approximation full-discretization method is use for the stability analysis on the plane of axial depth and radial depths of cut. A detail computational algorithm has been developed for the purpose of delineating stability lobe diagram into stable and unstable regions using mathematical models. These algorithms enabled the performance of sensitivity analysis. From the results axial depth of cut enhances the unstable region and suppresses the stable region. This means that inverse relationship exists between the axial and limiting radial depths of cut thus highlighting the need to determine the maximum value of their product for achieving maximized MRR thereby reducing the chatter in the milling process. It is also seen that the peak radial depths of cut occasioned by the lobbing effects occur at fixed spindle speeds irrespective of the axial depth of cut. Similarly. the rise in spindle speed enhances the stable region and suppresses the unstable region. This means that for us to have chatter-free milling process. parameters like axial and radial depths of cut should be carefully selected together at high machining speed. With these behaviour. one can locate the productive spindle speed at which the lobbing effects occur and depths of cut combination for the operator.

This work considered both optimal active passes and the return idle passes in estimation of minimum machining time. The fully-immersed initiating passes were included in estimation of minimized machining time in this work. Equations are proposed to calculate machining time of both pocketing by horizontal and vertical chronologies. Numerical calculations showed that the latter is much faster in machining a rectangular pocket of arbitrary size. This result validates the theory that vertical chronology is expected to be more time saving than the horizontal chronology due preponderance of bivariate optimization of MRR in terms of axial and radial depths of cut together with the absence of diagonal idle return motions in the vertical chronology as against the horizontal chronology that allows only univariate optimization of MRR in terms of either axial or radial depths of cut. The axial depth of cut and radial immersion 0.005 m and 0.8 respectively are concurrently determined to give global optimal MRR because no other point is seen to have less machining time. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) was used to simulate the optimal pocketing processes and …,True,Nw_USHIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/39764597/Dynamic_Approach_to_Optimization_of_Material_Removal.pdf,2758209194586362749,/scholar?cites=2758209194586362749,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/39764597/Dynamic_Approach_to_Optimization_of_Material_Removal.pdf,0,0,0

This was achieved through the design and implementation of real time vehicle speed monitoring system using cellular signal along the travelled path. A data acquisition device was developed to capture in real time the signal strength and geospatial data (longitude and latitude) along the travel path which is used in determining the speed of the moving vehicle. The acquired data was correlated with data obtained from standardize equipment to establish the integrity of the data. the data was then used to develop the algorithm by obtaining equation for the path-loss gain in terms of signal strength against distance. Equation for the base stations covering a distance of 10km were obtained for analysis. Consequently from the equation. the distance from two locations along the route can be determined from corresponding signal strength values. the average speed results for the drive test. new Model and using Latitude and Longitude are compared as followed 88.05km/hr. 75.67km/hr and 88.2km/hr respectively.

Shops are only able  to  fulfill  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  demand.  The  biggest  obstacle  towards attaining  self-sufficiency  in  the  production  of  plantain  chips  is  the  intensity  of  labor involved  and  the  tediousness  of  the  process  which  often  culminate  into  prolonged production time. Plantain has a large amount of sap and this causes the skin to adhere to the fruit inside. After peeling. they must be sliced into discs to fry into chips. Worker will  hold  up  to  eight  plantains  in  one  hand  and  rapidly  slice  them  using  a  wooden mandolin.  Because  of  the  rapid  pace  at  which  they  slice  plantain  and  the  absence ofhand  gloves  on  the  workers.  accidents  are  very  often  unavoidable.  These  presents health hazards to both the worker. who may develop infections from their injuries. and customers  who  may  consume  an  unsanitary  product.

However. the importance of quantum capacitance in realistic carbon electrodes is not clear. Toward understanding that from a theoretical perspective. here we studied the quantum capacitance and total capacitance of graphene electrodes as a function of the number of graphene layers. The quantum capacitance was obtained from electronic density functional theory based on fixed band approximation with an implicit solvation model. while the EDL capacitances were from classical density functional theory. We found that quantum capacitance plays a dominant role in total capacitance of the single-layer graphene both in aqueous and ionic-liquid electrolytes but the contribution decreases as the number of graphene layers increases.

Based on a coarse-grained model using classical density functional theory. we study the structure. ion partitioning. and selectivity of symmetric and asymmetric ionic liquid mixtures for both zero and non-zero applied potential. At zero applied potential. narrow pores favor adsorption of small anions due to the distribution of asymmetric ions which induce a net surface charge. This further enriches the smaller anions. producing a self-amplified selectivity. We find a similar selectivity for non-zero applied potential. that the small pore is selective to the small anion. For both zero and non-zero potentials. the selectivity decreases as the pore size increases. We developed an idealized model to study the capacitance with respect to changes in electrolyte composition. electrode potential. and pore size. The energy density depends on the ion distribution within the pores of an electrode. The ion layer near the surface of the electrode is always selective to the small counterion. which increases the capacitance appreciably as the thickness of the superficial layer decreases. versus that of the larger counterion from the symmetric ionic liquid. For mesoporous carbons containing an asymmetric ionic liquid. the capacitance is on par with the anomalous capacitance seen for a symmetric ionic liquid in ultranarrow pores.

1332507,Laminar Burning Velocity of Biomass-Derived Fuels and Its Significance in Combustion Devices,2018,Atmadeep Bhattacharya and Amitava Datta,,,,359-378,Springer. Singapore,Biomass is considered to be an alternative and renewable energy resource for the sustainable development in future. The most conventional way of deriving energy from biomass is through direct combustion of the fuel. However. the combustion devices directly burning biomass are highly inefficient and result in emission of significant pollutants. Generation of secondary fuels. called biofuels. from biomass and their utilization in various applications can circumvent these limitations. The second generation biofuels can be derived either in liquid or gaseous forms and can be used in devices like engines and burners. When the fuel is burned with oxidizer as a premixed flame. e.g. in a spark ignition engine or on a premixed burner. the laminar burning velocity plays a major role in the propagation or the stabilization of the flame. The structure of the fuel and its reaction kinetics influence the laminar burning velocity …,True,Tqh_j4YAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-8393-8_16,10887290868570291286,/scholar?cites=10887290868570291286,,,,0,0,0

It uses water as a medium. and is therefore a suitable preparation device for studies on coking coal as other separation techniques may change coking properties. The separation process was conducted by using a channel spacing of 3 mm between two adjacent plates (a deviation from the previous 1.77-mm spacing which promoted laminar flow). The 3-mm channel gap which equated to nominal particle size of coking coal in coke oven charge could lead to a transition from laminar to turbulent flow in the separation process. By changing water flow rate in the separation system. two coals. one coking coal and one thermal coal with particle size of − 210 + 100 μm. were separated into different fractions.

1332550,Mechanisms of Metaplast Formation during Coal Pyrolysis,2017,Quang Anh Tran,,,,,,Coke is a solid carbon residue essential to the production of steel via the blast furnace route due to its ability to act as a high-strength permeable support for the blast furnace charges. The solid coherent coke is produced from coking coal via the high temperature carbonization process. Such coal-to-coke transformation is governed by the coal’s thermoplastic behaviour which includes softening. bubble formation. swelling. and resolidification during pyrolysis. Only coals of a certain rank are able to exhibit thermoplastic development and are termed as coking coals. Non-coking coals. on the other hand. do not soften or melt and are not suitable for coke-making purposes. The thermoplastic development of a coking coal within the plastic range (400-600 C) is attributable to the present of materials either existing in the raw coal (here called the mobile phase and extracted with tetrahydrofuran. THF) or being generated on heating coal (here called the metaplast and also extracted by THF).The physical changes during coking coal pyrolysis are well described and can be examined to empirically determine coal plastic properties by a number of standard tests.

The country׳s proportion of RE production in primary energy and distribution in electricity is significantly higher than those of many Asian and European countries. However. the Philippine National RE Program has adopted a strategy of aggressively amassing RE capacity to the extent of tripling the capacity over the period 2011 to 2030.The preoccupation with more megawatts rather than the value of RE beyond clean energy has erected a bias against off-grid RE applications. Off-grid RE applications can displace more expensive diesel generation and can enhance the livelihood opportunities for communities.

The expectation was that prices would fall due to increased competition and that generators would become more innovative and efficient. However. the enthusiasm for deregulation wavered after events such as the debacle in California. the fall of Enron and the setbacks of Ontario. In the Philippines. comprehensive legislation was passed in 2001 but the implementation has been rather slow and controversial.

But persistent poverty levels in agricultural areas have dissuaded Filipino youth from pursuing opportunities in this sector. In this commentary. we propose that the Philippine government work with private investors and socio-civic organizations to revive interest in agriculture by positioning it as an attractive and viable option. This can be done by stimulating entrepreneurial activities in agriculture. through targeted agricultural entrepreneurship education. Entrepreneurship shifts attention from producing more of the same things to producing value-added goods and services through managed agricultural risks. To encourage opportunity seeking and value creation in this sector. there is need to train current farmers to become more entrepreneurial and to educate future generations to become agricultural entrepreneurs. This commentary presents four current strategies to increase interest in agricultural entrepreneurship in the Philippines—Family Farm Schools. the SAKA program. Farm Business Schools. and the Social Enterprise approach of Gawad Kalinga. Clearly. a more concerted effort among government. socio-civic organizations. and private investors is needed for substantial outcomes to materialize.,True,lTYEInoAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,7,http://foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/359,10952841311482150699,/scholar?cites=10952841311482150699,,,http://foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/download/359/343,0,0,0

Some economists estimated that the opportunity cost borne by the economy was from P 3 to P 5 Billion per day.By 1998. the IPPs had invested approximately US $6 Billion to put up 4. 800 MW of capacity located throughout the economy. Unfortunately. the lingering effects of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 have underscored the inherent weaknesses operating within the power sector.

Today. all nations are facing the effects of uncontrolled development—natural disasters are more frequent and more intense than ever experienced. This has prompted international agencies. governments. and urban planners to rehabilitate cities or build new ones that are more resilient to disaster while promoting sustainable living. The Asian Development Bank (2013) advocated for greater investment in resiliency. For wealthier nations. the transformation is taking place. For developing nations. this is still to be achieved. But what if there is an opportunity to start anew? Tropical storm Haiyan. known locally as Yolanda. hit the central group of islands of the Philippines in November 2013. With winds racing at 315 kilometers per hour (kph). more than 6.000 people were killed despite storm alerts meant to minimize casualties (Office of the President. 2013). Property damage was reported in the billions. as entire cities were wiped out. displacing 1.4 million families (Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. 2014). The far bigger tragedy in the aftermath of the relief efforts is the belief that the city can be rebuilt sans orchestrated planning. In reality. it is almost impossible to prepare adequately for a freak of nature that was Yolanda. Japan. surely one of the most disaster prepared country in the world. was not able to substantially mitigate the Fukushima earthquake in 2011 (Iwata.

1332576,Estimating the social welfare benefits from the privatization and restructuring of the Philippine electricity supply industry.,1998,Fernando Yan Roxas,,,,,,This study estimates the welfare benefits to society as a result of the Privatization and Restructuring (P & R) reforms as applied to the Philippine Electricity Supply Industry (PESI). The strategy and specific reforms to be implemented is based on the policy objectives approved by the National Power Board (NPB) and enunciated as objectives of the proposed draft Omnibus Power Industry Act (House Bill 9991 and Senate Bill 868) pending before both Houses of the 10th Congress. The study assumes that the P & R reforms outlined actually achieve the policy objectives. The study quantifies these benefits. Although the P & R reforms cover the entire range of the PESI. this study is concerned only with the social benefits derived from the competition in the generation sub-sector and that these benefits will not be realized by consumers if there will be no changes nor reforms in the transmission and distribution sub-sectors. To analyze the expected social value of P & R reforms. Michael G. Pollitt's description of cost-benefit approaches is followed. This necessitates the financial simulation of the successor companies (Gencos and Transco) performance over a sufficiently long period of time. The financial model would be on cash basis since the Jones. Tandon and Vogelsang (JTV) Model requires a discounted present value stream of benefits. The cash streams would also be expressed as nominal amounts to include the effects of forecast forex and inflation indices movements. In order to engender competition in the generation end. and ensure that transmission network assets are adequately provided by the successor companies. a DCF financial model that …,True,lTYEInoAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,0,https://animorepository.dlsu.edu.ph/etd_doctoral/837/,,,,,,0,0,0

1332582,Technology transfer of solar ovens in West Nusa Tenggara Province. Indonesia,1995,H Suharta,,,,,,It has been estimated that there are about 7.25 million families in barren areas of Indonesia using equipment which currently uses 5.3 billion kilograms of fuelwood per day. If solar ovens are used for 180 days a year. in a dry season. the yearly fuel wood demand could be reduced by half. This paper describes a field research project which aimed to prove that the solar oven is a practical alternative to current cooking technology. and can help to conserve natural resources. The creation of a nucleus of local people with a practical understanding of solar oven technology through technology transfer programs was the first step in achieving the target. The paper describes the information collected on the knowledge level of participants. social observations during training. interim results. and future activities. The results were mostly good. There was indications that problems may arise with the replacement of broken equipment which will need to be addressed in future trials. Fifty solar ovens have been made and the majority were distributed to the people in Western Lombok. Next year activities will be held in Central Lombok island and Sumbawa island. and more solar ovens will be made. At the same time possible training in other provinces will be investigated.

However. the analysis of the internal factors has received much less attention than the external ones. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the role of resources. competences. and dynamic capabilities (RCCs) as determinants (drivers and barriers) of different eco‐innovation (EI) types. Those EI types contribute differently to the sustainable transition of the economy and society. that is. towards the circular economy. The statistical analyses reveal that RCCs are quite relevant as determinants of EIs. and that different RCCs are more or less relevant for different EI types.

Europe will rely on fluctuating renewable sources. such as solar PV and wind power. to a much larger extent than today. This means that Europe as a whole and each individual country on the continent must increase the availability and use of flexibility options in order to balance the grid. Such flexibility options include dispatchable renewable sources (eg concentrating solar power (CSP) with thermal storage. or dam hydropower). electricity storage. and demand-response.We start from the notion that the future does not happen. but it is made by a series of policy decisions between now and then. If this is true. then the electricity system of 2050 is determined by the sum of all policy decisions affecting the power system–the policy pathway–in all legislations in Europe until 2050. In this report. we take the first steps towards identifying the potential future role for dispatchable renewables–specifically CSP (MUSTEC project) and dam hydropower (SCCER JA IDEA project)–as a function of policy decisions that either increase the need for flexibility (eg fluctuating renewables) or provide flexibility (eg storage. dispatchable renewables. flexible demand).,True,ZGgy9uwAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,6,https://mustec.eu/sites/default/files/reports/Lilliestam_et%20al_2019_Policy_pathways_for_the_energy_transition_in_Europe_and_selected_European_countries.pdf,17421701738598986225,/scholar?cites=17421701738598986225,,,https://mustec.eu/sites/default/files/reports/Lilliestam_et%20al_2019_Policy_pathways_for_the_energy_transition_in_Europe_and_selected_European_countries.pdf,0,0,0

1332618,Effect of auctions on RES value chains,2020,P del Rio and C Kiefer and C Menzies and M Marquardt and O Fitch-Roy and B Woodman,,,,,AURES II,It is often argued that a key feature of auctions is the competitive pressure created on the overall value chain. and indeed all actors of the renewable energy (RE) sector. Moreover. it is often argued that auctions can induce a reduction in the level of actor diversity (AD) in some segments of the value chain. and especially in the project development sector. In the process of designing an auction. policy makers must make specific decisions and trade-offs related to the auction design elements (DEs). Depending on those trade-offs. auctions may favour certain types of actors over others. and this may lead to increased levels of market concentration (MC). This present study empirically analyses the following two topics: • The impacts of different auction DEs on MC in the project development and component manufacturing segments of the RE value chain. • The relative impact of auctions (as compared to other (contextual) factors influencing the value chain) on MC in the project development and component manufacturing segments of the value chain. Case study analysis were undertaken in four countries. namely Peru (solar PV; wind power). Spain (onshore wind power). South Africa (solar PV; wind power; and concentrated solar power (CSP)). and the United Kingdom (offshore wind).

Therefore. utilization of solar energy for operation of desalination systems will reduce greenhouse gases and is a good alternative way.

The CO2 concentration is widely used as an indicator of the pollutant contaminant in indoor air and it often changes with time on account of the number of occupants. With the proposed methodology. the number of occupants can be estimated from the realtime measurement of the CO2 concentration of the outdoor air and the indoor air. As known. not only occupants but also buildings themselves contribute to potential indoor-air-quality problems. ASHRAE Standard 62-1989R guideline gives the design ventilation rate based on both occupancy and building space. According to ASHRAE Standard 62-1989R. the estimated number of the occupants and the area of ventilation-controlled space are used to determine the design ventilation rate required for acceptable indoor air quality. This design ventilation rate allows the Heating. Ventilating and Air-conditioning system to produce the acceptable indoor air quality at efficient energy usage. The experimental results show the viability of the proposed method-controlling ventilation based on estimated occupants.,True,BQdxEMMAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,49,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.9417&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=75,17285677411479320009,/scholar?cites=17285677411479320009,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.129.9417&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=75,0,0,0

To use CNG as alternative fuel. the engine. compression ignition system. needs to be converted to spark ignition system and makes reduction on compression ratio (CR) that matches the properties of CNG. Consequently. due to conversion. the thermal efficiency and fuel consumption is dropped. In this paper. the light duty truck that equipped with 3.0-liters commonrail diesel engine was converted to natural gas spark ignition engine. In addition. this vehicle was test with driving cycle on the controlled environment chassis dynamometer and the EUDC (European Driving Cycle Test) was selected for fuel consumption and emission study. The results were compared to the standard test made by vehicle's company. The CNG consumption was approximately 5.91 km/kg which 2.5 time compare to standard's vehicle test result using diesel as fuel.

The study investigated the DCHE of Ø114mm and 1000 mm height using evaporated refrigerant as disperse phase and solidified water as continuous phase. The heat transfer rate across the DCHE was varied between 3.0 and 6.5 kW while the water flow rate across an heat exchanger were varied. and its inlet temperatures were controlled at 13 C and 15 C. As a result. the freezing point deviation of the ice-water solution was found to be 7.95 C.

If a general strategy could be devised to yield nonlinear thermal transport. it would provide an avenue to controlling heat flow and realizing nonlinear thermal devices. Phase-change materials. which can exist in two states with distinct thermal conductivities. provide a unique opportunity to realize nonlinear thermal transport.

1332739,Oxidation processes: experimental study and theoretical investigations,2004,Nada Al Ananzeh,,,,,,Oxidation reactions are of prime importance at an industrial level and correspond to a huge market. Oxidation reactions are widely practiced in industry and are thoroughly studied in academic and industrial laboratories. Achievements in oxidation process resulted in the development of many new selective oxidation processes. Environmental protection also relies mainly on oxidation reactions. Remarkable results obtained in this field contributed to promote the social image of chemistry which gradually changes from being the enemy of nature to becoming its friend and savior. This study dealt with two aspects regarding oxidation process. The first aspect represented an experimental study for the catalytic partial oxidation of benzene to phenol using Pd membrane in the gaseous phase. The second part was a theoretical study for some of the advanced oxidation process (AOPs) which are applied for contaminant destructions in polluted waters.Niwa and coworkers* reported a one step catalytic process to convert benzene to phenol using Pd membrane. According to their work. this technique will produce a higher yield than current cumene and nitrous oxide based industrial routes to phenol. A similar system to produce phenol from benzene in one step was studied in this work. Results at low conversion of benzene to phenol were obtained with a different selectivity from the reported work. High conversion to phenol was not obtained using the same arrangement as the reported one. High conversion to phenol was obtained using a scheme different from the one reported by Niwa et al1. It was found that producing phenol from benzene is not related to …,True,Rgs_xJAAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,9,https://digital.wpi.edu/downloads/bg257f11m,10768986008761279563,/scholar?cites=10768986008761279563,,,https://digital.wpi.edu/downloads/bg257f11m,0,0,0

Han blir besatt av tanken på en jernbana–senare av bygget av norra Stambanan–genom hans hemsocken Lillvattnet. Skogsbolagen vill komma åt de orörda skogarna. Lillvattnets folk fruktar världen som den ter sig genom jernbaneloket–ett vidunder ur Uppenbarelseboken. Rallarna ses som hedningar. och Didrik vill högst av allt försona alla med jernbanans idé.

Today. the fundamental challenge of integrating renewable energies into the design of smart cities is more relevant than ever. While based on the advent of big data and the use of information and communication technologies. smart cities must now respond to cross-cutting issues involving urban development. energy and environmental constraints; further. these cities must also explore how they can integrate more sustainable energies. Sustainable energies are a major determinant of smart cities’ longevity.

1332762,Hvor solen græder,2014,Puk Damsgård,,,,,Politikens Forlag,"Nour levede et sorgløst storbyliv i Damaskus. Hun kørte på arbejde i egen bil og drak cocktails med veninderne. indtil syrerne i 2011 begyndte deres oprør mod præsident Bashar al-Assad. Revolutionen forvandlede Syrien til et land i borgerkrig og forandrede Nours liv for altid. Hvor solen græder er Puk Damsgårds på én gang gribende og rædselsvækkende fortælling om at kæmpe for frihed og forfølge sin revolutionsforelskelse på trods. men også om. hvad der sker. når kampen for at holde sig i live overskygger længslen efter demokrati. Puk Damsgård er den danske journalist. der har rejst mest i Syrien. Bogen er hendes personlige beretning om at blive smuglet over grænsen for at rapportere fra et land i opløsning og om mennesker. hvis liv er i en permanent undtagelsestilstand. Vi møder blandt andre den heroiske og lattermilde læge Dr. Kassem og den unge Mohannad. der modvilligt er draget i krig. mens han drømmer om at blive gift med sin elskede. Men først og fremmest følger bogen storbykvinden Nour. der i en frihedsrus engagerer sig i det syriske oprør. som ender med at blive hendes livs mareridt. Hvor solen græder tager læseren med på en sjælden rejse ind bagfrontlinjerne i en krig. hvor mere end 150.000 mennesker er blevet dræbt. og millioner er sendt på flugt. Om forfatteren: Puk Damsgård. f. 1978. er uddannet journalist fra Syddansk Universitet. Hun har siden juli 2011 været DR's mellemøstkorrespondent med base i Beirut og nu Kairo.

1332763,Genetic agent approach for improving on-the-fly web map generalization,2012,Brahim Lejdel and Okba Kazar,2,International Journal of Information Technology Convergence and Services,3,1,Academy & Industry Research Collaboration Center (AIRCC),The utilization of web mapping becomes increasingly important in the domain of cartography. Users want access to spatial data on the web specific to their needs. For this reason. different approaches were appeared for generating on-the-fly the maps demanded by users. but those not suffice for guide a flexible and efficient process. Thus. new approach must be developed for improving this process according to the user needs. This work focuses on defining a new strategy which improves on-the-fly map generalization process and resolves the spatial conflicts. This approach uses the multiple representation and cartographic generalization. The map generalization process is based on the implementation of multiagent system where each agent was equipped with a genetic patrimony.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT],True,tNIVOakAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,2,https://search.proquest.com/openview/c236cc1d1b27188795cbf6224e1a4292/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=646388,17527525279274657489,/scholar?cites=17527525279274657489,,,,0,0,0
1332764,Arvet efter Arn,2002,Jan Guillou,,,,,Piratförlaget,Ingrid Ylva blev en legend redan i sin livstid vid mitten av 1200-talet. Hon var en av flera starka änkor som styrde riket efter de blodiga segrarna mot Danmark. Om henne sades att hon var trollkunnig och att så länge hon höll sitt huvud högt skulle intet ont drabba folkungaätten. Med järnvilja fostrade hon sina söner i en skoningslös tid där den starkares rätt var den enda lag som gällde. Att just en av hennes söner till slut skulle segra i maktkampen kunde inte ha förvånat någon. Men med en hänsynslöshet som till och med skrämde hans samtid krossade Birger Magnusson maffiaväldet för all framtid. Och de lagar han stiftade om hemfrid. kyrkofrid och kvinnofrid blev rikets norm för 600 år framåt. Historien känner honom som Birger jarl. Stockholms grundare och Sveriges skapare. Men sagan om Birger är mycket större än så. Arn Magnusson må ha varit ett helgon. Det var sannerligen inte Birger. Men han var en segrare som inte vek undan för moraliska eller praktiska hinder på sin väg från yngling i Västra Götaland till riksbyggare. Arvet efter Arn är en vacker och blodig riddarsaga där marken skälver under dundrande hästhovar och skummet yr om korsfararnas fartygsbogar på väg österut. Det är också berättelsen om förlorad kärlek som en del av maktens höga pris. Detta är en fristående fortsättning på Jan Guillous trilogi om riddare Arn Magnusson.

It involves methods and technologies for organizations to identify models or patterns for data. Big data bring enormous benefits to the business process. Big data properties such as volume. velocity. variety. variation and veracity. render the existing techniques of data analysis not sufficient. Big data analysis requires the fusion of regression techniques for data mining with those of machine learning. Big data regression is an important field for many researchers. several aspects. methods. and techniques proposed. In this context. we suggest regression curve models for big data system. Our proposition is based on cooperative MapReduce architecture. We offer Map and Reduce algorithms for curve regression. in the Map phase; data transform in the linear model. in the reduce phase we propose a k-means algorithm for clustering the results of Map phase. K-means algorithm is one of the most popular partition clustering algorithms; it is simple. statistical and considerably scalable. Also. it has linear asymptotic running time concerning any variable of the problem. This approach combines the advantage of regression and clustering methods in big data.

1332767,A Conceptual Framework for Modeling Smart Parking,2020,Brahim Lejdel,,,,,IntechOpen,Vehicles are highly used in the city. If the drivers of vehicles have an appointment in the city. they are looking for parking. Thus. they need to know where to find one in real time. In this paper. we present a smart model that is based on a combination of multi-agent system and genetic algorithm (MAS-GA). The smart model can help the drivers find the optimal parking when the drivers make a request for parking according to their position on the road and the waiting and parking time. This smart model is based on four parameters: the availability of parking. cost of parking. the distance between the actual position of the vehicle and the destination parking. and traffic congestion. We can also add the time to arrive a destination parking. Thus. the proposed smart model helps to maximize the utilization of space resources of a city as parking and reduce the waiting and parking time.,True,tNIVOakAAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC,1,https://www.intechopen.com/books/application-of-expert-systems-theoretical-and-practical-aspects/a-conceptual-framework-for-modeling-smart-parking,4071568507343394759,/scholar?cites=4071568507343394759,,,https://www.intechopen.com/books/application-of-expert-systems-theoretical-and-practical-aspects/a-conceptual-framework-for-modeling-smart-parking,0,0,0

Owing to the presence of pollutants such as sulfides. mercaptans and phenols. SC is known to be among the most difficult class of wastes to be treated and disposed. Several existing technologies have been applied to treat SC; however. they require extreme operation conditions of pressure and temperature. These methods are neither environment friendly nor cost effective. Thus. efforts are directed toward removal of specific pollutants particularly phenols. sulfides and mercaptans from SC streams in simple and environment-friendly manner. In this work. two hydrophobic ionic liquids (IL). tetrahexylammoniumdihexyl-sulfosuccinate (IL1) and trioctylmethylammonium salicylate (IL2). were used to treat industrial SC at room temperature using both bench scale batch contactor and sequential batch contactor modes. UVVis spectroscopy. gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) analysis were employed for SC characterization. The chemical composition and the COD values of SC were determined before and after treatment with IL1 and IL2. The operating conditions for extraction were optimized.

The mathematical model was constructed with the assumptions on curved channels. After applying the boundary layer approximation on the Navier–Stocks equation. we produced nonlinear partial differential equations. These equations were converted into a system of non-dimensional ordinary differential equations through an appropriate similarity transformation. The dimensionless forms of the coupled ordinary differential equations were elucidated numerically through boundary value problem fourth order method. This method gains fast convergence as compared to other method such as the shooting method and the Numerical Solution of Differential Equations Mathematica method.

1332830,A descriptive analysis of public understanding and attitudes of renewable energy resources towards energy access and development in Nigeria,2014,Yusuf Opeyemi Akinwale and Ibikunle Olalekan Ogundari and Oluwatosin Eniola Ilevbare and Adeyemi Oluwaseun Adepoju,4,International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy,4,636,Econjournals,Nigeria government has set a target of becoming among the top 20 economies by the year 2020. The argument here is not whether this can be achieved or not within the stipulated time. but rather achieving a sustainable economic growth through a clean energy system. The development of renewable energies in every region of the country is one of the tactics that can be used to achieve clean energy. This paper examined the attitudes and understanding of the public towards renewable energy sources and technologies so as to enhance the provision of electricity. The study was conducted in the south west Nigeria using a field questionnaire survey. The study found out that the large numbers of respondents are aware of renewable energy but they do not have a deep understanding of it. Most of the respondents support the use of renewable energy to supplement the current national grid instead of the present dominance of diesel/petrol generating set. Also. the public are willing to pay more for electricity supply once it is stable. Meanwhile. the willingness to pay more for the electricity decreases with the respondents’ age but increases with the respondents’ income. This implies that people will be willing to pay more for electricity when their incomes increase and also when they are relatively young. The study therefore suggests strong political commitment of Nigeria government on renewable energy applications as well as creation of enabling environment for the private sectors to successfully utilised renewable energy technologies.,True,2qMVS64AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,31,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adeyemi_Adepoju3/publication/287253578_A_Descriptive_Analysis_of_Public_Understanding_and_Attitudes_of_Renewable_Energy_Resources_towards_Energy_Access_and_Development_in_Nigeria/links/5f5ea589299bf1d43c01c0cc/A-Descriptive-Analysis-of-Public-Understanding-and-Attitudes-of-Renewable-Energy-Resources-towards-Energy-Access-and-Development-in-Nigeria.pdf,11103581663100250673,/scholar?cites=11103581663100250673,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adeyemi_Adepoju3/publication/287253578_A_Descriptive_Analysis_of_Public_Understanding_and_Attitudes_of_Renewable_Energy_Resources_towards_Energy_Access_and_Development_in_Nigeria/links/5f5ea589299bf1d43c01c0cc/A-Descriptive-Analysis-of-Public-Understanding-and-Attitudes-of-Renewable-Energy-Resources-towards-Energy-Access-and-Development-in-Nigeria.pdf,0,0,0

This has called for several measures to reduce the emissions generated into the atmosphere. One of such is the blending of ethanol and gasoline for the use of motor vehicles. The blend of both mixtures is known to improve the octane index. But the problem of recovery of ethanol from the fermentation broth involves distillation of the dilute aqueous alcohol to its azeotrope. This is the basis for the study in addition to generating parameter of interaction coefficients through multiple regressions for use in physical property prediction models at various temperatures. We investigated the process packed distillation column by comparing the efficiency results of conventional packing system (the high and low voidage packing) and the modification of the column to accommodate multiple packing (combinations of both low and high voidage packing). The results showed that efficiencies of the combinations are better than that of the conventional high voidage packing but slightly lower compared to the conventional low-voidage packing. We conclude by suggesting that firm processes involving the use of distillation techniques can be modified to accommodate combination of multiple packing for optimum efficiency. This invariably makes the firm that use this approach more efficient and profitable.,True,2qMVS64AAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/37714647/adepoju_etal_humboldt2015.pdf,,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/37714647/adepoju_etal_humboldt2015.pdf,0,0,0

Levulinic acid. a product of hydrolysis of biomass. is a renewable chemical with various potential applications in several industries. such as chemical. pharmaceutical and food. However. its production in large scale is hampered because of deficient reactor and recovery technologies. Recovery of levulinic acid is a cumbersome task since degradation of biomass in high temperatures also leads to production of humins. In this work. the recovery of levulinic acid from biomass hydrolysate was evaluated using the UNIFAC group contribution method. As consequence of the dilute nature of the process and the presence of water. two scenarios with two different organic. aprotic solvents were tested to perform liquid-liquid extraction of levulinic acid: 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) and hexane. Both scenarios were optimized considering the all process requirements for solvent recovery and recycling. and the overall process was evaluated in terms of capital and operational expenditures. Although hexane is a traditional extraction solvent option in industry. results demonstrated that the use of MTHF leads to a recovery cost 26% lower than using hexane.

Moreover. the main sugar commonly obtained from this process. xylose. is proven to have a low fermentation performance when compared to glucose. Xylose and other pentoses easily dehydrate to furfural. a furan which has demonstrated potential to be produced at low cost. This low-cost possibility opens opportunities to other uses. such as applications in the fuels market. Furfural itself cannot be used as fuel since it is very unstable. and therefore it requires a chemical upgrade. This work presents the technoeconomic assessment of the chemical upgrade of furfural to ethyl levulinate. In this process. furfural is hydrogenated to furfuryl alcohol. which is then mixed with ethanol in a reaction to open the furan ring to yield ethyl levulinate. Hydrogenation is a crucial. costly step of this process. and two options of hydrogen source were considered: steam reforming of natural gas. representing a benchmark. and electrolysis of water using electricity produced from biomass as a renewable counterpart. Economic and sensitivity analysis determined a maximum buying price range for furfural to make the chemical upgrade economically feasible. aiming at an internal rate of return of 10% and considering the selling price of ethyl levulinate to be the same of diesel on an energy basis.

Experimental tests were carried out using pulper as the solid waste. However. while a reliable composition analysis of the produced syngas was carried out. a precise composition evaluation of the pulper used during the experimental activities was not performed and the related data were characterized by unacceptable uncertainty. Therefore. with the aim of reliably characterizing the plant operation. a thermochemical model of the gasification process was setup to simulate the equilibrium operation of the plant and a vector optimization methodology was used to calibrate the numerical model. Then. a decision-making problem was solved to identify the most suitable optimal solution between those belonging to the Pareto optimal front. thus obtaining reliable composition data for the adopted pulper waste. In particular. four different identification criteria were applied for the selection of small subset of solutions over the 3138 dominant solutions found. Among them. the solution (ie. set of calibration parameters) that minimizes the experimental-numerical difference between the lower heating value of the produced syngas seemed to provide the most reliable approximation of the real plant operation. Finally. a possible plant configuration is proposed for the energetic valorization of the pulper waste and its overall conversion process efficiency is estimated.

1332921,Computation of skin friction and heat transfer with inclusion of stagnation heating of roughness elements for turbulent boundary layer flows,1988,PK Bishnoi,26,26th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting,,,,Surface roughness is known to substantially affect the skin friction and the surface heat transfer in various flow applications. The roughness effects are modeled through distributed sources and sinks in the appropriate governing equations. The form-drag due to roughness elements is modeled through a sink term in the momentum equation. A stagnation-heating term introduced in energy equation accounts for the tendency of roughness elements to augment heating at the surface. The governing boundary-layer equations for continuity. momentum and energy are derived in a form to account for blockage due to the roughness elements. A two-layer algebraic mixing length model is used to replace the Reynolds stress terms. The resulting equations. with appropriate boundary conditions. are solved by finite-difference techniques to determine velocity and temperature distribution in the boundary-layer region of the flow …,True,4MQDG7sAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,1,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988aiaa.meetX....B/abstract,14950594065270633175,/scholar?cites=14950594065270633175,,,,0,0,0

Microanal,,2,,Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) produces scattered electrons and different kind of signals are registered in sync with the electron probe scanning. The resolution of the STEM is mostly determined by the size of the probe [1]. Characterization of materials at atomic level is possible with the aberration correctors. which can provide of a different contrast as a function of the atomic number (Z-contrast imaging). In this work we present the results from the characterization of multifunctional oxide BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) thin films grown on silicon using conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cs-corrected STEM.Film growths were carried out using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in one chamber of a multichamber system dedicated to the growth of oxides. The nucleation and growth of STO on Si used elemental sources and molecular oxygen as detailed in ref [2]. The BFO layer was also grown using elemental Bi and Fe sources from effusion cells but with atomic oxygen generated in a plasma source.

It underlines firstly. the elements of continuation in US foreign policy under the Presidents Clinton. Bush Jr. and Obama. Secondly it looks at the “change” in Turkish foreign policy under the AKP since 2002. It sees the Iraqi War as a turning point in the demise of the strategic partnership. The developments in its aftermath can be considered as a path to the formation of what would be named by Obama as a “Model Partnership”. It contends that the prevailing determinants of relations stem in the US case from security concerns. while for the AKP it serves its policy of omnibalancing.

Ltd.,In an article written in 2003. the contours of Turkish foreign policy were summarized as traditionally being shaped by five factors: historical experiences. geopolitical and geostrategic location which provide a unique position for the country. a number of vulnerabilities. the political ideology of the governing elite (Kemalism) and the demands of systemic. regional and domestic changes on the country’s external relations at any time (see Aydın 2003. 307–8). From the late 1990s onwards. there have been change and re-thinking on almost all of these factors. From then on. although historical experiences did not change. they were often re-visited and re-interpreted. given new meanings and at times romanticized. The geo-strategic importance of the country was re-emphasized in such a way that it was put forward as a factor bringing new opportunities.“responsibilities” and roles. This was different from the Cold War understanding of Turkey’s geostrategic importance where a more defensive. status quo stance was legitimized rather than activism.Turkish foreign policy remained security-oriented until the late 1990s. The systemic changes brought about by the end of the Cold War did not translate simultaneously into a decrease of threat perceptions in Turkey. With the demise of the Soviet Union Turkey’s perception of threat from the north was reduced. only to be replaced with the threat from the south. especially from Syria. Iran and Iraq. According to some scholars. during the 1990s. Turkey was facing “2½ Wars”(see Elekdağ 1996). However. the end of the 1990s witnessed a remarkable shift concerning the threat perceptions and the vulnerabilities that led …,True,4Ac3-f0AAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,14,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pceXCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA7&dq=info:btgqEcWceL0J:scholar.google.com&ots=OsiCr_TojL&sig=f6k_ZZlAhRnmF3TLZjTdasGe4x4,13652834640584169582,/scholar?cites=13652834640584169582,,,,0,0,0

Bu çalışma adeta bir önkabul haline gelmiş olan Afganistan’ın önemini jeopolitik çerçevede incelemek ve bu biçimde Afganistan’ın uluslararası sistem üzerinde geçmişte ve bugün oynadığı rolü anlamlandırmaya çalışmaktadır. Bunu yaparken ülkeye yapılan iki süpergüç müdahalesini. SSCB’nin Afganistan’ı işgali (1979) ile 11 Eylül olayı sonrası ABD ve NATO’nun Afganistan’a müdahalesi (2001). merkeze alarak bu her iki müdahaleyi uluslararası ortamın koşulları. aktörlerin öncelikleri. bölgesel tepkiler ve müdahalelerin uluslararası sistem üzerindeki etkileri açısından incelemektedir.

1332956,Evaluation of Sakarya River Streamflow and Sediment Transport with Rainfall Using Trend Analysis,2013,G Ceribasi and E Dogan and O Sonmez,22,Fresenius Environmental Bulletin,3A,846-852,,Water has always been the focus of living things and civilizations have been established mainly in areas close to water. However. to meet the growing need for water. measures were taken such as transporting water from areas with abundant water to areas with water scarcity. The most effective method is to examine the behavior of water in the past and to estimate its future behavior. On the other hand. excess water. which is transported at the time of a flood carries a lot of sediment and transported sediment results in significant losses during floods. Thus. it is also important to know the change of sediment transport with water over time. In addition. possible rainfall which may come in future needs to be estimated by looking also at the history of rainfall that comes with rain. Excessive rains cause flooding and sediment transported by the flood causes erosion. Therefore. in this study. the relationship among Sakarya River streamflow and sediment transported with rainfall is analyzed by applying trend analysis. The Mann-Kendall test and Spearman Rho test were used in the study. The Mann-Kendall Rank Correlation test was used to determine the trend’s starting year. An analysis of test results revealed a downward trend in The Spearman’s Rho test and Mann-Kendall test. In Mann-Kendall Order Correlation test conducted to obtain the starting year of the trend. a direct relationship was found among the starting years of the trend in each parameter. Thus. the trends declining also for each parameters show a direct relationship among the streamflow. sediment and rainfall. In addition. downward trends in test statistics of Sakarya River also indicate that …,True,YgD8PRQAAAAJ:-_dYPAW6P2MC,19,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gokmen_Ceribasi/publication/288381413_Evaluation_of_Sakarya_River_Streamflow_and_Sediment_Transport_with_Rainfall_Using_Trend_Analysis/links/5937d634a6fdcc5e6eac341f/Evaluation-of-Sakarya-River-Streamflow-and-Sediment-Transport-with-Rainfall-Using-Trend-Analysis.pdf,3860711760177153249,/scholar?cites=3860711760177153249,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gokmen_Ceribasi/publication/288381413_Evaluation_of_Sakarya_River_Streamflow_and_Sediment_Transport_with_Rainfall_Using_Trend_Analysis/links/5937d634a6fdcc5e6eac341f/Evaluation-of-Sakarya-River-Streamflow-and-Sediment-Transport-with-Rainfall-Using-Trend-Analysis.pdf,0,0,0

This study presents the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and trend analysis methods in predicting short and long term streamflows. Estimations was made by using flow datas of Sakarya River. Turkey between 1989 and 2000. In ANN models were based on the daily streamflow data for predicting short term streamflows although trend analysis methods were based on the monthly streamflow data for predicating long term streamflows. The flow data of 4.018 days were used as training and testing sets for the chosen all ANN models in this study. Among these. 2.650 days (approximately% 65 of all data) were reserved for the calibration/training set and the remaining data (approximately% 35 of all data) were used for the validation/testing set. For predicting flow of Sakarya Rivers. seven different scenarios were analyzed for four different ANN models and three different trend analysis method. The performance criteria of the neural network is depend of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Nash-Sutcliffe Sufficiency Score (NSSS) and coefficient of correlation (R-value) parameters. The results were compared with each other for determine the best approaches. For long term streamflow prediction. The Mann-Kendall test and Spearman Rho test were used in the study.

Earlier studies focus on erosion features on shores and coasts and sometimes on desert plains as a result of wind erosion. but hardly on roads. Erosion features are detrimental to road designers. constructors. and users. This paper focused on gravel roads which constitute a larger percentage of the rural roads. These are a key to accumulation of wealth for developing countries. It also looked at the identification. formation. and extracting effects of features as a result of erosion on the road surface pertaining to various road surface characteristics. Rills and dunes on roads are active features which gully up bigger parts of the roads causing flooding and other dangerous effects. Various experiments like sieve analysis. runoff speeds and measuring road rill/dune sizes with respect to slope size. rain intensity. and road sizes were considered for this study.

Engineering and Technology,Selecting the data modeling technique for an information system is determined by the objective of the resultant data model. Dimensional modeling is the preferred modeling technique for data destined for data warehouses and data mining. presenting data models that ease analysis and queries which are in contrast with entity relationship modeling. The establishment of data warehouses as components of information system landscapes in many organizations has subsequently led to the development of dimensional modeling. This has been significantly more developed and reported for the commercial database management systems as compared to the open sources thereby making it less affordable for those in resource constrained settings. This paper presents dimensional modeling of HIV patient information using open source modeling tools. It aims to take advantage of the fact that the most affected regions by the HIV virus are also heavily resource constrained (sub-Saharan Africa) whereas having large quantities of HIV data. Two HIV data source systems were studied to identify appropriate dimensions and facts these were then modeled using two open source dimensional modeling tools. Use of open source would reduce the software costs for dimensional modeling and in turn make data warehousing and data mining more feasible even for those in resource constrained settings but with data available.,True,C-Fu6F4AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,2,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:835129,13712533342447298153,/scholar?cites=13712533342447298153,,,,0,0,0

The model was based on parameters such as the nature or make of the road. erosion effect. and the effect of repairs. The rill/dune effects on the road were assumed to be proportional to the repairs that are necessary to neutralize them. The repairs model was first analyzed then the general erosion model. Finally. an erosion model that combines all the parameters was developed and analyzed with a numerical example. The main methods used included experimental designs and numerical techniques for the formulation and analysis. Results show that the approximate time required for road repairs given a remarkable effect. reduces with the size of the initial effect. A bigger initial effect reduces the time required to initiate a repair on such roads. Results further showed that erosion effects resulting from the rill/dune development effects are tremendously reduced.

At the European Union level. the transport sector is responsible for approximately 28% of greenhouse gas emissions. and 84% of them are associated with road transport. One of the most effective ways to enhance the de-carbonization process of the transport sector is through the promotion of electric propulsion. which involves overcoming barriers related to reduced driving autonomy and the long time required to recharge the batteries. This paper develops and implements a method meant to increase the autonomy and reduce the battery charging time of an electric car to comparable levels of an internal combustion engine vehicle. By doing so. the cost of such vehicles is the only remaining significant barrier in the way of a mass spread of electric propulsion. The chosen method is to hybridize the electric powertrain by using an additional source of fuel; hydrogen gas stored in pressurized cylinders is converted. in situ. into electrical energy by means of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The power generated on board can then be used. under the command of a dedicated management system. for battery charging. leading to an increase in the vehicle’s autonomy. Modeling and simulation results served to easily adjust the size of the fuel cell hybrid electric powertrain.

This paper focuses on electric fuel cell vehicles. which optimally combine the fuel cell system with hybrid energy storage systems. represented by batteries and ultracapacitors. to meet the dynamic power demand required by the electric motor and auxiliary systems. This paper compares the latest proposed topologies for fuel cell electric vehicles and reveals the new technologies and DC/DC converters involved to generate up-to-date information for researchers and developers interested in this specialized field.

Power-following control (PFC) is used for either the air regulator or the fuel regulator of the FC system. or it is switched to the inputs of the air and hydrogen regulators based on a threshold of load demand; these strategies are referred to as air-PFC. fuel-PFC. and air/fuel-PFC. respectively. The performance and safe operation of the FC system and battery-based ESS under these strategies is compared to the static feed-forward (sFF) control used by most commercial strategies implemented in FC systems. FC/renewable HPSs. and FC vehicles. This study highlights the benefits of using a PFC-based strategy to establish FC-system fueling flows. in addition to an optimal control of the boost power converter to maximize fuel economy. For example. the fuel economy for a 6 kW FC system using the air/fuel-PFC strategy compared to the strategies air-PFC. fuel-PFC. and the sFF benchmark is 6.60%. 7.53%. and 12.60% of the total hydrogen consumed by these strategies under a load profile of up and down the stairs using 1 kW/2 s per step. For an FC/ESS/renewable system. the fuel economy of an air/fuel-PFC strategy compared to same strategies is 7.28%. 8.23%. and 13.43%. which is better by about 0.7% because an FC system operates at lower power due to the renewable energy available in this case study.

Due to the low energy of tritium betas. about 5.7 keV. the measuring system noise threshold should be less than 5 keV. The noise is mainly determined by the detector and the first stage of pre-amplification. The established model of the noise performance of the system shows a temperature dependence.

All samples were sectioned from recycled automotive cylinder head and solution heat treated at 495°C. 510°C and 525°C each for a period of 10 hours. All samples were then quenched into ice water at 0°C and followed by artificial ageing at 180°C for a time up to 20 hours.

Precipitation occurrence were characterised by thermal analysis method and SEM/EDX technique on critical sample. The effect of heat treatment processes was observed by metallographic technique. It is seen that the aluminium alloy exhibit age hardening response similar to artificial ageing where as the the peak-age hardening accelerated when higher solution temperature applied. The hardening effect achieved was due to precipitation of metastable phases of θ˝/θ΄. β˝/β΄. and Q˝Q΄ except for 495°C where the coarser silicon particles contributes to the peak-aged hardening.

Despite field surveys published in the scientific literature suggesting a correlation between tar-spot and SO2 levels. an air pollution aetiology for the low incidence of urban tar-spot has remained controversial. The aim of this thesis was to discover what effects air pollutants might have on the pathogen's biology and epidemiology. including interactions with other phyllosphere organisms. In this context. a transect was established along an air pollution gradient in the London area. and a similar transect was set up in Edinburgh.Re-colonisation of urban centres in South Yorkshire by R. acerhmm and of major UK city centres by blackspot of rose {Diplocarpon rosae) was also examined to investigate the possibility of a memory effect (ie time lag in re-invasion) following a sharp drop in SO2 levels in the last three decades.

1333099,Theoretical foundations,2015,Maria Ioannou and Nicolas Jarraud and Christopher Louise,,Predicting Peace,,42,,This chapter traces the evolution of the concepts which underpin the social cohesion and reconciliation index (SCORE). The purpose is to deepen SCORE users understanding of the index and its role in assessing degrees of conflict and peace. The analysis is grounded in a literature review which demonstrates that social cohesion and reconciliation are highly complex abstractions that can be understood either as multi-dimensional phenomena. or as multi-component constructs. SCORE’s methodology treats the two as multicomponent constructs; abstract constructs that both consist of. and at the same time underlie. other. less complex components. The construction of the index is grounded in our hypothesis that these components inter-connect and influence each other. This is a working assumption elicited from the findings of previous studies on the relationship between the components of reconciliation and social cohesion.Social cohesion and reconciliation can either be studied independently or together. The SCORE index does both. We are interested in mapping the two dimensions independently. but also in seeing if and how. they may relate to each other. This literature review will attempt to highlight possible or previously established connections between the components of one dimension. and the components of another. Finally. we will outline examples of international best practice in the analysis of each component.,True,FqZrFLUAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,5,https://www.undp.org/content/dam/rbec/docs/Predicting%20Peace_SCORE.PDF#page=43,8830027597480326070,/scholar?cites=8830027597480326070,,,https://www.undp.org/content/dam/rbec/docs/Predicting%20Peace_SCORE.PDF#page=43,0,0,0

One oflignocellulosic biomass. palm oil empty fruit bunch (EFB). has major content of cellulose (30-40%). which is highly potential to be a raw material for fermentable sugar production. In this research. a series of sulfonated carbon catalysts with various concentrations of sulfuric acid (H2SO4. 10-30 v/v%) solutions have been successfully prepared and applied for a single stage of heterogeneous acid-catalyzed hydrolysis over microcrystalline cellulose and EFB under moderate temperature condition and ambient pressure. The catalysts' physical and chemical properties were characterized by using a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA). X-ray diffractometer. surface area analyzer. and Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometer. The characterization results showed that sulfonated carbon had relatively similar physical properties with the parent of active carbon. The hydrolysis activity of sulfonated carbon catalysts gave various Total Reducing Sugar (TRS). The effects of sulfate loading amount in catalyst samples and various ionic liquids were investigated. The hydrolysis of pure microcrystalline cellulose powder (Avicel) using 30%-sulfonated carbon (30-SC) catalyst in i-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIMjCl) ionic liquid at 150 C yielded the highest TRS of 16.11%. Subsequently. the catalyst of 30-SC was also tested for hydrolysis of EFB and produced the highest TRS of 40.76% in [BMIMjCl ionic liquid at 150 C for 4 h.

However. there is still some ambiguity about the location of two of the modes in the solid state. The aim of this work was to locate all of the modes by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy.(which has no selection rules). and to use periodic density functional theory to provide a complete and unambiguous assignment of all the modes in the solid state. A comparison of the observed and calculated INS spectra shows generally good agreement. All four of the ν 2 bending mode components are calculated to fall within 14 cm− 1. Inspection of the spectrum shows that there are no bands close to the intense feature at 390 cm− 1 (assigned to ν 2); this very strongly indicates that the A u mode is within the envelope of the 390 cm− 1 band. Based on a simulation of the band shape of the 390 cm− 1 feature. the most likely position of the optically forbidden component of the ν 2 bending mode is 393±2 cm− 1. The calculations show that the optically inactive A u translational mode is strongly dispersed. so it does not result in a single feature in the INS spectrum.

Generally. homogenous acid catalysts are used to accelerate the reaction rate due to their excellent performance in the reaction. The catalysts provide high conversion of carboxylic acids and good selectivity to produce esters. However. it has several drawbacks. such as difficulty catalyst-product separation. corrosiveness. toxic waste production. and non-reusable. It is. therefore. necessary to develop heterogeneous catalysts for the reaction. Zeolite has potential to use as a catalyst for esterification. Yet. it is sometimes easily to be deactivated due to the formation of coke on its surface. This paper presents a preliminary study of zeolite as a catalyst for esterification reaction.

However. the use of synthetic polymers has negative impacts on the environment. because it is difficult to degrade naturally either by the biotic or abiotic process. Although their complete replacement with eco-friendly packaging films is just impossible to achieve economically. at least for a specific application like food packaging the use of bioplastics should be the future. One of the alternatives is to blend synthetic polymer for instance polypropylene (PP) with a natural polymer like poly-lactic acid (PLA). Because their mixture is an immiscible blend because they have highly different polarity. it is necessary to add a compatibilizer such as polypropylene-grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MAH) in order to increase the properties of its blend miscibility. The objective of this research was to study the influence of PLA addition to the thermal properties of their blend product with PP. The combinations of PP with PLA in the ratios of (80: 20);(90: 10);(95: 5) were prepared and then characterized for their thermal property behaviour by means of TG and DSC. The results showed that increasing the amount of PLA will decrease their enthalpy significantly,True,Zm8USRsAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://inajac.lipi.go.id/index.php/InaJAC/article/view/329,,,,,https://inajac.lipi.go.id/index.php/InaJAC/article/download/329/463,0,0,0

The departure from the public sector driven Green Revolution model has given rise to new concerns about competition in the seed market. India's cotton seed market exemplifies these new developments. This study examines the evolution in its market structure and the factors that underlie the changes. The study finds that while the private sector has grown rapidly in the last decade (when these policies and technological developments were operative). their dominance of the market cannot be ascribed directly to any of the conventionally cited factors. Furthermore. despite more than a decade after the removal of FDI restrictions. the presence of foreign majors is limited. The rapid growth has been driven by domestic firms. The growth was not accompanied by greater consolidation in the industry. As the proprietary market has grown. more private players have come into the market eating away at the share of the market leaders.

1333165,ICAER 2011 AGRICULTURAL PUMPING SYSTEM EFFICIENCY: Some insights obtained from field investigations.,,Mahesh Shelar and SD Bagade and GN Kulkarni,,,,,,Agricultural pumps contribute significantly to the utility demand in India. An enduse efficiency improvement of agricultural pumps has therefore remained an important policy agenda for the power policy planners. Star rating for agricultural pumps and pilot projects for replacing inefficient pumps with star rated efficient pumps are some of the policy initiatives. However end-use efficiency of agricultural pumps also depends strongly on the selection of pumps. An efficient pump wrongly selected may operate inefficiently away from its best efficiency point says the theory. Farmers select pumps based on the dealer’s advice which is based on the pump life considerations under power quality circumstances and anecdotal evidence suggests they end up selecting oversized pumps. Selecting an oversized pump should theoretically increase power consumption and hence should adversely affect the farmer as well as the utility. The authors started their investigations based on this hypothesis. The field study covered 10 farmers practicing flood irrigation. Data on the type of pump used. its rating. power availability. perceived power quality. irrigation pattern. irrigated area. well depth and pumping hours were obtained. This paper reports the findings and analysis of agricultural system pump efficiency study done with typical system loads obtained from these field studies for eight of this ten farmers practicing flood irrigation in this region. Based on the agricultural use practices obtained from the fields. the energy consumption of both the 3HP pump and the overrated 5HP pump is quantified assuming rational use of water.

1333168,ENERGY STAMPS AS A TOOL FOR EMISSION REDUCTION IN SMALL CAPACITY ENGINE SYSTEMS: A CASE STUDY FROM MAHARASHTRA,,Mahesh Shelar and SD Barahate and MR Rathi and VD Pethkar,,,,,,Kerosene is subsidized in India to address the energy accessibility issues of poor. This however has lead to the unclean practices of fuel use. Emission Reduction in cities is increasingly getting difficult because of adulterated fuel use in auto rickshaws Our study reveals that about two third of the fuel meant for cooking energy needs of the poor is diverted towards adulteration in auto rickshaws. This paper argues that effective targeting of energy subsidies through energy stamps would halt adulteration. Energy stamps are cash vouchers worth the subsidy amount gifted to poor consumers that could be exchanged for purchasing fuels at market prices while government stops subsidizing kerosene. This would stop the illegal diversion. Our analysis for a medium sized city like Nasik indicate a diversion of subsidy worth 2.5 crores per month.

1333169,Cost savings on mine dewatering pumps by reducing preparation-and comeback loads,2014,Charl Cilliers and L van der Zee and M Kleingeld,,,,1-8,IEEE,With the introduction of a time-of-use (TOU) tariff structure by Eskom. the implementation of projects that shift load from peak TOU times to times of the day when electrical energy is less expensive has increased. To enable load shifting on mine dewatering pumps. preparation before and recovery after peak TOU is needed for effective results. This induces a preparation- and comeback load in the standard TOU. With an annual increase in TOU tariffs and the rate of increase of standard TOU being greater than that of the peak TOU. a reduction in electrical energy consumption before and after peak TOU is needed. To enable this. a step-by-step control technique was developed to promote the shifting of load from standard-to off-peak TOU. while still realising a full load shift from peak TOU. This technique entails dynamic control ranges of underground dam levels as opposed to the conventional constant control range …,True,8MSNNnYAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,30,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6904166/,15167854613037163066,/scholar?cites=15167854613037163066,,,http://repository.nwu.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10394/10835/Cilliers_C.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0
1333170,Benchmarking electricity use of deep-level mines,2016,Charl Cilliers,,,,,,Electricity consumption. and the cost thereof. has become a large contributor to operating costs in deep-level mining in South Africa. Up to 60% of electricity used on deep-level mines can be attributed to five high power demand systems that continuously operate for maximum production output. Compressed air. cooling. dewatering. ventilation and hoisting systems form part of these high demand systems. The need to reduce electricity consumption of high power demand systems is identified as a means to increase mining profit. Various initiatives that aim to increase energy efficiency of high power demand systems have been implemented. However. these initiatives are often driven by external parties with no stake in mining profitability. It is important to create awareness of system performance in terms of comparative energy consumption to start focusing on identifying possible energy efficiency initiatives for mines. Numerous energy benchmarking studies have been conducted on systems ranging from commercial to industrial. The focus of these studies was on increasing energy consumption awareness and. in doing so. identifying the need to reduce energy consumption. The objective of this study is to benchmark the electricity use of deep-level mines in a new way that considers relevant external factors and variables.

Underground cooling demand also increases significantly with deeper mining activities due to high virgin rock temperatures (VRT). This study therefore focuses on the electricity usage of an ice storage system versus a chilled water system for underground cooling. A savings approach of converting an ice storage system to a chilled water system and varying the water flow through the system was thus implemented. The water flow was controlled by installing variable speed drives (VSDs) on the evaporator and condenser water pumps.

However. funding for energy saving initiatives has reduced significantly since 2013. A need therefore exists. for cost-effective energy management strategies that can be implemented in short timeframes. Upgrading existing throttle control systems on compressors is expensive. Existing compressor control is typically done using guide vanes or butterfly valves. Available cost-effective methods. such as stop-start control. have negative effects on compressors.

Cobalt-based alloys without iron are used mainly as hard materials. as their coercivities do not reach those values reached by ironbased alloys. Myung and co-workers1 showed that CoNi alloys can present HC as low as 1.3 kAm-1 (16 Oe) and MS around 1.0 T. Therefore. iron is still a critical component for soft magnetic materials. as Co-based alloys coercivity are not suitable for future soft magnetic materials.

1333189,Síntese e caracterização microestrutural. superficial e eletroquímica de óxido de estanho dopado com haletos,2004,Marcos Cramer Esteves,,,,,,Os eletrodos de metais nobres. considerados os melhores. implicam em altos custos para qualquer tipo de aplicação em larga escala. Com intuito de minimizar os custos e manter a eficiência. muitos estudos buscam materiais alternativos. O óxido de estanho apresenta-se como uma boa alternativa para material de eletrodo. principalmente por poder ser utilizado na forma de filme condutor transparente. Atualmente. é aplicado em sensores eletroquímicos para detecção de gases. painéis de cristal líquido e em células fotovoltaicas. Como se trata de um semicondutor. é comum o uso de dopantes para melhorar a condutividade elétrica do composto. Entre os diversos dopantes já estudados. o flúor apresenta resultados muito bons. sendo um dos mais utilizados hoje em dia. Entretanto. pouco se sabe sobre como esse aditivo influi sobre as características físico-químicas do óxido de estanho. A proposta do presente trabalho é estudar a influência do uso de haletos (F e Cl) como aditivos para o óxido de estanho. Inicialmente. foram preparados pós de SnO2 com diferentes concentrações de flúor ou cloro. através do método de precursores poliméricos. Esses pós foram caracterizados por difração de raios X. reflectância difusa de infravermelho e medidas de área superficial através de isoterma BET. Os resultados obtidos mostram que os aditivos concentram-se no contorno de grão. As amostras dopadas sofreram aumento de área superficial e mudança no espectro IV da superfície. Os padrões de difração de raios-X permaneceram inalterados. indicando que não houve formação de solução sólida ou qualquer outro tipo de alteração no retículo …,True,t0ou88kAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,0,https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/46/46132/tde-23082016-175309/en.php,,,,,https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/46/46132/tde-23082016-175309/publico/Marcos_Cramer_Esteves_Mestrado.pdf,0,0,0

1333192,INFLUÊNCIA DA ADIÇÃO DE FLÚOR NAS PROPRIEDADES NANOESTRUTURAIS DE PÓS À BASE DE SnO2 PREPARADOS PELO MÉTODO PECHINI.,,MC Esteves and PTA Sumodjo and D Gouvêa,,,,,,A modificação da superfície de pós cerâmicos é responsável por várias mudanças nas propriedades do material. Controle do tamanho de grão. densidade de carga superficial e mudança do comportamento com o meio são algumas das possibilidades que surgem com a inclusão de aditivos A adição de cátions. em geral metais de transição. é a mais comum. Através de técnicas como espectroscopia no infravermelho. determinação da área superficial. difração de raios-X e mobilidade dinâmica eletrocinética. foi possível estudar o efeito do flúor sobre as características de pós a base de SnO2 preparados via precursor polimérico (baseado no método Pechini). Os resultados mostram que com adição de não mais que 10%(mol) de F a área superficial aumenta. o potencial isoelétrico é deslocado para valores mais ácidos e a adsorção de água passa a ser menor. A difração de raios-X mostra que não há formação de segunda fase. Sendo assim. o aditivo está segregando na superfície dos grãos. Comprovando tal fato. a espectroscopia no infravermelho mostra modificação nas bandas relativas às hidroxilas adsorvidas na superfície.

In those of a more complex nature whose principal players may belong to either the same or a different firm a different form of organization is required: one which coherently defines rules and resources designed to avoid. in conditions of uncertainty. tensions arising between the different players which prevent their coordination. In this essay. the hypothesis that such organizations require both contract and leadership will be presented and discussed. The contract is required to en-sure ex-post efficiency. avoiding wastage of resources. and ex-ante efficiency. i.e. mutual commitment between the different players in the innovative process. Leadership is required to progressively manage the conflicts that occur between contrasting visions of how best to proceed that emerge from different specializations. legitimized through a shared commitment. Notwithstanding such characterization. leadership may also not assume the same functions of contract. The contract may not be sufficient and require leadership. but strong leadership cannot replace contract. In such a case. there would be a risk of disengagement.

1333229,Approaches to Optimize Uzbekistan’s Investment in Irrigation Technologies,2020,Michael Brody and Bahtiyor Eshchanov and Alexander Golub,15,Экономическая политика,2,136–147,,For many decades. Uzbekistan has been one of the largest cotton producers in the world. The irrigation water needed for these high production levels has been delivered by the massive diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. which naturally flowed into the Aral Sea. This diversion for agriculture was the main cause of the rapid decline of the Aral Sea. which is at only 10% of its original size today. The traditional method of irrigation. which relies on simple open canal systems. is highly inefficient for managing the region’s critical and limited water resource. It has been qualitatively estimated. for example. that irrigation water lost to evaporation and system inefficiencies is quite large. With the future availability of water at risk for agriculture in Central Asia. primarily due to the loss of glacial volume from global warming. along with declines in seasonal snowpack. it is clear that new approaches to water management are needed. Any serious efforts to restore the Aral Sea and its ecological services would also reduce supplies of irrigation water for Uzbekistan. While regional conflict over water is unlikely. it must be considered since Uzbekistan is a downstream country among several that rely on the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for most of their water supplies. To insure against these risks to cotton production and the underlying economy. better irrigation technologies are needed across Uzbekistan. However. these technologies can be quite expensive. especially given that water is still nearly free.

1333239,Uzbekistan: Quality Job Creation as a Cornerstone for Sustainable Economic Growth,2020,Kym Anderson and Edimon Ginting and Kiyoshi Taniguchi,,,,,Asian Development Bank,Uzbekistan has achieved sustained growth through its gradual transition to a market-based economy through cautious economic policy reforms. Despite its gradual approach to development challenges. the country experienced the smallest output decline among former Soviet economies and enjoyed high rates of economic growth from 2004 to 2015. largely driven by the high prices of its major export commodities. However. the drop in the global prices of many key commodities in recent years have severely impacted Uzbekistan's economy. Under these circumstances. the new government introduced major reforms. The pace of reform is unprecedented. The government has formulated its long-term economic strategy in its Vision 2030. which aims to double the country's gross domestic product by 2030 through a program of economic diversification. This book analyzes how Uzbekistan can boost sustainable economic growth to create more and better jobs. It considers how the country can consolidate achievements from recent policy reforms and maintain reform efforts to accelerate sustainable growth. Policy recommendations cover fostering macroeconomic stability. increasing investment in physical infrastructure. enhancing human capital. improving firms' access to finance. and lowering barriers to international trade and foreign investment inflows.,True,4oKJbIwAAAAJ:4OULZ7Gr8RgC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7322055202324382670&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,https://think-asia.org/bitstream/handle/11540/12023/uzbekistan-job-creation-economic-growth.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

The trout oil and its blends (B10. B20. B40 and B50) were tested in a single-cylinder natural aspirated indirect injection diesel engine. The tests showed significant changes in engine’s power and particularly torque as well as major improvements in the engine emission for B40 and B50 in general. except the increasing of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission due to high combustion temperature resulted by better combustion process. The brake specific fuel consumption of B50 fuel was almost the same as that of diesel fuel at the maximum torque and rated power conditions.

The complete engine cycle process (inlet. compression. expansion and exhaust strokes) in gasoline engine model was investigated using RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) and CFM (Coherent Flame Model) approaches offered by Star-CD/es-ice. Simulations were done for the compression ratio 8: 1 and 1200 rpm engine speed. C8H18 (iso-octane) was used as the engine fuel. In the numerical simulations to model turbulent flow field. k-ε RNG turbulence model was selected with Angelberger wall functions. Static spark advance was set at 20 CA bTDC during the simulations. Fluid flow in the cylinder was observed during all the engine strokes. Especially. just before the exhaust valve open. some numerical abnormal situations were detected. It was observed that the pressure and temperature gradients between cylinder and exhaust port caused these abnormalities at small exhaust valve lifts. Temperature distribution. velocity profiles. burnt-unburnt fuel concentrations were obtained. Courant and Mach numbers were investigated in details at the exhaust stroke. Also global engine parameters such as in cylinder pressure. temperature and heat release rates were plotted. It was observed that CFM combustion model predicts faster flame propagation speed compared to experimental ones. Due to that higher temperature and peak pressure values were obtained in the numerical simulations.,True,OIJ6fUcAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,12,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f206/0da0c9d7fb776d622fb113d49029a80d3084.pdf,16980915373671306215,/scholar?cites=16980915373671306215,,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f206/0da0c9d7fb776d622fb113d49029a80d3084.pdf,0,0,0

The effect of ventilation velocity on the fire is examined. Fire experiments are simulated by burning 10 ml isopropyl alcohol fuel in a fire pool with dimensions 5cm x 10cm x 4 mm at the center of 1/100 scaled underground station model. A commercial CFD program FLUENT was used in numerical simulations. For air flow simulations. k-ω SST turbulence model and for combustion simulation. non-premixed combustion model are used. This study showed that. the ventilation velocity is increased from 1 m/s to 3 m/s the maximum temperature in the station is found to be less for ventilation velocity of 1 m/s. The reason for these experimental result lies on the relative dominance of oxygen supply effect on cooling effect. Without piston effect. maximum temperature occurs above the fuel pool. However. when the ventilation velocity increased the flame was tilted in the direction of ventilation and the location of maximum temperature moves along the flow direction. The velocities measured experimentally in the station at different locations are well matched by the CFD simulation results. The prediction of general flow pattern is satisfactory with the smoke visualization tests. The backlayering in velocity is well predicted by CFD simulation. However. all over the station. the CFD simulations predicted higher temperatures compared to experimental measurements.,True,OIJ6fUcAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,9,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.306.5849&rep=rep1&type=pdf,13242472579211668948,/scholar?cites=13242472579211668948,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.306.5849&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Enough turbulence formations will result in a better mixing process of air and fuel and it will also enhance flame development. The desired turbulent character can be obtained with a well designed intake port. In this study. swirl and tumble motion investigations were performed for Ricardo E6 Research Engine. The CAD model of the engine cylinder with only intake port and intake valve was prepared and imported to STAR-CCM+ v6. 04 software. The energy solver was frozen and segregated solver was used during the solutions. The turbulence model selection was a key point for such an analysis. So. three turbulence models (Realizable ks. k-ro-SST and LES) were compared. The ks model was found more suitable and stable for these cases. In our investigation. there were two case studies. One of them was effect of valve lift change on swirl and tumble number while the engine was operated constant speed. The second one was effect of engine speed on swirl and tumble number for a unique valve lift. As it is expected for a gasoline engine. the tumble numbers remain higher than swirl numbers. The valve lift change results showed that while increasing of valve lift increased the swirl numbers but decreased the tumble numbers. This inversely proportional result arises from the momentum transform between the angular and axial motions. Anyway. both dimensionless numbers were increased with the engine speed increasing and it was seen that the engine speed is the most effective parameter for incylinder flow formation,True,OIJ6fUcAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,0,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/fce/issue/29250/313154,,,,,https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/303210,0,0,0

In the first part performance tests of commercial TEGs were performed. An electric resistance was used to model the heat source for hot side of TEG. For heat sink side water is circulated in a closed system. which enables constant water temperature at the outlet. The voltage of the resistance was controlled by a variac to obtain different heat source temperatures. Due to this purpose a specially designed water channel for the cold surface was manufactured. The force between TEG and heat source/sink was achieved by two screws on both sides of the module. A thermal paste was applied to the hot and cold surfaces of TEGs to minimize the contact resistance.

Petroleum-based fuels are obtained from limited reserves. These finite reserves are highly concentrated in certain regions of the world. Hence. it is necessary to look for alternative fuels which can be produced from resources available orally within the country such as alcohol. biodiesel. vegetable and animal fat oils etc. In this study. usability of trout oil biodiesel–diesel fuel blends as an alternative fuel for diesel engines were studied. Biodiesel was produced by reacting trout oil with methyl alcohol determined at optimum condition. The trout oil biodiesel–diesel fuel blends were tested in a single cylinder indirect injection (IDI) diesel engine. Engine exhaust emission values were measured at different load condition. It was seen that CO emissions decreased to approximately 27% and HC emissions decreased to 42% with the blended fuel B50 but NOx emissions increased up to with the all new fuel blends. These results were compared with diesel fuel values.,True,OIJ6fUcAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,http://mech-ing.com/journal/Archive/2010/8-9/4_35_Salih.t-m10.pdf,,,,,http://mech-ing.com/journal/Archive/2010/8-9/4_35_Salih.t-m10.pdf,0,0,0

However. with increasing production from non-conventional reservoirs. the stability and effectiveness of traditional drilling fluids under high temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environment have become big concerns. Both water and oil based drilling fluids are likely to experience a number of deteriorations such as gelation. degradation of weighting materials and breakdown of polymeric additives under HTHP conditions. Recently. nanotechnology has shown a lot of promise in the oil and gas sectors. including nanoparticle-based drilling fluids. This paper aims to explore and assess the influence of various nanoparticles on the performance of drilling fluids to make the drilling operation smooth. cost effective and efficient. In order to achieve this aim. the article will begin by explaining the important role that drilling fluid plays during the drilling process with a historical review of drilling fluid industry development.

The global dependence on fossil fuels is very high and the need for reducing our energy consumption in line with mitigating the greenhouse gasses emissions is compelling. With the current global reduction of oil prices. companies or even governments tend to import more energy due to economic reasons. For instance. recently. DHL which is a famous company providing international express delivery. introduced a helicopter express delivery in London. Such development gives a real indication that as people/agencies consume more fossil fuels. in fact. the world become closer to the reserves ending point. Accordingly. this makes renewables deployment and hence reducing energy cost is quite difficult.

1333297,Understanding the lubrication mechanisms of ionic liquids when used as additives or as neat lubricants,2019,Waleed Tareq Ibrahim Al-Sallami,,,,,,The promising properties of ionic liquids have attracted many tribologists to use them as lubricants. They have been used as either neat lubricants or as anti-wear additives. The results show that ionic liquids reacted/adsorbed with the lubricated surfaces and form a protective layer (tribofilm). A large number of previous studies have examined the tribological performance of ionic liquids. However. the relationship between the tribological performance and ionic liquids’ chemistry is still not fully understood. The previous studies focused on the suggestion of various ionic liquids as lubricants and study their tribological behaviour. The effect of ionic liquids’ chemistry. including anion and cation chain lengths. anion type and cation type. on their lubrication mechanism is still not fully understood. This lack of knowledge is the motivation to conduct the first part of this study (using neat ionic liquids as lubricants). In terms of effective anti-wear additives. Zinc Dialkyl Dithio Phosphate (ZDDP) is one of the most common. However. the production of ash when it is decomposed and the emission of harmful gases push researchers to identify alternatives which can provide comparable anti-wear performance. Therefore. ashless additives are proposed as anti-wear additives instead of ZDDP. Soluble ILs are also suggested to be an effective alternative to ZDDP. especially when lubricating light alloys. Phosphonium phosphate (PP) ionic liquid is oil-soluble. Recent studies showed that this ionic liquid provided a superior anti-wear performance than ZDDP at some conditions (high temperature and sliding distance over 40 m). However. the reason behind this superior …,True,Z2FK3JgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.804533,,,,,,0,0,0

This paper discusses the effort to analyze the current core loading of the PSBR by the MCNP5 code. Since the initially loaded fresh fuel has been depleted due to the long operation history of the PSBR. the fuel material composition of each fuel element is needed to be determined in order to model the current PSBR core. The HELIOS code was used in this research to obtain the fuel material composition change of each fuel element. In addition. the decay calculation was introduced to the PSBR core model by the ORIGEN2. 2 code to take into account of the effect of the Xe135 decay after reactor shutdown. The X135 decay was found to have a significant impact on the core excess reactivity.

It is currently the longest operating research reactor in the United States. The initial reactor design used plate-‐type materials testing reactor (MTR) fuel elements with a 61-‐cm active fuel length and up to 93% uranium enrichment. Seven beam ports were built into the facility design for analyzing the nuclear properties of materials. determining reactor dynamics. and examining the effects of radiation on materials. After ten years of service. the reactor core design was changed to a TRIGA Mark III. The design conversion to a TRIGA core produced three major advantages for the reactor:(1) the reactor power was increased from 200 kW to 1 MW;(2) the reactor used fuel in the low-‐enriched safeguards category since TRIGAs use fuel that is 20% enriched in uranium. and (3) pulsing capability was added to the core due to the inherent prompt negative feedback characteristics of the TRIGA fuel elements. which are a matrix of uranium and ZrH1. 6 moderators. Unfortunately. the design conversion also resulted in a partial loss of experimental capability for the facility. such that use of six of the seven beam ports became limited. This is mainly due to the physical differences between MTR and TRIGA fuel element designs. Since the active length of a TRIGA fuel element (38.1 cm) is considerably smaller than the active length of an MTR fuel element (~ 61 cm). six beam ports. which were aligned with the MTR fuel. are now directed 12.7 or 27.9 cm below the core center.

Melt wires or paint spots are often included in such tests as an independent technique of detecting peak temperatures incurred during irradiation. In addition. less expensive static capsule tests. which have no leads attached for real-time data transmission. often rely on melt wires and paint spots as a post-irradiation technique for peak temperature indication. Unfortunately. these techniques are limited in that they can only detect whether a single temperature is or is not exceeded. Silicon carbide (SiC) monitors are advantageous because a single monitor can be used to determine the peak temperature reached within a relatively broad range (200 – 800°C).

1333315,Thermal-‐Hydraulics Analysis of A New Core-‐Moderator Assembly Design for the Penn State Breazeale Reactor Using the ANSYS Fluent Code,2014,D Uçar and K Ünlü and BJ Heidrich,,,,,,The Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR). a TRIGA Mark-‐III design. is an open-‐pool type reactor that is cooled by the natural circulation of the demineralized and filtered water. The reactor core operates at a depth of~ 5.5 m (18 ft) in the reactor pool. which has dimensions of 9.14 m in length. 4.27 m in width and 7.21 m in depth. and at a pressure of~ 1.5 atm. The driving force for the natural circulation of the water is the heat generation within the fuel rods. The PSBR operates in the subcooled nucleate boiling region above 250 kW power since the temperature of the fuel rod outer is sufficiently higher than the saturation temperature of the water at the reactor’s local operating pressure. Additionally. the reactor is licensed for two modes of operation:(1) the normal mode of operation with up to 1 MW nominal power and(2) the pulse mode of operation with up to 2000 MW and a pulse half width of 10 to 20 msec.The PSBR has some inherent design issues that limit the experimental capability of the facility. such that only two of the seven available neutron beam ports can be coupled with the reactor core for experimental purposes. In addition. neutron beams in the available beam ports have a severe prompt gamma-‐ray component because of the current configuration of the core and the moderator tank. The limitations of the existing reactor have been discussed and analyzed in several studies [1][2][3] and the major problem was identified as the existing core-‐moderator assembly configuration [4]. Thus. a new-‐core moderator assembly has been designed and analyzed for the reactor to overcome these design problems and to increase the neutronic …,True,aeiYeCEAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,1,https://www.rsec.psu.edu/assets/PDF/12-RSEC%20Book_Ucar%20Thermal%20Hydraulics.pdf,3778102660391726291,/scholar?cites=3778102660391726291,,,https://www.rsec.psu.edu/assets/PDF/12-RSEC%20Book_Ucar%20Thermal%20Hydraulics.pdf,0,0,0

High-purity silicon carbide (SiC) can be used to provide such data through post-irradiation material analysis. This method stems from radiation defect concentrations’ dependence on irradiation temperature. Irradiation temperature can be determined by measuring irradiation-induced property changes. for example lattice spacing distribution. dimensions. electrical resistivity. etc.—after isochronal annealing. Such methods are time-consuming. since multiple steps must be performed in a serial manner. We investigated the possibility of using an alternative method that does not require multiple heat treatments.

1333361,Potential and Challenges of ORC driven Heat Pumps Based on Gas Bearing Supported Turbomachinery,2018,Violette Mounier,,,THESIS,,EPFL,Nowadays. domestic space heating accounts for more than 16% of the worldwide primary energy consumption. Electrically Driven Heat Pumps (EDHPs) have been identified as a key technology to provide energy savings in this sector. However. since EDHPs require electrical power. issues related to network overload at peak-time and high operating costs occur more and more. Furthermore. depending on the local energy mix. EDHPs may have a high electricity carbon intensity. particularly when the electricity is generated from fossil fuels. A promising alternative to address these shortcomings is the use of Thermally Driven Heat Pumps (TDHPs). which are powered by a heat source instead of electricity. TDHPs offer the possibility of running with numerous types of heat sources. even renewable ones. Typical TDHP systems are absorption heat pumps. ejectors. and gas engine driven heat pumps. An alternative technical option is to combine a bottoming vapor compression Heat Pump cycle (HP) with a topping Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) in which the ORC turbine drives directly the HP compressor. This system configuration is named ORC driven Heat Pump (HP-ORC). This technology provides flexibility regarding the selection of the thermal energy source while offering the possibility of producing electricity (cogeneration).

1333365,Understanding comfort and senses in social practice theory: Insights from a Danish field study,2017,Line Valdorff Madsen and Kirsten Gram-Hanssen,29,Energy Research & Social Science,,86-94,Elsevier,Thermal comfort is central to energy consumption in housing and one of the main drivers behind worldwide GHG emissions. Research on residential energy consumption has therefore addressed comfort in relation to indoor temperatures. This paper argues that by widening the focus of comfort to include other aspects such as air. light and materials. more sustainable ideas of residential comfort might be developed. The paper takes a practice theoretical perspective but argues that the senses should be better incorporated into the approach to understand different aspects of comfort.

This development influences everyday practices related to comfort in everyday life in dwellings. Therefore. an empirical analysis of interviews with residents in three types of Danish detached houses. related to the building age. is used to understand how changes in technologies influence residents’ practices and notions of comfort. Detached houses are the most widespread type of housing in Denmark. constituting 44% of the housing stock. The analysis focuses on differences in heating systems between the housing types and shows how changes in technologies and material structures shape the practices of heating and airing.

1333372,Energy consumption in the comfortable home: Practices. perceptions and conventions,2017,Line Valdorff Madsen,,,,,Aalborg Universitetsforlag,With scholars announcing the geological shift from the age of the Holocene to the age of the Anthropocene (Crutzen 2002). human influence on the changing climate of the planet has. even if not already. been clearly stated. Consumption of goods and energy is ever rising and is challenging the human response to ongoing climate changes and the need to reduce carbon emissions and our dependency on fossil fuels. A great part of this consumption takes place in the everyday life of citizens in the Western world through performing activities in dwellings. enmeshed in socio-technical systems. as noted by Shove and colleagues:”(…) the bulk of consumption is embedded in relatively inconspicuous routines occasioned by the characteristically mundane socio-technical systems of everyday life”(Shove et al. 2007. 10).This ‘ordinary consumption’(Gronow and Warde 2001) implies a great amount of energy consumed through daily routines. Energy consumption is thus seen as the consumption of energy through practices to provide heat. cooling and light. for example. as well to the services provided by the wealth of household appliances that are used to sustain daily life in homes (Warde 2005; Shove and Walker 2014). As one type of answer to this. are the many visions of the future smart everyday life: living in smart homes. driving smart cars and using smart gadgets to control the everyday lives of citizens including their daily energy consumption. Such visions often rely on smart technologies that can control. for example. the heating or cooling of houses. and furthermore on a technologically capable and rational consumer (Strengers 2013; Wilhite …,True,JeGBf8YAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/258232866/PHD_Line_Valdorff_Madsen_E_pdf.pdf,,,,,https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/258232866/PHD_Line_Valdorff_Madsen_E_pdf.pdf,0,0,0

Furthermore a point of departure of the thesis has been a critical view. with roots in critical geography. on ideals of housing. family life and the discourses of planning in relation to this.Overall the interviewed residents express positive experiences with living in co-‐housing. One central conclusion is that co-‐housing offers. for the interviewees. an alternative way of practising their everyday life. as the everyday life in the examined co-‐housing is structured around practising everyday routines jointly. The most central one of these joint everyday routines is the common meal. which can be said to form a meeting point in the everyday life.

This study uses numerical and experimental analyses to investigate the reduction in the operating temperature of PV panels with an air-cooled heat sink. The proposed heat sink was designed as an aluminum plate with perforated fins that is attached to the back of the PV panel. A comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was conducted using the software ANSYS Fluent to ensure that the heat sink model worked properly. The influence of heat sinks on the heat transfer between a PV panel and the circulating ambient air was investigated. The results showed a substantial decrease in the operating temperature of the PV panel and an increase in its electrical performance. The CFD analysis in the heat sink model with an air flow velocity of 1.5 m/s and temperature of 35°C under a heat flux of 1000 W/m2 showed a decrease in the PV panel’s average temperature from 85.3°C to 72.8°C. As a consequence of decreasing its temperature. the heat sink increased the open-circuit photovoltage () and maximum power point () of the PV panel by 10% and 18.67%. respectively. Therefore. the use of aluminum heat sinks could provide a potential solution to prevent PV panels from overheating and may indirectly lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions due to the increased electricity production from the PV system.,True,vWVX2sIAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C,14,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,11063058355765537488,/scholar?cites=11063058355765537488,,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijp/2020/1574274/,0,0,0

France,,Yongfeng Qu and Maya Milliez and Luc Musson-Genon and Bertrand Carissimo,,,,,,City residents are subjected to modified thermal environments as well as increased air pollution. In order to better understand the phenomena occurring at urban scale and to study different scenarios more and more realistic simulation tools are developed. Nevertheless. many micrometeorological studies on flow and pollution dispersion assume a neutral atmosphere and most building energy balance models neglect the three-dimensional local variation of the flow and temperature fields. The aim of this work is to develop a three dimensional tool coupling thermal energy balance of the buildings and modelling of the atmospheric flow in urban areas. We have developed a threedimensional microscale atmospheric radiative scheme in the atmospheric module of the 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Code_Saturne adapted to complex geometry. In our simulations. we use a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach with a k-ε turbulence closure. The full coupling of the radiative transfer and fluid dynamics models has been validated with idealized cases. In this work. we simulate surface temperatures of a district of the city of Toulouse. in the South-West part of France. taking into account the 3D effects of the flow around the buildings. in real meteorological conditions.

It is shown that conventional ESD test methods for failure detection. like current and voltage waveforms during ESD stress and direct current leakage are insufficient for MEMS. A functionality-based approach using the mechanical response of the MEMS during ESD is needed to accurately and conclusively detect ESD failure in MEMS. A novel test setup with a probe-mountable human body model (HBM) tester is presented for this purpose. This setup can perform simultaneous measurements of MEMS out-of-plane displacement. HBM current and HBM voltage in the MEMS in situ during ESD stress.

The first one is to investigate the sensitivity of MEMS to ESD stress events thereby answering the question how big a threat ESD is to the reliability of MEMS. ESD is one of the newer and less understood problems in MEMS technology. with little published literature at the start of this thesis work. as compared to better-studied issues like creep. fatigue. charging. stiction etc. This has motivated the largely experimental and exploratory work performed in the framework of this PhD. The work involved setting up test procedures and failure criteria for ESD testing in MEMS. measuring the sensitivity levels and understanding unique failure mechanisms in MEMS during ESD stress. The investigations are performed on two main electrostatically actuated MEMS test vehicles the torsional micromirror and the capacitive RF MEMS switch. and a few other related test structures. The second objective is to propose solutions for better ESD reliability of MEMS. This has been achieved either by improving the intrinsic ESD robustness through better ESD-aware MEMS design or by implementing on-chip ESD protection strategies. Both CMOS and MEMS-based ESD protection solutions are explored in the context of both CMOS-integrated and stand-alone MEMS applications. A MEMS device can typically be subjected to ESD during many stages of its production like processing. assembly. packaging. shipping and handling. and even during normal operation. Unlike semiconductor ICs. MEMS have movable components separated by air-gaps. As a consequence. two effects can occur during an ESD event.

The position and chromophore structure affected the acidity of the urea and amide hydrogens in the order 4>3>2>1. All the spectroscopic studies showed a significant change of 1 and 2 compared with 3 and 4 in the presence of different TBAX salts in acetonitrile. The 1H-NMR spectra show a preferential interaction of the anions with the urea group in receptors 1 and 2 due to the less steric hindrance. while there is a cooperative interaction of amide group in receptors 3 and 4 due to the closeness of both groups.,True,DSgQwoIAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,4,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10610278.2017.1350676,18410348183169520298,/scholar?cites=18410348183169520298,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Ochoa-Teran/publication/318463812_Synthesis_and_anion_recognition_studies_of_new_ureylbenzamide-based_receptors/links/59d51574aca2725954c44b2f/Synthesis-and-anion-recognition-studies-of-new-ureylbenzamide-based-receptors.pdf,0,0,0

The study was targeted to the complexing capacity of five metal ions (Fe 2+. Cu 2+. Cd 2+. Hg 2+ and Pb 2+) of environmental concern as the medullar principle of a liquid phase sensor for its application in the determination of these metal ions due to its versatility of use. Molecular fluorescence. UV-visible and Zeta potential were measured for five BOABs and the effect of alkyl groups with different central chain length (n= 3. 4. 6. 8 and 10) on physicochemical performance determined. The results have shown that these derivatives present higher sensibility and selectivity for Cu 2+ even in the presence of the other metal ions. An additional application test was done adding a pectin (0.1 wt%) solution to the BOAB-Cu+ 2 complex to obtain a precipitate (flocs) as a potential selective separation process of Cu from aqueous solution. The solid was then lyophilized and analyzed by SEM-EDS. the images showed spheric forms containing Cu+ 2 with diameter of approximately of 8 μm and 30 wt%.

1333465,Analysis and assessment of flexibility in multi-energy systems,2017,Adrien Saint-Pierre,,,,,,The rapidly growing global energy demand creates unprecedented challenges to meet the ambitious environmental targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Even though coal and natural gas still account for the major share of primary energy consumption in the power sector. the share of renewable. but intermittent. energy sources is increasing rapidly. This trend is creating a grand challenge in the power sector as on the one hand. increased flexibility is needed to foster for the integration of renewables while. on the other hand. the relevant flexible units would reduce opportunities for less flexible but more efficient Low Carbon Technologies (LCTs) such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).In light of the above. it is vital to identify alternative sources of flexibility. An attractive option is to look beyond the power sector and into the multi-energy paradigm. This provides new sources of flexibility as (i) technologies from different sectors can now be coupled to increase their technical. environmental and economic performance (eg. exploiting heat from cogeneration to support CCS) and (ii) energy surplus and shortage issues introduced by intermittent generation can be tackled through the use of different energy sources (eg. Power-to-Gas and Power-to-Heat). This thesis proposes new methodologies to analyse and assess flexibility in multienergy systems at both generation and distribution levels. The first contribution is the development of a model that optimises the operation of flexible CCS coalfired cogeneration plants in a volatile market environment.

Because of these fundamental properties of transmission. the importance of developing tools and models to assist power system planning under uncertainty has long been recognized. As any decision under uncertainty is made before the uncertainty is revealed. addressing uncertainties allows hedging against risks caused by the outcomes of decisions taken under uncertainty.,True,i6dpXbkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,19,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7491423/,9760362821292599131,/scholar?cites=9760362821292599131,,,,0,0,0

Climate variability is partly predictable and is a fundamental factor in explaining financial risk in renewable energy projects. Current methodologies used for risk assessment do not appropriately account for climate predictability. We found limited literature on risk reduction on PV projects through the modeling of predictable components of solar radiation and ocean-atmospheric oscillations. allowing us to present original proposals to fill these voids. A new profit model for PV plants was developed. capturing this predictable climate information. The proposed methodology is potentially applicable to hydro. wind and other renewable resources. and allows leaving aside predictable climate components from the project’s risk calculation.

A power crisis has also become a perennial development challenge in Ghana. with increasing severity that threatens the country’s economic growth and transformation. The troubling rationing system. the slowdown in industrial activity. job and income losses. and disruptions in social life are telling reminders of what now seems a perennial drag on Ghana’s development agenda. While Ghana has committed itself to universal electricity access by 2020. the real challenge is the capacity to meet this goal and. most important. to ensure that supply is reliable and adequate.

The study applied the vector error correction model (VECM) to estimate the long-run and short-run determinants of crude oil demand in Ghana within the study period. The long-run estimates reveal that price of crude oil. real GDP per capita. real effective exchange rate and energy saving technical progress are significant long-run determinants of crude oil demand. The results also indicate that crude oil demand in Ghana is income and price inelastic. Crude oil price has a positive long-run effect indicating the virtual lack of substitutes and overdependence on crude oil for energy generation and economic activities in Ghana.

The sector is estimated to create about 8 million direct jobs. which in turn support over 45 million Africans. 1 It is labelled as a poverty-driven activity because of its ability to provide mostly impoverished people with a source of direct employment and create additional jobs. especially in rural areas where there are few alternative livelihoods. The sector. however. has mostly been associated with negative social. economic. political. and environmental consequences. The informal. unregulated nature of much of the ASM activities makes it vulnerable to illegal dealings and an easy victim of organised crime. paramilitary operations. widespread corruption and violence. especially in highly valued minerals like gold. coltan. tin. tungsten (collectively known as conflict minerals). and diamonds. In many cases. ASM has indirectly incited political violence. Rebel groups have used revenues and profits from conflict minerals to finance political violence in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). the Central African Republic.

Policymakers face challenges. including limited budgets and incomplete information about the effectiveness of the various policy options in their specific situation. in crafting and executing policy that supports market development goals. Recent work investigated the effect of the order in which policies are implemented (referred to as' policy stacking') and the presence of low-cost enabling policies. such as interconnection standards and net metering. can have on the success of states in promoting PV markets. Findings indicate that implementation of interconnection standards and policy related to the valuation of excess electricity (eg. net metering). along with indicators of long term government support for a solar PV market (eg. RPS) and a non-policy determinant (population). explain about 70% of the variation among states in new PV capacity.

1333496,STATE POLICY STAGING TO OPTIMIZE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES,,Elizabeth Doris and Vitaliy Krasko and Darlene Steward,,,,,,Understanding how policies encourage private investment in the development of solar markets is critical to optimizing implementation of cost-effective state-level policies. This report summarizes a statistical analysis of state policy effectiveness. and while acknowledging the complexities of the relationships. includes the following major findings: 1) market preparation policies that have low costs for state and local governments. interconnection and net metering for example. are correlated with private investment in markets; 2) low-cost policies that align with established best practices for distributed generation support are statistically linked to states with higher PV penetration; and 3) well designed market preparation policies seem to bolster the effectiveness of more expensive policies. In addition. the paper provides an overview of current efforts to further explore the effect of low-cost-enabling policies. The study normalizes for resource and demographic factors that affect solar installations regardless of which policies are implemented. Results to date suggest that specific policy pathways can be effective for streamlined market development in various state economic and demographic environments.,True,oXH6MFsAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,http://proceedings.ases.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SOLAR2013_0134_final-paper.pdf,,,,,http://proceedings.ases.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SOLAR2013_0134_final-paper.pdf,0,0,0
