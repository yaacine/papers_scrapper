We know that they can and do aggregate; they give complex structures. and by doing so they acquire new properties—functions that may not be apparent from a study of the individual components. This review is about molecular aggregates of a certain sort. namely. those that assemble and more or less completely surround other molecules. Taking part in this intimacy imparts unique properties to the participants. and new functions emerge from the aggregate as a whole. For the most part. we emphasize self‐complementary structures. Their ability to assemble—an expression of the molecule's desire to be something more than it is—results from instructions engineered into the molecules during their creation.,True,lKkLdHIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1026,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1521-3773(20020503)41:9%3C1488::AID-ANIE1488%3E3.0.CO;2-G,13400509848817168552,/scholar?cites=13400509848817168552,,http://nuckolls.chem.columbia.edu/system/files/109/original/5_Molecular_Encapsulation.pdf,0,0,0

The structural basis for this selectivity. which involves occupancy of a small hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the aromatic cage. was confirmed through molecular dynamics simulations.

This dual function is necessary for the transcriptional and chromatin remodelling activities of the NuRD (nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase) complex.

The maximal formulation attempts to use the Hund's rule as a general ordering principle for any configuration. Experimentally. Hund's rule is highly reliable so far as the ground state is concerned.

The most restrictive formulation of Hund's rule states that in a configuration of equivalent electrons the deepest lying term corresponds to the highest possible value of the total spin.

1124264,Concerning the chemical potential of few‐electron systems,1981,Jacob Katriel and Robert G Parr and Marc R Nyden,74,The Journal of Chemical Physics,4,2397-2401,American Institute of Physics,We examine the implications of a theoretical framework which assume a continuous dependence of atomic (molecular) energies on the number of electrons. Although this function E(Z.N) has discontinuous slopes in the limit as Z approaches infinity with N finite. it is shown that one can formulate a representation of E(Z.N) which is analytic for finite Z and has the appropriate limiting behavior. Assuming analyticity. for one‐electron systems there is derived a formula for the chemical potential μ(1)=E(1)+(∂C/∂N)N=1. where C is the electron repulsion energy. From numerical data it is argued that (∂C/∂N)N=1 is nonzero for one‐electron systems and that C is negative for N<1. The formula for the chemical potential is used in an empirical fit of atomic energies and to clarify a recently proposed definition of atoms in molecules.,True,vkCF2EoAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC,48,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.441360,1983383897798040224,/scholar?cites=1983383897798040224,,,0,0,0

The signature of this excess specific heat is a peak observed in C/T 3 versus T. To understand the curious absence of long-range ordering of local distortions in the crystal structure of pyrochlore Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7. we have measured the specific heat of crystalline Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 and related compounds. We find that the peak in C/T 3 versus T in Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 falls at a substantially lower temperature than other similar compounds consistent with the presence of disorder. This thermodynamic evidence for disorder in crystalline Bi 2 Ti 2 O 7 is consistent with quenched configurational disorder among Bi lone pairs produced by the geometrical frustration. which could represent a possible realization of “charge ice.”,True,XghiRcYAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,44,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.79.224111,3768280811131453011,/scholar?cites=3768280811131453011,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0904.1582,0,0,0

Ge exhibits the lowest formation energy. whereas Ga has the largest one. Ga‐ and As‐doped graphene display a reactivity that is larger than that corresponding to a double vacancy. They can decompose H2 and O2 easily. Variation of the type and concentration of dopant makes the adjustment of the interlayer interaction possible. In general. doping of monolayer graphene opens a band gap. At some concentrations. Ga doping induces a half metallic behavior. As is the element that offers the widest range of gap tuning. Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof calculations indicate that it can be varied from 1.3 to 0.3 eV. For bilayer graphene. the doped sheet induces charge redistribution in the perfect underneath sheet. which opens a gap in the range of 0.05–0.4 eV.

To study the addition of free radicals and 1.3 dipolar cycloadditions. we employed periodic DFT calculations. In all cases lithium increases the reactivity. even though the effect is weaker for the 1.3 dipolar cycloaddition as compared with that exhibited by free radicals. The effect of lithium doping is local and decreases as the functional group is attached far from the lithium atom. The increased reactivity can be explained by analyzing the band structure at the Fermi level. Lithium doped graphene is metallic thus showing an increased reactivity toward free radicals as observed for metallic nanotubes. However. the metallic character of lithium doped graphene is lost when free radicals like OH. SH. H. F. and CH3 are attached; the Fermi level is raised and a gap is opened.

The adsorption of CH 4 inside SWCNTs is expected to be more favorable than on groove sites for open-ended small diameter (0.7–1.1 nm) pure SWCNTs.

These fibers display rich dynamic behavior without losing their architectural integrity. The complexity of the ECM taking care of many essential properties has inspired synthetic chemists to mimic these properties in artificial one-dimensional fibrous structures with the aim to arrive at multi-component biomaterials.

Despite the recognized success of TD‐NMR in quality control and quality assurance. the speed by which samples can be characterized by TD‐NMR techniques is still a concern. primarily when considering online or high‐throughput applications. Therefore. to enhance the speed of TD‐NMR analysis. we developed rapid methods based on steady‐state free precession of nuclear spins. which we denoted continuous wave free precession (CWFP). CWFP substantially increases the sensitivity of TD‐NMR compared with free induction decay or spin‐echo detection. which are traditionally used.

The infrared results show that Z19 has 46% of α helix and 22% of β sheet. The fast N−H to N−D exchange measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that Z19 is not a compact structure. The scattering measurements indicated an extended structure with 12 by 130 Å. With these data. we have modeled the Z19 structure as a hairpin. composed of helical. sheet. turns. and secondary structures. folded back on itself.

With only minor additional requirements. the technique permits a considerable increase in signal-to-noise ratio for a given acquisition time. The experimental conditions needed for implementation and optimization of the acquisition parameters are explored and shown to be easily accessible with unsophisticated equipment.

The requirements of this technique are shown to be no more demanding than those prevailing in free-induction decay or spin-echo measurements. It is shown that the substantial gain in signal to noise ratio for a given acquisition time permitted by CWFP. can be exploited with advantage in practically any application of LRNMR.

The inductive rf drive in our cell produced high plasma densities (1011/cm3 electron densities) and stable plasma potentials. As a result. ion energy distributions typically consisted of a single peak well separated from zero energy. Mean ion energy varied inversely with pressure. decreasing from 13 to 9 eV as the discharge pressure increased from 20 to 60 mTorr. Half-widths of the ion angular distributions in these experiments varied from 6° to 7.5°. corresponding to transverse energies from 0.13 to 0.21 eV.

The well known acylations of aromatics (the Friedel–Crafts reaction) or olefins are commonly carried out under harsh and/or non-sustainable conditions.

Alternatively. triplet states may be generated by energy transfer from another excited state (a sensitiser). In both multiplicities. very fast internal conversion leads to the lowest states (S1 and TI respectively). These states. although still quite short lived (typical lifetime 610-8 s for S1 and< lo4 s for T1) live long enough that a chemical reaction competes with decay to the ground state.Electronically excited states are electronic isomers of the ground state. and not surprisingly show a different chemistry. These. however. can be understood with the same kind of reasoning that is used for ground state chemistry. taking into account that the very large energy accumulated in excited states makes their reactions much faster (in the contrary case. there would be no photochemistry at all. in view of the short lifetime of the key intermediates). As an example. ketones are electrophiles in the ground state due to the partial positive charge on the carbon atom. The reaction with nucleophiles occurs. In the nz* triplet excited state electrons are differently distributed. and the important thing is now the presence of an unpaired electron on the non-bonding orbital localised on the oxygen atom. This makes atom transfer to that atom so fast a process (k-1069-1. many orders of magnitude faster than any reaction of ground state molecules) that it competes efficiently with the decay of such a state.,True,uUsMWAoAAAAJ:eMMeJKvmdy0C,46,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/chapterpdf/2006/9781847550712-00001?isbn=978-0-85404-743-7&sercode=bk,3291642183224910982,/scholar?cites=3291642183224910982,,https://pubs.rsc.org/no/content/chapterpdf/2006/9781847550712-00001?isbn=978-0-85404-743-7&sercode=bk,0,0,0

Some elements are indispensable and essential for life; others are just inert at the usual exposure concentrations. Some elements exhibit high toxicity in very low concentration. and even essential elements can cause deleterious effects in high concentrations. 1. 2 Cobalt is known to be essential at trace levels to humans. animals and plants for metabolic processes. The deficiency of cobalt in ruminants usually results in different types of anemia. Toxicological effects of large amounts of cobalt include vasodilation. flushing and cardiomyopathy in humans and animals. 3 Besides. abnormalities of the metabolism of certain elements are involved in some human diseases. Thus. monitoring the body status of trace elements has received increasing attention by biomedical investigators. Urine analysis is often used for monitoring environmental and occupational exposure to trace elements because urine is the most readily available biological fluid. and most trace elements are mainly extracted via urine. 2Several analytical techniques. such as atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). 4–7 inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) 8 and inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) 9 are available for the determination of trace metals with sufficient sensitivity for most applications.

The optimum reaction conditions were 1.8×10−1 mol l−1 H2SO4. 3.8×10−3 mol l−1 KBrO3. and 1.2×10−4 mol l−1 carminic acid at 30°C. By using the recommended procedure. the calibration graph was linear from 0.2 to 14 ng ml−1 of nitrite; the detection limit was 0.04 ng ml−1; the R.S.D. for six replicate determinations of 6 ng ml−1 was 1.7%.

Thus. there is great interest concerning the implementation of a reliable preconcentration system for lead (II) for analytical determinations. At the moment. one of the most used matrix removal preconcentration methods is the on-line retention of the analyte on an adequate solid support by using microcolumns in a flow system. based on mass transfer between a liquid phase and a solid one. 1 These preconcentration systems can be on-line coupled to several atomic detection techniques. Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) is a simple and very available technique for the determination of heavy metals in water samples. However. the main problem is a low sensitivity for trace metal at the ng/ml level. This limitation can be overcome by using a preconcentration procedure. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) techniques have found increasing applications for the preconcentration of trace metal ions and the elimination of matrix interference prior to an AAS analysis. Activated carbon is one of the sorbent materials that have been used as collectors for trace elements. 2–4 Solid-phase extraction procedures based on the sorption of metal complexes on activated carbon have been widely applied. 2–6 In most of the previous studies. metal complexes were collected on activated carbon as a filter.

In this work. we show that a sputtered 100 nm TiO2 layer on top of a thin Ti metal layer may be used to protect an n+p Si photocathode during photocatalytic H2 evolution. Although TiO2 is a semiconductor. we show that it behaves like a metallic conductor would under photocathodic H2 evolution conditions.

The plant material was harvested from the ecologically pure area on the island of Vis (Croatia). Yield and composition of myrtle oils depended on collected plant parts and on the period of harvest. Myrtenyl acetate (13.5–30.7%). 1. 8-cineole + limonene (12.6–29.8%). linalool (10.8–18.3%) and α-pinene (6.6–16.4%) were five predominant terpenoid compounds in myrtle leaf oils. These compounds were also detected in the flower and fruit oils. but in different proportions. The fruit and flower oils always contained less linalool than leaf oils. During the collecting period the oil yields (w/w) varied as follows: leaf oils (0.19–0.37%). flower oils (0.21–0.26%) and fruit oils (0.03–0.13%).,True,X1N8BdkAAAAJ:dshw04ExmUIC,70,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10412905.2002.9699849,12509362677571276722,/scholar?cites=12509362677571276722,,,0,0,0

Headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with GC and GC/MS enabled identification of the most volatile organic headspace compounds being dominated by terpenes (mainly cis-and trans-linalool oxides). The volatile and less-volatile organic composition of the samples was obtained by ultrasonic assisted extraction (USE) with two solvents (1: 2 (v/v) pentane-diethyl ether mixture and dichloromethane) followed by GC and GC/MS analysis. Shikimic pathway derivatives are of particular interest with respect to the botanical origin of honey and the most abundant was phenylacetic acid (up to 16.4%). Antiradical activity (DPPH assay) of the honeydew samples was 4.5 and 5.1 mmol TEAC/kg. Ultrasonic solvent extracts showed several dozen times higher antiradical capacity in comparison to the honeydew. Antioxidant capacity (FRAP assay) of honeydew samples was 4.8 and 16.1 mmol Fe 2+/kg. while the solvent mixture extracts showed antioxidant activity of 374.5 and 955.9 Fe 2+/kg. respectively. and the dichloromethane extracts 127.3 and 101.5 mmol Fe 2+/kg.

It has been proven that these bioactive compounds. such as polyphenols. polysaccharides. carotenoids. and ω-3 fatty acids possess bioactivity. For the extraction of these compounds. modern methods (Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE). Subcritical Water Extraction (SWE). Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction (UAE). and Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE)) have been used due to their advantages over the conventional methods. The process parameters of each method must be optimized for obtaining the extracts with the targeted bioactive compounds. In distinction from the existing reviews. the present review provides novelty with respect to:(a) presenting systematically the selected process parameters of SFE (temperature. time. pressure. use of co-solvents).

Our understanding of this process. especially how the cytoskeleton influences it. remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking the α-tubulin acetyltransferase Atat1 in sensory neurons display profound deficits in their ability to detect mechanical stimuli. We show that all cutaneous afferent subtypes. including nociceptors have strongly reduced mechanosensitivity upon Atat1 deletion. and that consequently. mice are largely insensitive to mechanical touch and pain. We establish that this broad loss of mechanosensitivity is dependent upon the acetyltransferase activity of Atat1. which when absent leads to a decrease in cellular elasticity. By mimicking α-tubulin acetylation genetically. we show both cellular rigidity and mechanosensitivity can be restored in Atat1 deficient sensory neurons. Hence. our results indicate that by influencing cellular stiffness. α-tubulin acetylation sets the force required for touch.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20813.001,True,snXoIF8AAAAJ:tKAzc9rXhukC,55,https://elifesciences.org/articles/20813,59795212601619945,/scholar?cites=59795212601619945,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/20813.pdf,0,0,0
