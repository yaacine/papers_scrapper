87737,Thrombospondins are astrocyte-secreted proteins that promote CNS synaptogenesis,2005,Karen S Christopherson and Erik M Ullian and Caleb CA Stokes and Christine E Mullowney and Johannes W Hell and Azin Agah and Jack Lawler and Deane F Mosher and Paul Bornstein and Ben A Barres,120,Cell,3,421-433,Cell Press,The establishment of neural circuitry requires vast numbers of synapses to be generated during a specific window of brain development. but it is not known why the developing mammalian brain has a much greater capacity to generate new synapses than the adult brain. Here we report that immature but not mature astrocytes express thrombospondins (TSPs)-1 and -2 and that these TSPs promote CNS synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo. TSPs induce ultrastructurally normal synapses that are presynaptically active but postsynaptically silent and work in concert with other. as yet unidentified. astrocyte-derived signals to produce functional synapses. These studies identify TSPs as CNS synaptogenic proteins. provide evidence that astrocytes are important contributors to synaptogenesis within the developing CNS. and suggest that TSP-1 and -2 act as a permissive switch that times CNS synaptogenesis by enabling …,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC,1437,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867404012450,12072201267058885207,/scholar?cites=12072201267058885207,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867404012450,0,0,0

We have previously identified thrombospondin as an astrocyte-secreted protein that promotes central nervous system (CNS) synaptogenesis. Here. we identify the neuronal thrombospondin receptor involved in CNS synapse formation as α2δ-1. the receptor for the anti-epileptic and analgesic drug gabapentin. We show that the VWF-A domain of α2δ-1 interacts with the epidermal growth factor-like repeats common to all thrombospondins. α2δ-1 overexpression increases synaptogenesis in vitro and in vivo and is required postsynaptically for thrombospondin- and astrocyte-induced synapse formation in vitro.

Ltd,Matrix metalloproteases regulate both physiological and pathological events by processing matrix proteins and growth factors. ADAMTS1 in particular is required for normal ovulation and renal function and has been shown to modulate angiogenesis. Here we report that TSP1 and 2 are substrates of ADAMTS1. Using a combination of mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. we mapped the cleavage sites and characterized the biological relevance of these processing events. ADAMTS1 cleavage mediates the release of polypeptides from the trimeric structure of both TSP1 and 2 generating a pool of antiangiogenic fragments from matrix‐bound thrombospondin.

Integrins are highly versatile cellular receptors that regulate extravasation of eosinophils from the postcapillary segment of the bronchial circulation to the airway wall and airspace.

Inc.,While it is well established that factor XIII functions in crosslinking of the fibrin clot during blood coagulation and in wound healing. the physiological role of tissue transglutaminase is still unclear. Recent studies suggest that the expression of tissue transglutaminase correlates with (terminal) differentiation of cells and that the enzyme may play a role in extracellular matrix remodeling. In cartilage. tissue transglutaminase expression is restricted to hypertrophic chondrocytes and the enzyme is externalized at a distinct step in the chondrocyte maturation program. Upon activation by Ca 2+. the transglutaminase modifies matrix constituents in a way that might predispose the matrix for the subsequent mineralization.

We demonstrate that although urea-treated vitronectin binds PAI-1 with an affinity greater than that of native vitronectin. it does not accelerate the rate of inactivation of alpha-thrombin by PAI-1. We present evidence to suggest that the inability of urea-treated vitronectin to accelerate the reaction between alpha-thrombin and PAI-1 results at least in part from the inability of urea-treated vitronectin to bind to alpha-thrombin. The accelerated reaction between PAI-1 and alpha-thrombin can be accounted for by the formation of a tight complex between native vitronectin and PAI-1 that reacts in a saturable manner (Kd = 75 nM) with alpha-thrombin.

Fibrogenesis is associated with reduced fibroblast apoptosis. The matricellular protein thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) regulates cell adhesion and motility during tissue remodeling and in fibrogenesis. The N‐terminal domain of TSP1 binds to the calreticulin‐LRP1 receptor co‐complex to signal down‐regulation of cell adhesion and increased cell motility through focal adhesion disassembly. TSP1 signaling through calreticulin‐LRP1 activates cell survival signals such as PI3‐kinase. Therefore. we tested the hypothesis that TSP1 supports cell survival under adhesion‐independent conditions to facilitate tissue remodeling.

We investigated the role of another circulating protein. fibronectin. in clumping Staphylococcus aureus. Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein with high molecular weight that is present in both blood and tissue and is involved in opsonization. clotting. healing of wounds. cell-to-cell attachment. and differentiation. Each fibronectin molecule has two S. aureus binding sites. thus allowing lattice formation. We defined conditions under which fibronectin will cause agglutination of S. aureus. Strains of S. aureus that were most easily clumped had the largest number of fibronectin receptors. Trypsinization or gentle sonication removed the fibronectin binding and agglutinating receptors from S. aureus. These treatments did not alter viability. which suggests that binding is a superficial component of the organisms. Invasive fibronectin-binding strains were from a wide variety of phage types. Twenty two S. aureus isolates from patients with invasive disease were more readily agglutinated and had a greater number of fibronectin binding sites than 19 noninvasive strains (p less than 2.5 X 10 (-4)). This suggests that the pathogenicity of S. aureus invasion may be enhanced by binding of bacteria to tissue fibronectin or by agglutination of bacteria by plasma fibronectin.

Cross-linking was also seen if fibronectin was reduced and carboxymethylated prior to addition of Factor XIlIa. or if a chemical crosslinking agent was added after reduction and carboxymethylation.

Similarly. quasielastic light-scattering measurements showed a large decrease in the translational diffusion coefficient (D20. w) of fibronectin after dithiothreitol treatment. Changes in fluorescence polarization or Dzo. w were also seen after dithiothreitol treatment of the isolated disulfide-containing M.= 27.000 and 31.000 tryptic fragments of fibronectin. We studied the properties of a series of fibronectin derivatives which had been treated with various concentrations of dithiothreitol and carboxymethylated. Treatment with 10 m~ dithiothreitol followed by carboxymethylation caused modification ofapproximately80% of the disulfide bonds of fibronectin.

At early time points. these arrays were similar to those formed by intact fibronectin. 70K arrays formed within 5 min following ligand addition at concentrations as low as 5 nM. indicating rapid and high affinity binding.

Treatment of fibroblasts with kinase inhibitors (ML-7. H7. HA1004. calphostin C. and staurosporine) resulted in the rapid decrease in the binding of 125I-labeled plasma Fn and iodinated amino-terminal fragments of Fn. The dose responses of the four inhibitors suggest that the target kinase is protein kinase C (PKC) rather than the cyclic AMP- or cyclic GMP-dependent kinases. Three different fibroblastic cells were similarly affected. The inhibition was rapid and reversible and could not be overcome by increasing concentrations of Fn. Treatment of fibroblasts with phorbol esters and other agents that activate PKC resulted in increased amounts of 125I-labeled Fn binding to the cell surface.

Increased binding was evident within 10 minutes of treatment of cycloheximide-treated cells with LPA and was due to an increase in the number of fibronectin binding sites. LPA also increased the binding of a fragment containing the 70-kDa amino-terminal region of fibronectin that is primarily responsible for the reversible binding of fibronectin to matrix assembly sites on cell surfaces.

In the presence of heparin. recognition of vitronectin by 8E6 was increased 64-or 52-fold by interactionwith the complex of a-thrombin and heparin cofactor II or the Pittsburgh mutant (Met358,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:69ZgNCALVd0C,47,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi00445a017,15960263930081632127,/scholar?cites=15960263930081632127,,,0,0,0

As a biofilm. Candida cells adhere to a surface. such as a vascular catheter. and become encased in an extracellular matrix. During this mode of growth. Candida resists the normal immune response. often causing devastating disease. Based on scanning electron microscopy images. we hypothesized that host cells and proteins become incorporated into clinical biofilms. As a means to gain an understanding of these host-biofilm interactions. we explored biofilm-associated host components by using microscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Here we characterize the host proteins associated with several in vivo rat Candida albicans biofilms. including those from vascular catheter. denture. and urinary catheter models as well as uninfected devices.

87928,Integrin activation states and eosinophil recruitment in asthma,2013,Mats W Johansson and Deane F Mosher,4,Frontiers in pharmacology,,33,Frontiers,Eosinophil arrest and recruitment to the airway in asthma are mediated. at least in part. by integrins. Eosinophils express α4β1. α6β1. αLβ2. αMβ2. αXβ2. αDβ2. and α4β7 integrins. which interact with counter-receptors on other cells or ligands in the extracellular matrix. Whether a given integrin-ligand pair mediates cell adhesion and migration depends on the activation state of the integrin. Integrins exist in an inactive bent. an intermediate-activity extended closed. and a high-activity extended open conformation. Integrin activation states can be monitored by conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Studies in mice indicate that both β1 and β2 integrins mediate eosinophil recruitment to the lung. In vitro studies indicate that α4β1 and αMβ2 are the principal integrins mediating eosinophil adhesion. including to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and the novel αMβ2 ligand periostin. In vivo. blood eosinophils have intermediate-activity β1 integrins. as judged by mAb N29. apparently resulting from eosinophil binding of P-selectin on the surface of activated platelets. and have a proportion of their β2 integrins in the intermediate conformation. as judged by mAb KIM-127. apparently due to exposure to low concentrations of interleukin-5 (IL-5). Airway eosinophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after segmental antigen challenge have high-activity β1 integrins and high-activity αMβ2 that does not require IL-5. Here we review information on how the activation states of eosinophil β1 and β2 integrins correlate with measurements of eosinophil recruitment and pulmonary function in asthma.

We investigated the role of fibronectin assembly in this process. Platelets adherent to fibrillar type I collagen. but not platelets adherent to von Willebrand factor (VWF). supported assembly of plasma fibronectin under static conditions. At a shear rate of 1250 s–1. platelets adherent to collagen assembled coperfused plasma fibronectin and formed larger thrombi in a fibronectin-concentration–dependent manner. with a maximum effect at 250 μg/mL. Enhanced thrombus formation on collagen was blocked by a peptide that binds to the N-terminal region of fibronectin and inhibits fibronectin assembly. Cross-linking of fibronectin to collagen prior to exposure to platelets had no effect on thrombus formation. Collagen-induced platelet thrombus formation at a shear rate of 5000 s–1 required coperfusion with VWF and did not …,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,46,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/108/7/2229/22470,4475644536677459787,/scholar?cites=4475644536677459787,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006497120525032,0,0,0

Of the released proteins. some bind to the surface of activated platelets. some participate in fibrin formation. and some prepare and activate traumatized or inflamed tissue for subsequent repair. In the present chapter. we describe these processes. We pay particular attention to the concentration of certain proteins within alpha granules. which may be up to a millionfold greater than concentrations in plasma and a thousandfold greater than concentrations in serum. We emphasize our recent studies of surface-activated platelets using correlative scanning and high-voltage electron microscopy.

Human fibroblasts at low density have very little extracellular material organized into a filamentous form. A diffuse membrane component of low-density fibroblasts reacts with fibronectin antibodies. As normal fibroblasts grow to confluence. an extensive extracellular filamentous matrix forms. The filaments are 15 to 20 nm in diameter. lack periodicity. and frequently occur in a meshwork. Antibody to fibronectin reacts with these filaments as well as with a diffusely distributed membrane component. Cultures of SV40-transformed human fibroblasts lack the extracellular filamentous matrix reacting with fibronectin antibodies; however. fibronectin is detected on plasma membranes.

Thrombospondin copolymerizes with fibrin during blood coagulation and deposits in extracellular matrix. We found that thrombospondin is a slow (rate constant approximately 6.3 x 10 (3) M-1 sec-1). tight-binding (Kd< 10 (-9) M) inhibitor of plasmin as determined by loss of amidolytic activity. loss of ability to degrade fibrinogen. and decreased lysis zones in fibrin plate assays (Biochemistry 31: 265-269. 1992). Thrombospondin also slowly inhibits urokinase plasminogen activator. The lysis zone when urokinase is put on fibrin plates made from whole plasma is less if thrombospondin is present. The stoichiometry of inhibition is approximately one mole plasmin: one mole thrombospondin trimer. a somewhat surprising result considering the trimeric nature of thrombospondin. These results indicate that thrombospondin is an important regulator of fibrinolysis and degradation of extracellular matrix. particularly when these processes are initiated by urokinase and even when other inhibitors of fibrinolysis are present.,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC,25,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1309073,5390559961288753439,/scholar?cites=5390559961288753439,,,0,0,0

A maleimide spin label was selectively attached to the free thiol group presumably near the carboxyl-terminal domain in which Ca2+-binding sites are situated. The ESR spectra of spin-labeled TSP showed that the bound label undergoes a relatively fast rotational motion with an effective rotational correlation time in the nanosecond time regimes. Removal of bound Ca2+ in TSP by dialyzing spin-labeled TSP from a Ca2+-containing buffer into an EDTA-containing buffer resulted in an increase in the mobility of the bound label by a factor of 2.3.

O-fucosylation. and O-glucosylation. We now describe a fourth: O-β-N-acetylglucosaminylation. Previously. O-β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-β-GlcNAc) was found on a threonine in the loop between the fifth and sixth cysteines of the 20th epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module of Drosophila Notch. A BLAST search based on the Drosophila Notch loop sequence identified a number of human EGF-like modules that contain a similar sequence. including EGF-like module 1 of TSP-1 and its homolog. TSP-2. TSP-1. which has a potentially modifiable serine in the loop. reacted in immuno-blots with the CTD110.6 anti-O-GlcNAc antibody.

The mechanism underlying the role of Gα13 in cell migration. however. remains unclear. Recently we found that Gα13 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β3 subunits in platelets via a conserved ExE motif. Here we show that a similar direct interaction between Gα13 and the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin β1 subunit plays a critical role in β1-dependent cell migration. Point mutation of either glutamic acid in the Gα13-binding 767EKE motif in β1 or treatment with a peptide derived from the Gα13-binding sequence of β1 abolished Gα13–β1 interaction and inhibited β1 integrin–dependent cell spreading and migration.

Its paralog. TGF-β-induced protein (βig-h3. gene name TGFBI). is also expressed in the lung and up-regulated in bronchial myofibroblasts by TGF-β. PN and βig-h3 contain fasciclin 1 modules that harbor putative recognition sequences for γ-glutamyl carboxylase and are annotated in UniProt as undergoing vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation of multiple glutamic acid residues. γ-carboxylation profoundly alters activities of other proteins subject to the modification. e.g.. blood coagulation factors. and would be expected to alter the structure and function of PN and βig-h3.

New York, NY: Marcel Dekker",,455-473,,Fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is present in various body fluids and widely distributed in tissues (reviewed in Refs. 1-9). Fibronectin is evolutionarily conserved and has been identified in mammals. birds. and several invertebrate species. including the sea urchin embryo. and fresh and saltwater sponges (10). There are extensive immunological crossreactivities among fibronectins of different species (11) and between the plasma and tis-sue forms of the molecule (12). although there are antigenic (13) and structural (14. 15) differences between the plasma and cellular forms of the molecule. Because fibronectin is a major and almost ubiquitous component of the body. there has been intense interest in how it may be related to various pathological states. The resulting literature has been reviewed several times recently (16–18).

The 3' end of STAT3 transcripts is subject to two alternative splicing events. One results in either full-length STAT3α or in STAT3β. which lacks part of the C-terminal transactivation domain. The other is at a tandem donor (5') splice site and results in the codon for Ser-701 being included (S) or excluded (ΔS).

This accumulation appeared almost as if there were a blockade in secretion of procollagen under routine culture conditions. Cells treated with ascorbic acid do not have the dense intracellular accumulation of procollagens seen with the apparent blockade of secretion in cells cultured under routine conditions.

Although the role of FN in embryonic blood vessel development is well established. its function and the contribution of individual isoforms in early postnatal vascular development are poorly understood. Here. we employed a tamoxifen-dependent cFN inducible knockout (cFN iKO) mouse model to study the consequences of postnatal cFN deletion in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). the major cell type in the vascular wall. Deletion of cFN influences collagen deposition but does not affect life span. Unexpectedly. pFN translocated to the aortic wall in the cFN iKO and in control mice. possibly rescuing the loss of cFN. Postnatal pFN deletion did not show a histological aortic phenotype. Double knockout (dKO) mice lacking both. cFN in SMCs and pFN. resulted in postnatal lethality. These data demonstrate a safeguard role of pFN in vascular stability and the dispensability of the individual FN isoforms in postnatal vascular development. Complete absence of FNs in the dKOs resulted in a disorganized tunica media of the aortic wall.

Unlabeled FUD competed ~1000-fold better for binding of labeled Bbk32 to FN than unlabeled Bbk32 competed for binding of labeled FUD to FN. Binding kinetics were determined by fluorescence polarization in a stopped-flow apparatus. On-rates for FUD. Bbk32.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced protein (TGFBI) is a widely expressed periostin paralog known to support monocyte adhesion.

Eosinophil adhesion after 1 h and random motility over 20 h in the presence of various concentrations of IL-5. IL-3. or granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were quantified in wells coated with various concentrations of TGFBI or periostin. Results were compared to video microscopy of eosinophils. Cytokine-stimulated eosinophils adhered equivalently well to TGFBI or periostin in a coating concentration-dependent manner. Adhesion was blocked by anti-αMβ2 and stimulated at the lowest concentration by GM-CSF. In the motility assay. periostin was more potent than TGFBI. the coating-concentration effect was bimodal. and IL-3 was the most potent cytokine. Video microscopy revealed that under the optimal coating condition of 5 μg/ml periostin. most eosinophils migrated persistently and were polarized and acorn-shaped with a ruffling forward edge and granules gathered together. in front of the nucleus. On 10 μg/ml periostin or TGFBI. more eosinophils adopted a flattened pancake morphology with dispersed granules and nuclear lobes. and slower migration.

We describe two microplate assays that quantify assembly of human FN by cells in monolayer culture. One assay measures fluorescence due to incorporation of ALEXA488-plasma FN into matrices of fibroblasts and has been used successfully in high-throughput screens. The other measures fluorescence due to binding of fluorochrome-labeled antibody to the EDA domain of cellular FN synthesized and deposited by various cell types. The assays take advantage of the tight association of assembled FN with cell monolayers and adherence of cell monolayers to wells of microtiter plates.

88114,IGD motifs. which are required for migration stimulatory activity of fibronectin type I modules. do not mediate binding in matrix assembly,2012,Lisa M Maurer and Douglas S Annis and Deane F Mosher,7,PloS one,2,e30615,Public Library of Science,Picomolar concentrations of proteins comprising only the N-terminal 70-kDa region (70K) of fibronectin (FN) stimulate cell migration into collagen gels. The Ile-Gly-Asp (IGD) motifs in four of the nine FN type 1 (FNI) modules in 70K are important for such migratory stimulating activity. The 70K region mediates binding of nanomolar concentrations of intact FN to cell-surface sites where FN is assembled. Using baculovirus. we expressed wildtype 70K and 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations in 3FNI and 5FNI; 7FNI and 9FNI; or 3FNI. 5FNI. 7FNI. and 9FNI. Wildtype 70K and 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations were equally active in binding to assembly sites of FN-null fibroblasts. This finding indicates that IGD motifs do not mediate the interaction between 70K and the cell-surface that is important for FN assembly. Further. FN fragment N-3FNIII. which does not stimulate migration. binds to assembly sites on FN-null fibroblast. The Ile-to-Ala mutations had effects on the structure of FNI modules as evidenced by decreases in abilities of 70K with Ile-to-Ala mutations to bind to monoclonal antibody 5C3. which recognizes an epitope in 9FNI. or to bind to FUD. a polypeptide based on the F1 adhesin of Streptococcus pyogenes that interacts with 70K by the β-zipper mechanism. These results suggest that the picomolar interactions of 70K with cells that stimulate cell migration require different conformations of FNI modules than the nanomolar interactions required for assembly.,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:JoZmwDi-zQgC,3,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030615,5828612168164384382,/scholar?cites=5828612168164384382,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030615,0,0,0

Selected TSP1-induced cellular responses are tyrosine kinase-dependent. and TSP1 contains epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats. Specific receptor interactions or functions for the EGF-like repeats have not been identified. We asked whether one or more biological responses to TSP1 might be explained through EGF receptor (EGFR) activation. In A431 cells. TSP1 increased autophosphorylation of Y1068 of EGFR in a dose-and time-dependent manner. The ability of TSP1 to activate EGFR was replicated by the tandem EGF-like repeats as a recombinant protein. The three EGF-like repeats alone produced a high level of Y1068 phosphorylation. EGF-like repeats from TSP2 and TSP4 also activated EGFR. Y1068 phosphorylation was less when individual EGF-like repeats were tested or flanking sequences were added to the three EGF-like repeats. TSP1 and its EGF-like repeats also increased phosphorylation of EGFR Y845. Y992. Y1045. Y1086. and Y1173. activated phospholipase Cγ. and increased cell migration. No evidence was found for binding of the EGF-like repeats to EGFR. Instead. EGFR activation in response to TSP1 or its EGF-like repeats required matrix metalloprotease (MMP) activity. including activity of MMP9.

TSP1 is now recognized as the first identified member of a family of related proteins including TSP2. TSP3. TSP4. and TSP5/COMP5. 6). Each of the unique genes that encode TSP1 through 5 lie on different chromosomes which have been identifed in humans as chromosomes 15. 6. 1. 5. and 9. respectively. Members of the thrombospondin family are large oligomeric proteins consisting of multiple modules. Analysis of the number and type of modules indicates there are two sub-families. with TSP1 and TSP2 forming the first branch. while TSP3. TSP4. and TSPS form the second branch. A phylogenetic tree constructed from multiple sequence alignments indicates that the branching of these two sub-families occurred 900 million years ago5). Moving from amino to carboxy terminus. TSP1 and TSP2 are composed of the following modules heparin binding (N); oligomerization(o); procollagen (C); three type 1 repeats (P123); three type 2 repeats (E123); seven type III repeats (Ca); and the C-terminal globular domain (figure 1B). TSP1 and TSP2 form disulfide bonded homo-trimers via coiled-coil association of the oligomerization domains (Fig. 1A). Comparison of TSP1 and TSP2 sequences reveals that the amino acid identity between them increases from amino to carboxy terminus (Fig. 1C). The domain organization of TSP3. 4. and 5 are different from TSP1 and 2 in several ways. From the amino terminus.

New York, NY: Springer",,219-240,,Tibronectin (FN) is a paradigm adhesive protein. nonreactive with T'adhesion receptors in its soluble state and highly adhesive when insoluble. Polymerization of FN into the extracellular matrix (ECM) must be tightly regulated in order to insure that the adhesive infor-mation in ECM is appropriate. Prior to gastrulation. for instance. a matrix of FN is deposited rapidly.'Altered deposition of matrix molecules. including FN. has been associated with such pathological events as cancer. atherosclerosis. and fibrosis. 2-6 The aim of this chapter is to describe both the mechanisms and consequences of FN deposition.The usual model to study cellular interactions with FN is the fibroblast. These cells. cultured in serum-containing medium. deposit FN very shortly after adherence to the substratum. Such cells can be considered as the equivalent of specialized fibroblast-like cells. called myofibroblasts. present in tissues undergoing contraction. Tissue contraction is a part of normal wound healing. Cultured fibroblasts generate tension. and it is the tension-generating cells that assemble FN matrix. 7.8 The relationships among tension. cell shape.,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:cFHS6HbyZ2cC,2,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3268802613455964516&hl=en&oi=scholarr,3268802613455964516,/scholar?cites=3268802613455964516,,,0,0,0

Blasts in all four cases were also terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive. Two cases demonstrated the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. t(9;22). The only cells in normal bone marrow which reacted with antibody to TSP were megakaryocytes. Blasts in nine cases of acute myelogenous leukemia. six cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia. four cases of undifferentiated leukemia. and three cases of myelodysplastic syndrome were negative for TSP. Thus. TSP is useful in the identification of normal megakaryocytes and a subset of acute leukemia cells.

88136,[8] Ex vivo measurement of platelet adhesion to polymeric surfaces,1989,Kinam Park and Deane F Mosher and Stuart L Cooper,169,,,91-104,Academic Press,This chapter describes the ex vivo measurement of platelet adhesion to polymeric surfaces. Clotting times upon exposure of blood to test materials have been used as a complementary measure of platelet adhesion. It is necessary to distinguish platelet adhesion from blood clotting. The measurement of platelet adhesion is a direct test of surface thrombogenicity. The number of platelets adhered on surfaces varies widely. depending on experimental conditions. such as the species of platelets used. the type of anticoagulant employed. the presence of plasma proteins. and whether in vitro or in vivo assays are used. The transformation of adherent platelets to the spread form and subsequent mural thrombus formation invariably occurs in vivo or ex vivo upon exposure of artificial materials to flowing blood.

Assembly of fibrillins into microfibrils is often compromised in pathological situations such as the Marfan syndrome and other fibrillinopathies. We have used a cellular model system to analyze assembly of fibrillin‐1 in dependence of fibronectin. Fibrillin‐1 assembly was strictly dependent on the presence of fibronectin fibers. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy experiments showed that fibrillin‐1 and fibronectin colocalized to the same fiber system at early stages of the assembly of both proteins. Using a fibronectin assembly inhibiting peptide (FUD). we observed that homeostasis of fibrillin‐1 fibers is dependent on the constant availability of fibronectin fibers. Solid phase binding assays demonstrated that fibronectin interacted with the C‐terminal region of all fibrillins. We also demonstrated that …,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:1sJd4Hv_s6UC,0,https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.24.1_supplement.480.10,,,,,0,0,0

We investigated regulatory effects of TSP1 on phorbol ester (PMA)‐mediated superoxide generation from human U937 monocytic cells differentiated with recombinant human interferon‐gamma. Soluble TSP1 caused a significant increase in PMA‐mediated superoxide generation. Trimeric recombinant constructs containing the N‐modules. but not other recombinant regions of TSP1. replicated the activity of TSP1. A similar effect of TSP1 on superoxide generation has been described in human neutrophils. The superoxide‐generated via NADPH oxidase is an important component of the innate immune response.

L.. Gullberg. D.. and Johansson. S.(2001) Exp. Cell Res. 265. 135–144 and Wennerberg. K.. Lohikangas. L.. Gullberg. D.. Pfaff. M.. Johansson. S.. and Fassler. R.(1996) J. Cell Biol. 132. 227–238). We have studied the role of collagen receptors. integrins 11 1 and 2 1. and fibronectin in collagen polymerization using fibronectin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cell lines. In contrast to the earlier belief that collagen polymerization occurs via self-assembly of collagen molecules we show that a preformed fibronectin matrix is essential for collagen network formation and that collagen-binding integrins strongly enhance this process. Thus. collagen deposition is regulated by the cells. both indirectly through integrin 5 1-dependent polymerization of fibronectin and directly through collagenbinding integrins.Collagens form a large family of proteins with more than 20 different members described to date (3). The organization of different collagens into various types of fibrils and networks in extracellular matrices (ECM) 1 is of crucial importance for the physical properties of tissues. Type I and III collagens. the predominant proteins in the body. are prototypes for the fibrillar collagen subfamily.

88238,Biophysical Studies of the Type 1 Repeats of Human Thrombospondin-1 to Characterize the Structural Basis of its Angiostatic Effect,1999,Kristin G Huwiler and Deane F Mosher,,,,,WISCONSIN UNIV-MADISON,Thrombospondin-1 TSP1 is a disulfide bonded trimer of 450kD each monomer contains three type 1 repeats T1Rs. TSP1 and fragments that include the T 1Rs have several documented functions including a role as an inhibitor of endothelial cell growth and migration. as well as an inducer of apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to express. purify. and biophysically characterize the T1Rs. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated that express the three T1Rs in tandem P123 and the third T1R P3 as secreted histidine-tagged fusion proteins. Protein purity. molecular mass determination. and di sulfide-bond content was determined using mass spectroscopy. Micro-heterogenity arising from differential glycosylation was determined by western blotting. HPLC. and mass spectroscopy. Circular dichroism was used to access secondary and tertiary structure as well as thermal stability. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the conserved tryptophans were quenched and in a partial polar environment in the native state. The effect of TSP1 and the T1Rs on endothelial cell EC morphology and death was determined. The results indicate the T1R encodes an independently folding protein module with spectral properties dominated by the conserved tryptophans. The protein is heterogeneously glycosylated with C-linked and 0-linked sugars. The T1Rs are not responsible for the apoptotic effect on Ecs.Descriptors:,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:RtRctb2lSbAC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADB255411,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADB255411.pdf,0,0,0

The present study was performed in order to obtain information about the location of the BH-endorphin binding site on the vitronectin molecule. In a first approach. microtiter plates were coated with vitronectin and a polyclonal antiserum against vitronectin or monoclonal antibodies directed against various vitronectin epitopes were tested for their capability to inhibit BH-endorphin binding to vitronectin. Although BH-endorphin binding proved to be inhibited by the polyclonal antiserum. none of the monoclonal antibodies was able to influence the BH-endorphin interaction with vitronectin. In a further type of investigation Bit-endorphin (27-31). which represents the BH-endorphin fragment primarily responsible for the BH-endorphin binding to vitronectin. was radioactively labeled and allowed to bind to vitronectin; subsequently it was covalently coupled to the vitronectin molecule and the conjugate was subjected to endoproteinase Argo digestion. SDS-PAGE of the digest revealed several radioactively labeled vitronectin cleavage products which were blotted over to a PVDF membrane; they were localized on the membrane by autoradiography and were analysed for their position within the vitronectin molecule by amino acid sequencing. Evidence was obtained for one or several sites of BH-endorphin interaction with vitronectin. which are apparently related to the middle region of the vitronectin amino acid sequence.,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:AZju0d2GQJ0C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2921674754373516801&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

As cells adhere to a substratum. contacts are established mainly via members of the integrin superfamily (3. 4). During this process. integrins become localized on the ventral surface of the cells in focal contacts. providing a transmembrane link between the ECM and the cytoskeletal cell machinery (5. 6). The vascular endothelium has emerged as a highly dynamic environment maintaining its integrity by factors that mediate the attachment and growth of endothelial cells (ECs). The integrity of the vascular endothelium is an essential requirement governing the vascular tone and permeability. as well as preventing the vessel wall from platelet deposition and thrombus formation (7. 8). Most EC receptors for ECM proteins belong to the integrin superfamily recognizing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif found in many ECM proteins and the Leu-Asp-Val (LDV) sequence in fibronectin (1. 2). Adhesive interactions play a leading role in the progression of vascular thrombosis and subsequent wound healing. Following vascular injury. the fibrin dependent aggregation of platelets adherent to the exposed subendothelium (8. 9) contributes to the formation of thrombus that initially seals the vessel to prevent excessive blood loss. Subsequently. a local repair mechanism is initiated. involving EC attachment. migration and proliferation to renew the damaged vessel.

88276,INTRODUCTION TO HEMOSTASIS,1984,Deane F Mosher,,Pathophysiology of Blood,1,197,Churchill Livingstone,Hemostasis refers to the mechanisms that cause blood to turn from a fluid to a gel and thus prevent blood from escaping from injured blood vessels. Normal hemostasis requires cellular and humoral components (Fig. 9.1). Tissue and vascular injury expose blood to substances that cause adhesion and aggregation of platelets and activation of the network of plasma coagulation proteins. Platelet plug formation occurs almost instantly and is followed within five minutes by the production of a fibrin gel. The definitive hemostatic plug consists of irreversibly aggregated platelets stabilized by a fibrin network. Several mechanisms localize activation of platelet and coagulation factors to the precise area of injury. The hemostatic plug serves as a nidus for the migration and growth of cells into the site of injury. When healing is established. the plug is lysed by cell-based fibrinolytic activators. Abnormal bleeding can result from thrombocytopenia (lack of platelets). defective platelet adhesion. defective platelet aggregation. defective fibrin formation. or overactive fibrinolysis. Thrombosis can result from inappropriate activation of hemostasis. failure to localize hemostasis. or failure of fibrinolysis. Inasmuch as a working knowledge of platelets. coagulation. and fibrinolysis is required for almost every area of medicine. it is worth learning about these mechanisms in some detail.,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3465198361045842013&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Researchers on von Willebrand factor and fibronectin have learned much from one another. Preparations of fibronectin tend to be contaminated with von Willebrand factor and vice versa. and early on it was a challenge to purify the two proteins so as to be free of one another. Both proteins are disulfide-bonded dimers in their protomeric state but have a tendency to form disulfide-bonded multimers. Both are potent adhesive proteins. Both are recognized by cell surface integrin receptors. This paper is written with deep gratitude for the wisdom and enlightenment that Ted Zimmerman gave us.

PN receives attention because of its up-regulation in cancer and degenerative and allergic diseases. βig-h3 is highly enriched in cornea and best known for harboring mutations in humans associated with corneal dystrophies. Both proteins are expressed widely. and many functions. some over-lapping. have been attributed to PN and βig-h3 based on biochemical. cell culture. and whole animal experiments. We attempt to organize this knowledge so as to facilitate research on these interesting and incompletely understood proteins. We focus particularly on whether PN and βig-h3 are modified by vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylation. a question of considerable importance given the profound effects of γ-carboxylation on structure and function of other proteins. We consider the roles of PN and βig-h3 in formation of extracellular matrix and as ligands for integrin receptors. We attempt to reconcile the contradictory results that have arisen concerning the role of PN. which has emerged as a marker of TH2 immunity. in murine models of allergic asthma. Finally. when possible we compare and contrast the structures and functions of the two proteins.,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:isU91gLudPYC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16939643446881601863&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

88314,Aleydis Rivera-Torres Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico Deane Mosher and Bianca Tomasini-Johansson Department of Hematology School of Medicine,,Deane Mosher,,,,,,The assembly of fibronectin (FN) matrix is important in a variety of physiological and pathological processes where cellular adhesion. migration and proliferation are necessary. It is the assembled or insoluble form of FN that is active as an adhesive molecule. The N-terminal 70-kDa fragment of FN. a region in the middle of FN containing the sequence RGD and other regions involved in FN-FN interactions. is important for FN assembly. The RGD region binds to integrins. heterodimeric receptors that mediate adhesion. whereas the cell surface sites that the N-terminal binds to is tentatively termed as Large Apparent Molecular Mass Molecules (LAMMs). We postulate that localization of integrins at focal adhesion sites is required for activation of LAMMs which then initiate FN assembly in the N-terminal 70-kDa region. It has been previously thought that co-localization of integrins and 70-kDa fragment at focal contacts was due to endogenous FN binding integrins and the70kDa fragment. We attempted to investigate the role of integrins and the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecule LN in the assembly of 70-kDa fragment linear arrays in cells that do not express FN. We found that localization of ß1 integrins at focal contacts mostly but not always correlated well with sites of 70-kDa fragment linear array deposition. ß1 was also present at contact sites without 70-kDa localization. and viceversa. This suggests the involvement of ß1 in 70-kDa linear array formation even in the absence of endogenous FN but also indicates that other cell surface molecules. most likely LAMMs. are required for 70-kDa fragment binding and assembly. Also we found that soluble LN …,True,ii3Zn4oAAAAJ:86PQX7AUzd4C,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.500.6739&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.500.6739&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The outcome of this translocation is the fusion gene bcrabl found on chromosome 22. The significance of this research is to determine if a genetic approach utilizing bcr-abl transgenic Drosophila can be used to identify functionally significant downstream targets of Bcr-Abl. Identification of human homologues of these genes may aid in the development of treatments for CML. To study Bcr-Abl signaling in a genetic model system. bcr-abl transgenic flies were generated and the UAS-GAL4 system was used to specifically target Bcr-Abl protein expression to the developing eye. bcr-abl transgenic flies expressing Bcr-Abl protein in the developing eye develop into viable adults with a rough eye phenotype.
