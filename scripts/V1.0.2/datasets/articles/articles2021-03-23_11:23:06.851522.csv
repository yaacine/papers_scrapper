Nanocrystals were made using a secondary phosphine selenide as the Se source. which. compared to tertiary phosphine selenide precursors. was found to provide higher product yields and smaller nanocrystals that elicit quantum confinement with a size-dependent optical gap.

CIGS PV layers are typically made using a high temperature (>450 °C) process in which Cu. In and Ga are sequentially or co-evaporated and selenized. We have sought to use CIGS nanocrystals synthesized with the desired stoichiometry to deposit PV device layers without high temperature processing. This approach. using spray deposition of the CIGS light absorber layers. without high temperature selenization. has enabled up to 3.1% power conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 solar illumination. Although the device efficiency is too low for commercialization. these devices provide a proof-of-concept that solution-deposited CIGS nanocrystal films can function in PV devices. enabling unconventional device …,True,O7li4a4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,137,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022459611005950,1175883441009166910,/scholar?cites=1175883441009166910,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank_T_Edelmann/post/Can_I_replace_1-hexanethiol_with_another_solvent_in_the_preparation_of_nano-ink_CZTS_as_a_hole_transport_material_in_perovskite_solar_cells/attachment/5f4fbab06a5a0300017c5360/AS%3A931342044901376%401599060655005/download/Colloidal_CIGS_and_CZTS_nanocrystals_A_p.pdf,0,0,0

The electrical conductivity of the nanocrystal films was about 4 to 5 S/cm. more typical of metal nanocrystal films than semiconductor nanocrystal films. and the lack of PV response appears to derive from the highly conductive surface-related defects in pyrite that have been proposed.,True,O7li4a4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,131,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jz301023c,5302967945513498930,/scholar?cites=5302967945513498930,,,0,0,0

The extraction of more than one electron/hole pair as a result of the absorption of a single photon can occur if multiple excitons are generated and extracted. Multiexciton generation (MEG) in the nanocrystal films was substantiated by transient absorption spectroscopy. We propose that photonic curing leads to sufficient electronic coupling between nanocrystals to enable multiexciton extraction under typical solar illumination conditions.

Here. we report that ink deposition followed by annealing under inert gas and then selenization can provide better control over CIGS nanocrystal sintering and yield generally improved device efficiency. Annealing under argon at 525 °C removes organic ligands and diffuses sodium from the underlying soda lime glass into the Mo back contact to improve the rate and quality of nanocrystal sintering during selenization at 500 °C.

1187235,Sintering of Cu (In. Ga) Se2 nanocrystal films for photovoltaics,2015,Taylor Bryan Harvey,,,,,,Low cost solar cells are needed to increase availability and reliability of electricity throughout the world. Spray deposition of Cu(In.Ga)Se₂ (CIGS) nanocrystal inks is a promising route to low cost photovoltaics(PVs). CIGS nanocrystal inks have been used to fabricate solar cells with 3.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) without any heat treatment. but are limited by poor charge transport. Sintering the nanocrystals into a polycrystalline film improves charge transport and device performance. Two sintering methods are investigated here: selenization and photonic curing. The nanocrystal films can be sintered by annealing the films in a Se environment. also known as selenization. The selenized device morphology and efficiency is influenced by the starting nanocrystal composition. A Se/Carbon layer deriving from the organic ligand decreases device efficiency. but is eliminated by annealing the nanocrystal films in Ar before the selenization treatment. In addition to eliminating the Se/Carbon layer. the pre-selenization anneal drives Na from the soda-lime glass substrate into the film and improves grain growth. Devices with efficiencies above 7.0% are fabricated using a multi-step deposition and sintering process. To simplify device fabrication. a single-step. scalable deposition is demonstrated using fully automated. ultrasonic spray coating. The ultrasonic spray deposition is highly sensitive to the nanocrystal ink organic content. and optimization of the nanocrystal synthesis wash procedure leads to highly uniform. reflective nanocrystal films. Devices fabricated from these films achieve 6.6% efficiency after selenization.

Here we report a highly reproducible linear relationship between the concentration of ligand (in this case oleic acid.

For laser action. feedback is provided by reflections at the cleaved edges of the crystal resulting in a Fabry-Perot resonator. Increasing the injected current density above a certain threshold value results in the decreasing of the spectral width of the emission from 120 millielectron volts to less than 1 millielectron volt because of gain narrowing and eventually laser action. High electron and hole mobilities as well as balanced charge carrier injection lead to improved exciton generation in these gate-controlled devices.

Bi halides and halide perovskites have been predicted to be among the most promising Pb-free alternatives; however. their performance in devices has fallen short of expectations. One of the major challenges in fabricating efficient devices based on these Bi-based alternatives has been poor control over the morphology of thin films.

The synthesis mechanism follows a temperature-dependent diffusion growth model leading to strategies that can achieve narrow size distributions for a range of sizes. We show that PbS QDs can be produced with a diameter as small as 2.2 nm. corresponding to a 1.7 eV band gap. while the resulting size distribution (6–7%) is comparable to that of hot-injection syntheses. The in situ chloride surface passivation is demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and an improved photostability of both PbS and PbSe QDs when stored under air.

Crucial to the sensitization process is highly efficient transfer of redox equivalents from sensitizer to catalyst; in systems with molecular sensitizers. this transfer is often slow because it is gated by diffusion-limited collisions between sensitizer and catalyst.

We observed that various carbon-based particles in the molten salt glow red even at temperatures as low as 800 C. We used that property to qualitatively analyze the dispersion of particles in the salt. It is clear that hollow carbon spheres disperse in the molten salt to a higher degree than any other particles. Nanodiamonds and onion-like carbon nanoparticle are heavier than the salt and without nay favorable interaction they just sediment. Hollow carbon spheres on the other hand allow the salt into the cavity. leading to density-matching and their dispersion.

These short. robust. and easy to model ligands bind to the NC surface and provide electrostatic stabilization of NC dispersions in N-methylformamide. The replacement of organic ligands on NCs with compact halide and pseudohalide ligands greatly facilitates electronic communication between NCs.

Various inorganic anions including MCCs. metal-free chalcogenides. oxoanions/oxometallates. and halides/pseudohalides/halometallates have been employed to replace the original long-chain organic ligands on NCs. This ligand exchange can also be achieved through a two-step route using ligands stripping agents like HBF4.

Using N.N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a mild oxidizing agent. the NWs’ surface traps density was reduced by over 2 orders of magnitude from 1 × 1013 cm–2 in pristine NWs to 3.7 × 1010 cm–2 in DMF-treated NWs. leading to a dramatic hysteresis reduction in NW field-effect transistors (FETs) from up to 32 V to a near-zero hysteresis. The change of the polyphenylsilane NW shell stoichiometric composition was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showing a 35% increase in fully oxidized Si4+ species for DMF-treated NWs compared to dry NW powder. Additionally. a shell oxidation effect induced by DMF resulted is a more stable NW FET performance with steady transistor currents and only 1.5 V hysteresis after 1000 h of air exposure.,True,7FQdy8wAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,7,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.5b07140,4379823202589905212,/scholar?cites=4379823202589905212,,http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/810280/1/Hysteresis%20paper.pdf,0,0,0

1187429,Silicon nanowires: synthesis and use as lithium-ion battery anodes,2014,Timothy Daniel Bogart,,,,,,As the power demands of mobile technologies continue to increase. lithium-ion batteries are needed with greater power and energy density. Silicon anodes offer an alternative to commercial graphite with much greater gravimetric and volumetric Li storage. Si nanowires are particularly compelling anode materials because they provide short Li diffusion paths due to their narrow diameter combined with long continuous paths for electron transport down their length. To achieve reasonable battery performance in Si nanowire anodes. conductive carbon particles must be added to provide sufficient electrical conductivity through the anode layer. This lowers the capacity of the anode. but more importantly the carbon particles can segregate in the electrode layer during processing or as a result of mechanical stresses during cycling. leading to unreliable performance. Better performance can be achieved by altering the structure of the Si nanowire to improve electrical conductivity. Si nanowires with a conductive carbon coating were synthesized in a supercritical organic solvent using an organometallic tin precursor to seed growth. The coating eliminated the need for additional conductive additives and improved Si nanowire anode performance. In situ TEM experiments showed that the coated nanowires exhibit higher lithiation rates than bare Si nanowires. but the coating restricts volume expansion limiting the amount of Li storage. Nanowires with a crystalline Si core and amorphous Si shell were also synthesized. The thickness of the core and shell were controlled by altering the Si:Sn precursor ratio. Sn was found to incorporate strongly within the …,True,7FQdy8wAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,1,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/44103,8132387383830859631,/scholar?cites=8132387383830859631,,https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/44103/BOGART-DISSERTATION-2014.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

For cerium oxide. the bulk (cubic) CeO 2 phase remains stable down to 4.8 nm and. as expected. does not undergo a transition to any of the other available structures with lower symmetry.© 1996 The American Physical Society.,True,HhHdkpkAAAAJ:2P1L_qKh6hAC,185,https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.53.2167,3706895918343243661,/scholar?cites=3706895918343243661,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pushan_Ayyub/publication/233414756_Size-Induced_Structural_Transitions_in_the_Cu-O_and_Ce-O_Systems/links/0912f50a64026847e7000000/Size-Induced-Structural-Transitions-in-the-Cu-O-and-Ce-O-Systems.pdf,0,0,0

1187507,Morphological effects of organic and inorganic semiconducting materials by scanning probe microscopy,2012,Micah Sivan Glaz,,,,,,Solution deposition of thin film photovoltaic materials leads to large variations in the morphological and chemical compositions of the film. In order to improve device functionality. it is important to understand how morphology and chemical composition affects charge generation. separation. and collection. This PhD work will first study bulk methods in order to characterize materials in solution and films. The results are then correlated with microscopy studies examining morphology. Other methods used in this PhD work will directly couple spectra and microscopy. Microscopic regions of such films and devices can be illuminated using scanning confocal microscopy or near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM). which allows for one to directly probe regions of the film at or below the optical diffraction limit. By scanning the sample over a fixed laser spot we can simultaneously create image maps of the topographical. electrical and optical properties. This technique. known as laser beam induced current (LBIC) allows one to directly probe a local area of a device with 100-300nm resolution. Along with bulk device efficiency studies. near field and confocal data of inorganic and organic materials are investigated. These include devices fabricated with a blend of P3HT (poly[3-hexylthiophene]) and perylene diimide derivatives. and Cu(InxGa1-x)Se2 [CIGS] nanoparticle devices.

Single molecule fluorescence spectra and excitation/emission polarization measurements were compared with a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) model simulation. An increase in the mean single chain polarization anisotropy from excitation to emission was observed for both rr- and rra-P3HT. The peak emission wavelengths of rr-P3HT were at substantially lower energies than those of rra-P3HT. A simulation based on FRET in single polymer chain conformations successfully reproduced the experimental observations.

For example. trap levels are often assumed to be discrete in energy. Using the well-known keto defect in polyfluorene as a model. we demonstrate how single-molecule spectroscopy can directly track the formation of charge and exciton traps in conjugated polymers in real time. providing crucial information on the energetic distribution of trap sites relative to the polymer optical gap.

The results suggest that there is a kinetic barrier for hole injection that prevents polymer particles from being charged in the dark. This barrier can be overcome with the assistance of optical excitation of the MEH-PPV nanoparticles. achieving a thermodynamic population of injected holes at positive bias. The amount of injected holes at equilibrium is observed to depend upon the bias in a manner highly consistent with device simulations based on a continuum model.

1187571,Surface science investigations of oxidative chemistry on gold,2009,Jinlong Gong and C Buddie Mullins,42,,8,1063-1073,American Chemical Society,  Because of gold’s resistance to oxidation and corrosion. historically chemists have considered this metal inert. However. decades ago. researchers discovered that highly dispersed gold particles on metal oxides are highly chemically active. particularly in low-temperature CO oxidations. These seminal findings spurred considerable interest in investigations and applications of gold-based materials. Since the discovery of gold’s chemical activity at the nanoscale. researchers found that bulk gold also has interesting catalytic properties. Thus. it is important to understand and contrast the intrinsic chemical properties of bulk gold with those of nanoparticle Au.Despite numerous studies. the structure and active site of supported Au nanoclusters and the active oxygen species remain elusive. and model studies under well-controlled conditions could help identify these species.

This spectrum is clearly distinct from the O+CO case. where atomically chemisorbed oxygen is obtained either by thermal dissociation of O2 on the surface or by exposing the 90 K surface to a beam containing O atoms.

The trapping process involves very rapid equilibration of the normal component of incidence velocity but extremely slow accommodation of the parallel component. At high surface temperatures for which the residence time of Ar is sufficiently short (e.g.. roughly 40 ps at 273 K). trapped atoms desorb before their incident parallel velocity is thermalized. Thus trapping in the usual sense of complete equilibration with the surface does not occur; instead these quasitrapped atoms are characterized by full accommodation of only the normal velocity component.

1187633,Best practice methods for determining an electrode material's performance for ultracapacitors,2010,Meryl D Stoller and Rodney S Ruoff,3,,9,1294-1301,Royal Society of Chemistry,Ultracapacitors are rapidly being adopted for a wide range of electrical energy storage applications. While ultracapacitors are able to deliver high rates of charge and discharge. they are limited in the amount of energy stored. The capacity of ultracapacitors is largely determined by the electrode material and as a result research to improve the performance of electrode materials has dramatically increased. While test methods for packaged ultracapacitors are well developed. it is often impractical for the materials scientist to assemble full sized. packaged cells to test electrode materials. Methodology to reliably measure a material's performance for use as an ultracapacitor electrode is not well standardized with various techniques yielding widely varying results.

Here. we show experimentally that κ of monolayer graphene exfoliated on a silicon dioxide support is still as high as about 600 watts per meter per kelvin near room temperature. exceeding those of metals such as copper.

Recently. chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of hydrocarbons has shown some promise in growing large-area graphene or few-layer graphene films on metal substrates such as Ni and Cu. It has been proposed that CVD growth of graphene on Ni occurs by a C segregation or precipitation process whereas graphene on Cu grows by a surface adsorption process.

1187638,Mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nanotubes,1995,Rodney S Ruoff and Donald C Lorents,33,carbon,7,925-930,Pergamon,This chapter discusses some aspects of the mechanical and thermal properties of carbon nano-tubes. The tensile and bending stiffness constants of ideal multi-walled and single-walled carbon nano-tubes are derived in terms of the known elastic properties of graphite. Tensile strengths are estimated by scaling the 20 GPa tensile strength of Bacon's graphite whiskers. The natural resonance (fundamental vibrational frequency) of a cantilevered single-wall nanotube of length 1 micron is shown to be about 12 MHz. It is suggested that the thermal expansion of carbon nanotubes will be essentially isotropic. which can be contrasted with the strongly anisotropic expansion in “conventional” (large diameter) carbon fibers and in graphite.

Lead halide perovskite single crystals featuring long diffusion length. high carrier mobility. large light absorption coefficient and low defect density. have been attracting increasing attention. Fundamental study of the intrinsic nature keeps revealing the superior optoelectrical properties of perovskite single crystals over their polycrystalline thin film counterparts. but to date. the device performance lags behind. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single crystal-based solar cells is 21.9%. falling behind that of polycrystalline thin film solar cells (25.2%).

The growth rate was found to be determined by the local V/III ratio. which is dependent on the input precursor flow rates. growth temperature. and substrate decomposition.

We present new results for the size-dependent growth kinetics of Ge NWs and correlate the results with a direct experimental measurement of the Gibbs−Thomson effect. a measured increase in the Ge solute concentration in liquid Au−Ge droplets with decreasing diameter. This nanoscale-dependent effect emerges in vapor−liquid−solid Ge NW growth and leads to a decrease in the NW growth rate for smaller diameter NWs under a wide range of growth conditions with a cutoff in growth at sufficiently small sizes. These effects are described quantitatively by an analytical model based on the Gibbs−Thomson effect.

Due to slow surface state charging and discharging. the NWFET characteristics are time dependent with time constants as long as ∼45s. This is also manifested in a time-dependent extrinsic transconductance that severely affects carrier mobility and carrier density determination from conventional three-terminal current-voltage characteristics. Slow gate voltage sweep rates result in charge balance between carrier capture and emission from interface states and lead to reduced hysteresis in the transfer curves. The gate transconductance is thus increased and intrinsic NW transport parameters can be isolated.

This anisotropic swelling results in lithiated Si nanowires with a remarkable dumbbell-shaped cross section. which develops due to plastic flow and an ensuing necking instability that is induced by the tensile hoop stress buildup in the lithiated shell.

Such ledge flow processes produce the amorphous Li x Si alloy through layer-by-layer peeling of the {111} atomic facets. resulting in the orientation …,True,V5UCf_wAAAAJ:Ak0FvsSvgGUC,484,https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2012.170,13033281073198634656,/scholar?cites=13033281073198634656,,http://li.mit.edu/A/Archive/Papers/12/Liu12WangNatureNano.pdf,0,0,0

The carbon coating and phosphorus doping each resulted in a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity of the nanowires that. in turn. resulted in a 1 order of magnitude increase in charging rate. In addition. electrochemical solid-state amorphization (ESA) and inverse ESA were directly observed and characterized during a two-step phase transformation process during lithiation: crystalline silicon (Si) transforming to amorphous lithium–silicon (LixSi) which transforms to crystalline Li15Si4 (capacity 3579 mAh·g–1). The ultrafast charging rate is attributed to the nanoscale diffusion length and the improved electron and ion transport. These results provide important insight in how to use Si as a high energy …,True,V5UCf_wAAAAJ:OcBU2YAGkTUC,396,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl200412p,14348590174186808197,/scholar?cites=14348590174186808197,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/He_Zheng3/publication/51118654_Ultrafast_Electrochemical_Lithiation_of_Individual_Si_Nanowire_Anodes/links/5a37308b0f7e9b10d8484f2a/Ultrafast-Electrochemical-Lithiation-of-Individual-Si-Nanowire-Anodes.pdf,0,0,0
1187696,Adaptable silicon–carbon nanocables sandwiched between reduced graphene oxide sheets as lithium ion battery anodes,2013,Bin Wang and Xianglong Li and Xianfeng Zhang and Bin Luo and Meihua Jin and Minghui Liang and Shadi A Dayeh and ST Picraux and Linjie Zhi,7,ACS nano,2,1437-1445,American Chemical Society,Silicon has been touted as one of the most promising anode materials for next generation lithium ion batteries. Yet. how to build energetic silicon-based electrode architectures by addressing the structural and interfacial stability issues facing silicon anodes still remains a big challenge. Here. we develop a novel kind of self-supporting binder-free silicon-based anodes via the encapsulation of silicon nanowires (SiNWs) with dual adaptable apparels (overlapped graphene (G) sheaths and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) overcoats). In the resulted architecture (namely. SiNW@G@RGO). the overlapped graphene sheets. as adaptable but sealed sheaths. prevent the direct exposure of encapsulated silicon to the electrolyte and enable the structural and interfacial stabilization of silicon nanowires. Meanwhile. the flexible and conductive RGO overcoats accommodate the volume change of embedded SiNW@G …,True,V5UCf_wAAAAJ:ubry08Y2EpUC,392,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn3052023,15155592367525002899,/scholar?cites=15155592367525002899,,http://iebl.ucsd.edu/sites/iebl.ucsd.edu/files/2017-05/ACS_Nano_Jan_2013.pdf,0,0,0

We report the reversible formation of nanoporosity in individual germanium nanowires during lithiation–delithiation cycling by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Upon lithium insertion. the initial crystalline Ge underwent a two-step phase transformation process: forming the intermediate amorphous LixGe and final crystalline Li15Ge4 phases. Nanopores developed only during delithiation. involving the aggregation of vacancies produced by lithium extraction. similar to the formation of porous metals in dealloying. A delithiation front was observed to separate a dense nanowire segment of crystalline Li15Ge4 with a porous spongelike segment composed of interconnected ligaments of amorphous Ge.

Analysis by means of 1.0-MeV helium ion scattering,1968,Ji W Mayer and L Eriksson and ST Picraux and JA Davies,46,Canadian Journal of Physics,6,663-673,NRC Research Press,The orientation dependence of the backscattered yield of 1.0-MeV helium ions has been used to investigate the lattice characteristics of silicon and germanium implanted at room temperature with 40-keV heavy ions (Ga. As. Sb. In. P). The method gives directly the number of substrate atoms displaced from their lattice sites by more than the Thomas–Fermi screening distance (≈ 0.2 Å) and also the location of the implanted atoms.Each heavy ion is found to displace several thousand lattice atoms in a localized region around its track. At doses where the individual disordered regions do not overlap (~1013 ions/cm2. or less). the silicon lattice reorders at 260 °C and the germanium lattice at 180 °C. At doses greater than ~1014 ions/cm2. a completely amorphous layer is formed in both silicon and germanium.
