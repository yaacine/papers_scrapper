1100697,Effects of fear and anger on perceived risks of terrorism: A national field experiment,2003,Jennifer S Lerner and Roxana M Gonzalez and Deborah A Small and Baruch Fischhoff,14,Psychological science,2,144-150,SAGE Publications,The aftermath of September 11th highlights the need to understand how emotion affects citizens' responses to risk. It also provides an opportunity to test current theories of such effects. On the basis of appraisal-tendency theory. we predicted opposite effects for anger and fear on risk judgments and policy preferences. In a nationally representative sample of Americans (N = 973. ages 13–88). fear increased risk estimates and plans for precautionary measures; anger did the opposite. These patterns emerged with both experimentally induced emotions and naturally occurring ones. Males had less pessimistic risk estimates than did females. emotion differences explaining 60 to 80% of the gender difference. Emotions also predicted diverging public policy preferences.

1100698,Heart strings and purse strings: Carryover effects of emotions on economic decisions,2004,Jennifer S Lerner and Deborah A Small and George Loewenstein,15,Psychological science,5,337-341,SAGE Publications,We examined the impact of specific emotions on the endowment effect. the tendency for selling prices to exceed buying or “choice” prices for the same object. As predicted by appraisal-tendency theory. disgust induced by a prior. irrelevant situation carried over to normatively unrelated economic decisions. reducing selling and choice prices and eliminating the endowment effect. Sadness also carried over. reducing selling prices but increasing choice prices—producing a “reverse endowment effect” in which choice prices exceeded selling prices. The results demonstrate that incidental emotions can influence decisions even when real money is at stake. and that emotions of the same valence can have opposing effects on such decisions.,True,EqDZugoAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1156,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00679.x,1742588003017514496,/scholar?cites=1742588003017514496,,https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1416&context=marketing_papers,0,0,0

Money is often concentrated on a single victim even though more people would be helped. if resources were dispersed or spent protecting future victims. We examine the impact of deliberating about donation decisions on generosity. In a series of field experiments. we show that teaching or priming people to recognize the discrepancy in giving toward identifiable and statistical victims has perverse effects: individuals give less to identifiable victims but do not increase giving to statistical victims. resulting in an overall reduction in caring and giving. Thus. it appears that. when thinking deliberatively. people discount sympathy towards identifiable victims but fail to generate sympathy toward statistical victims.,True,EqDZugoAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,979,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597806000057,7382345853544428484,/scholar?cites=7382345853544428484,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.323.1213&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We show that a very weak form of identifiability—determining the victim without providing any personalizing information—increases caring. In the first. laboratory study. subjects were more willing to compensate others who lost money when the losers had already been determined than when they were about to be.

1100701,The face of need: Facial emotion expression on charity advertisements,2009,Deborah A Small and Nicole M Verrochi,46,Journal of marketing research,6,777-787,SAGE Publications,Advertisements for charities often display photographs of the people they help to evoke the kind of sympathy that engenders giving. This article examines how the expression of emotion on a victim's face affects both sympathy and giving. Building on theories of emotional contagion and sympathy the authors propose that (1) people “catch” the emotions displayed on a victim's face and (2) they are particularly sympathetic and likely to donate when they see sad expressions versus happy or neutral expressions. Consistent with emotional contagion. participants felt sadder when viewing a sad-faced victim. and their own sadness mediated the effect of emotion expression on sympathy. Contagion effects are automatic and noninferential. but they are diminished by deliberative thought.

Using a new experimental paradigm. the authors showed that the framing of situations is a critical driver of gender differences in initiating negotiations. Drawing on literature on language. power. and politeness. the authors argued that framing situations as opportunities for negotiation is particularly intimidating to women. as this language is inconsistent with norms for politeness among low-power individuals. such as women.

The authors propose a theoretical framework for making sense of the vicissitudes of sympathy based on the interaction between two qualitatively different mental processes. One. which the authors term “sympathy.” is caring but immature and irrational. The other process. which the authors term “deliberation.” is rational but uncaring. After proposing a framework for how these two factors interact. the authors first discuss a variety of factors that affect the strength of sympathy. including whether one is in the same state as the victim. one's past and vicarious experiences. proximity. similarity. vividness. and newness. Next. the authors discuss factors that affect the relative influence of deliberation.

In previous attempts to explain these better-than-average and worse-than-average effects. researchers have invoked bias and motivation as causes. In this article. the authors develop a more parsimonious account. the differential information explanation. in which it is assumed only that people typically have better information about themselves than they do about others. When one's own performance is exceptional (either good or bad). it is often reasonable to assume others' will be less so. Consequently. people estimate the performance of others as less extreme (more regressive) than their own.

Among full~ time workers. the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings was estimated to be 75.5% in 2003 (US. Department of Labor. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2000). Many explanations for this gap have been of-fered: Men and women differ in educational attainment (Blau 81 Kahn. 1997); women have more career interruptions than do men. thereby reduc-ing their experience in the labor market (Waldfogel. 1998; Wood. Corcoran. Si Courant. 1993); women and men choose different college majors and therefore develop different skill sets (Haviland. 2003; Kidd 81 Shannon. 1996; Weinberger. 1998); and women and men work in different types of occupations and industries (Blau. Ferber. Si Winkler. 1998; Groshen. 1991; Jacobs. 1999). There is much empirical support for these explanations. Using data from the National Survey of College Graduates. Haviland (2003) found that the gender gap in earnings among White college graduates decreases from 32% to 11% after controlling for all of these factors.

Ltd.,Prior research has confirmed Thomas Schelling's observation that people are more sympathetic and hence generous toward specific identified victims than toward “statistical” victims who are yet to be identified. In the study presented in this article we demonstrate an equivalent effect for punitiveness. We find that people are more punitive toward identified wrongdoers than toward equivalent. but unidentified. wrongdoers. even when identifying the wrongdoer conveys no meaningful information about him or her. To account for the effect of identifiability on both generosity and punitiveness. we propose that affective reactions of any type are stronger toward an identified than toward an unidentified target.

These theories argue that even in the absence of material and reputational benefits. individuals reap utility from the feelings associated with doing good.

Seven studies investigate how bragging about prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds. leading to an attribution of generosity. However. bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus. bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However. bragging does not help—and often hurts—when prosocial behavior is already known. because it signals a selfish motive.

One reason why individuals may not feel satisfied with self-interest is that they feel uneasy about sacrificing the needs of others for their own gain. We propose that externally imposing self-interest allows individuals to enjoy self-benefiting outcomes that are untainted by self-reproach for failing to help others. Study 1 demonstrated that an imposed self-interested option (a reward) leads to greater happiness than does choosing between a self-interested option and a prosocial option (a charity donation). Study 2 demonstrated that this effect is not driven by choice in general; rather. it is the specific trade-off between benefiting the self and benefiting others that inhibits happiness gained from self-interest. We theorize that the agency inherent in choice reduces the hedonic value of self-interest.

We first review research showing (1) that people respond more strongly to identifiable than statistical victims even when identification provides absolutely no information about the victims.(2) that the identifiable victim effect is a special case of a more general tendency to react more strongly to identifiable others whether they evoke sympathy or other emotions. and (3) that identifiability influences behavior via the emotional reactions it evokes. Next. we discuss the normative status of the effect. noting that. contrary to the usual assumption that people overreact to identifiable victims. idenfiability can shift people's responses in a normatively desirable direction if people are otherwise insufficiently sympathetic toward statistical victims. Finally. we examine implications of the identifiable victim effect for public finance. We show that the identifiable victim effect can influence the popularity of different policies. for example. naturally favoring hidden taxes over those whose incidence is more easily assessed. since a hidden tax has no identifiable “victims.” Identifiable other effects also influence public discourse. with much of the debate about government spending and taxation being driven by vivid exemplars–iconic victims and perpetrators--rather than any rational calculation of costs and benefits.,True,EqDZugoAAAAJ:LPZeul_q3PIC,66,https://www.academia.edu/download/30784475/iconic_victims_public_finance.pdf,3009616556570939424,/scholar?cites=3009616556570939424,,https://www.academia.edu/download/30784475/iconic_victims_public_finance.pdf,0,0,0

When a manager observes noisy signals of employee performance and the manager strives to produce accurate ratings but feels worse about unfavorable errors than about favorable errors. the manager’s selfishly optimal ratings will be biased upwards. Both the uncertainty about performance and the asymmetry in the manager’s utility are necessary conditions for performance evaluation inflation. Moreover. the extent of the bias is increasing in the variance of the performance signal and in the asymmetry in aversion to unfair ratings. Uncertainty about performance also leads to compressed ratings. These results suggest that performance appraisals based on well-defined unambiguous criteria will have less bias.

Except in rare cases. the representative agentʼs noise terms cannot be independently and identically distributed across the set of actions. even if that is assumed for the individual agents. This result demonstrates a fundamental difference between a representative agent and truly heterogeneous quantal responders and suggests that when fitting quantal response specifications to aggregate data from a population of subjects. the noise terms should be allowed to be jointly dependent across actions. Even though this introduces additional degrees of freedom. it makes the model well specified.

Most current approaches largely focus on system performance improvement. neglecting management cost in deciding replicas number and their store places. which cause great financial burden for cloud users because the cost for replicas storage and consistency maintenance may lead to high overhead with the number of new replicas increased in a pay-as-you-go paradigm.

Firstly. we design data sets management cost models. including storage cost and transfer cost. Secondly. we use the access frequency and the average response time to decide which data set should be replicated. Then. the method of calculating replicas’ number and their store places with minimum management cost is proposed based on location problem graph.

For any parametric quantal response function arising from a unimodal distribution of exchangeable payoff disturbances. we find that a mis-specified homogeneous rationality parameter will have downward bias. Logit response is one such specification. This result implies that empirical work that disregards heterogeneity underestimates subjects’ rationality.,True,Ey6Eh3kAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,12,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016726811100312X,15624775141824073510,/scholar?cites=15624775141824073510,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.603.259&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

We compare the outcomes in homogenous populations learning in accordance with imitate the best dynamics and with replicator dynamics to outcomes in populations that mix these two learning rules. New outcomes can emerge. In certain games. a linear combination of the two rules almost always attains an equilibrium that homogenous learners almost never locate. Moreover. even when almost all weight is placed on one learning rule. the outcome can differ from homogenous use of that rule. Thus. allowing even an arbitrarily small chance of using an alternative learning style can shift a population to select a different equilibrium.,True,Ey6Eh3kAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,12,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00182-010-0265-3.pdf,9566823839523782112,/scholar?cites=9566823839523782112,,http://dev.gtcenter.org/Archive/2010/Conf/Golman1000.pdf,0,0,0

Social image concerns and other-regarding preferences interact to create incentives to communicate about how one feels about other people.

We observe that a variety of natural systems. including colonies of ants and bees and perhaps even neurons in the human brain. make decentralized decisions using common processes involving information search with positive feedback and consensus choice through quorum sensing. We model this process with an urn scheme that runs until hitting a threshold. and we characterize an inherent tradeoff between the speed and the accuracy of a decision. The proposed common mechanism provides a robust and effective means by which a decentralized system can navigate the speed-accuracy tradeoff and make reasonably good. quick decisions in a variety of environments.

How do players deliberate (intelligently. but perhaps imperfectly) about strategic interdependencies and ultimately decide on a strategy? We address these questions using an evidence accumulation model. with bidirectional connections between preferences for the strategies available to the decision maker and beliefs regarding the opponent’s choices. Our dual accumulator model accounts for a variety of behavioral patterns. including limited iterated reasoning. payoff sensitivity. consideration of risk-reward tradeoffs. and salient label effects. and it provides a good quantitative fit to existing behavioral data.

They assume that people assess the desirability and likelihood of possible outcomes of choice alternatives and integrate this information through some type of expectation-based calculus to arrive at a decision. The authors propose an alternative theoretical perspective. the risk-as-feelings hypothesis. that highlights the role of affect experienced at the moment of decision making. Drawing on research from clinical. physiological. and other subfields of psychology. they show that emotional reactions to risky situations often diverge from cognitive assessments of those risks. When such divergence occurs. emotional reactions often drive behavior.

The prototypical scenario is simple. There is a resource--usually referred to as a common-pool resource--to which a large number of people have access. The resource might be an oceanic ecosystem from which fish are harvested. the global atmosphere into which greenhouse gases are released. or a forest from which timber is harvested. Overuse of the resource creates problems. often destroying its sustainability. The fish population may collapse. climate change may ensue. or the forest might cease regrowing enough trees to replace those cut. Each user faces a decision about how much of the resource to use-how many fish to catch. how much greenhouse gases to emit. or how many trees to cut.

Behavioral decision research over the last 30 years provides a series of lessons about the importance of affect in perceptions of risk and in decisions to take actions that reduce or manage perceived risks. Evidence from a range of domains suggests that worry drives risk management decisions. When people fail to be alarmed about a risk or hazard. they do not take precautions. Recent personal experience strongly influences the evaluation of a risky option.

1100765,Perception of risk posed by extreme events,2002,Paul Slovic and Elke U Weber,,"Regulation of Toxic Substances and Hazardous Waste (2nd edition)(Applegate, Gabba, Laitos, and Sachs, Editors), Foundation Press, Forthcoming",,,,Extreme events. by definition. cause much harm to people. property. and the natural world. Sometimes they result from the vagaries of nature. as in the case of flood. earthquake. or storm. and thus are truly the outcomes of “games against nature.” In other cases they follow technological failure or unintentional human error. as in the case of Chernobyl or Bhopal. putting them also into the category of risks that are predictable only probabilistically. More recently we have witnessed another form of extreme hazard. resulting from terrorism. One of us has termed this “a new species of trouble”(Slovic. in press). since it involves an intelligent and motivated opponent. putting the situations that give rise to these types of extreme events into the domain of economic game theory. The purpose of this brief review is to examine what existing research can tell us about the perception of risk associated with these extreme events. We will also point out issues that remain in need of exploration.During the past quarter-century. researchers have been studying risk intensively and from many perspectives. The field of risk analysis has grown rapidly. focusing on issues of risk assessment and risk management (see Figure 1). The former involves the identification. quantification. and characterization of threats to human health and the environment. The latter. risk management. centers around processes of communication. mitigation. and decision making. Management of extreme events will undoubtedly look to risk assessment for guidance. But risk analysis is a political enterprise as well as a scientific one. and public perception of risk also plays a role in risk analysis …,True,Vp8nPGkAAAAJ:-nhnvRiOwuoC,650,https://eclass.gunet.gr/modules/document/file.php/SOCGU270/6.%20%CE%93%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%20%CF%81%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%BF/perception%20of%20risk.pdf,3877138861102050379,/scholar?cites=3877138861102050379,,https://eclass.gunet.gr/modules/document/file.php/SOCGU270/6.%20%CE%93%CE%B5%CF%89%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%20%CF%81%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%BF/perception%20of%20risk.pdf,0,0,0

The three experiments reported here provide a process-level account for this asymmetry. with implications for designing decision environments that promote less impulsivity.

Whether one considers delayed or accelerated receipt of a gift certificate influences the order in which memory is queried to support immediate versus delayed consumption. and the order of queries affects the relative number of patient versus impatient thoughts.

These decisions provide a clear test of the predictions of the standard economic model of insurance choice in the absence of choice frictions because plans were priced so that nearly every plan with a lower deductible was financially dominated by an otherwise identical plan with a high deductible. We document that the majority of employees chose dominated plans. which resulted in excess spending equivalent to 24% of chosen plan premiums.

For many. selecting a health plan is a source of considerable confusion and distress. The complexity of plan choice arises in part from wide variation among plans across the 4 features that determine how health costs are shared between the insurer and enrollee: the deductible. co-payment. co-insurance. and out-of-pocket spending limits. Consumers aspiring to make an informed choice across plans must evaluate the trade-off between each of these cost-sharing features and premiums. after carefully considering their projected health expenses. because paying for greater cost-sharing makes most sense if a person anticipates significant medical costs.

Addressing these issues directly is difficult and costly. But poor financial outcomes also result from systematic psychological tendencies. including imperfect optimization. biased judgments and preferences. and susceptibility to influence by the actions and opinions of others. Some of these psychological tendencies and the problems they cause may be countered by policies and interventions that are both low cost and scalable. We detail the ways that these behavioral factors contribute to consumers’ financial mistakes and suggest a set of interventions that the federal government. in its dual roles as regulator and employer. could feasibly test or implement to improve household financial outcomes in a variety of domains …,True,vFyQ0v8AAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,16,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/671756/summary,201055458109788105,/scholar?cites=201055458109788105,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/31991/JamisonBSPfinance.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=n,0,0,0

These include interventions to improve health-related behaviors. health insurance access. decisions about insurance plans. end-of-life care. and rates of medical (for example. organ and blood) donation.

Consistent with prior literature. we find that the introduction of the standardized labels only modestly affected purchasing behavior. However. we find that the limited success of the policy is not attributable to inattention to labels. or to the inability of consumers to act in accordance with their attitudes. but rather to the fact that the labels did not meaningfully shift consumer attitudes in favor of healthy eating. We interpret the failure of the labels to shift consumer attitudes as motivating the need for more psychologically informed labels or alternative policies that address the fundamental causes of poor diets.,True,vFyQ0v8AAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,5,https://sabeconomics.org/journal/RePEc/beh/JBEPv1/articles/JBEP-1-1-3-F.pdf,16217702895481521249,/scholar?cites=16217702895481521249,,https://sabeconomics.org/journal/RePEc/beh/JBEPv1/articles/JBEP-1-1-3-F.pdf,0,0,0

We assert that this risk may be shaped by an employee’s initial decision to either confirm enrollment at the default rate or to personalize enrollment at an adjusted rate and that this decision itself may be heavily influenced by non-economic features (eg. the use of visual elements like color. the standardization of language. the salience of previously disclosed plan details) of the (digital) enrollment experience. In collaboration with a major financial provider. we test whether design affects enrollment decisions by randomizing several thousand potential enrollees across 500 plans to digital interfaces that vary only in their “psychological design.” The field studies. supplemented by lab experiments with hypothetical enrollment decisions and a survey of plan administrators. yield five main findings. Our primary contribution is to document the large influence of psychological design on enrollment. The enhanced design we test increased the share of personalized enrollment by 0.09 (0.60 baseline) and full match take-up by 0.11 (0.58 baseline) and raised average contributions by 62 basis points (5.41 percent baseline)—predictively equivalent to expanding the typical plan match by 62%.

1100808,Technological change and retirement decisions of older workers,1993,Ann P Bartel and Nachum Sicherman,11,Journal of Labor Economics,"1, Part 1",162-183,University of Chicago Press,According to human capital theory. technological change will influence the retirement decisions of older workers in two ways. First. workers in industries with high rates of technological change will retire later if there is a net positive correlation between technological change and on-the-job training. Second. an unexpected change in the rate of technological change will induce older workers to retire sooner because the required amount of retraining will be an unattractive investment.

Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost per year of life saved. The analysis adopted the perspectives of the health-care system.

Our model shows that an increase in the pace of technological change increases outsourcing because it allows firms to use services based on leading edge technologies without incurring the sunk costs of adopting these new technologies. In addition. firms using more IT-intensive technologies face lower outsourcing costs of IT-based services generating a positive correlation between the IT level of the user and its outsourcing share of IT-based services.

The focus of the analysis is on “career mobility”. an upward occupational mobility along a series of occupations that forms a worker's career. More educated workers are less likely. on average. to change occupation due to larger amounts of occupational specific investment and also because their careers involve a fewer number of distinct occupations. Within the same occupation of origin. however. more educated workers are more likely to move to a higher level occupation. within the firm (promotion) or across firms.

We argue that firms producing products for which rapid technological change is characteristic will benefit from outsourcing to avoid the risk of not recouping their sunk cost investments when new production technologies appear. This risk is exacerbated when firms produce for low volume internal use. and is mitigated for those firms that sell to larger markets. Hence. products characterized by higher rates of technological change will be more likely to be produced by mass specialized firms to which other firms outsource production. Using a 1990–2002 panel data set on Spanish firms and an exogenous proxy for technological change. we provide causal evidence that technological change increases the likelihood of outsourcing.

1100818,Outsourcing and technological innovations: A firm-level analysis,2008,Ann P Bartel and Saul Lach and Nachum Sicherman,,,,,CEPR Discussion Paper No. DP6731,This paper presents a dynamic model that analyzes how firms' expectations with regards to technological change influence the demand for outsourcing. We show that outsourcing becomes more beneficial to the firm when technology is changing rapidly. As the pace of innovations in production technology increases. the firm has less time to amortize the sunk costs associated with purchasing the new technologies. This makes producing in-house with the latest technologies relatively more expensive than outsourcing. The model therefore provides an explanation for the recent increases in outsourcing that have taken place in an environment of increased expectations for technological change. We test the predictions of the model using a panel dataset on Spanish firms for the period 1990 through 2002. The empirical results support the main prediction of the model. namely. that all other things equal. the demand for outsourcing increases with the probability of technological change.,True,Hs2feeUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,27,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1141637,5896686820680652396,/scholar?cites=5896686820680652396,,https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/34920/1/560201141.pdf,0,0,0

This evidence is the motivation for the development of a model of the relationship between outsourcing and technological change. Our model shows that the distinguishing feature of information technology. namely that it is intensive in its use of skills that can be easily transferred across firms and sectors. generates a technological compatibility between the firm’s use of its own technology and its ability to use others’ technologies. The higher the IT content of the firm’s production technology the lower its adjustment costs and the more likely it is to outsource.

We demonstrate the importance of such sorting for the measurement of social preferences. using two laboratory experiments. First. allowing subjects to avoid environments in which sharing is possible significantly reduces sharing. This reveals the existence of a type of individual who shares reluctantly. preferring to avoid the opportunity to share.

1100832,The focusing and informational effects of norms on pro-social behavior,2009,Erin Krupka and Roberto A Weber,30,Journal of Economic Psychology,3,307-320,North-Holland,This paper reports an experiment examining the effect of social norms on pro-social behavior. We test two predictions derived from work in psychology regarding the influence of norms. The first is a “focusing” influence. whereby norms only impact behavior when an individual’s attention is drawn to them; and the second is an “informational” influence. whereby a norm exerts a stronger impact on an individual’s behavior the more others he observes behaving consistently with that norm. We find support for both effects. Either thinking about or observing the behavior of others produces increased pro-social behavior – even when one expects or observes little pro-social behavior on the part of others – and the degree of pro-social behavior is increasing in the actual and expected pro-social behavior of others. This experiment eliminates strategic influences and thus demonstrates a direct effect of norms on behavior.,True,38LuehEAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,296,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487008001128,6872628786314992752,/scholar?cites=6872628786314992752,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/58977/1/Krupka.pdf,0,0,0

Given the frequency with which large real-world groups. such as firms. face similarly difficult coordination problems. this poses an important question: Why do we observe large. successfully coordinated groups in the real world when they are so difficult to create in the laboratory? This paper presents one reason. The experiments show that. even though efficient coordination does not occur in groups that start off large. efficiently coordinated large groups can be “grown.” By starting with small groups that find it easier to coordinate. we can add entrants—who are aware of the group's history—to create efficiently coordinated large groups.

We use binary dictator games involving a choice between a relatively equitable allocation and an “unfair” allocation that is both less generous and makes the recipient's payment dependent on a p= 0.5 lottery. Dictators choose the unfair option more frequently when the recipient's allocation depends on an ambiguous lottery than on a lottery with a known probability—even though the objective distributions of outcomes are identical under the two kinds of lotteries.

This observation violates the game-theoretic principle that timing of unobserved moves is irrelevant. but is consistent with virtual observability. a theory of how timing can matter without the ability to observe actions.

Over the last few years of the century. the standing and acceptance of behavioral economics changed considerably as many economists took notice of behavioral work and began to accept it as valid economic research. In fact. the change was so sudden and significant that. while at the beginning of the 1990s at most one or two of the top 10 economics departments had a behavioral economist. by the end of the decade at most one or two did not.

Drawing on William James's concept of the material self. we tested a model specifying relationships among sadness. self-focus. and the amount of money that decision makers spend.

The authors propose that donors hold simultaneous yet incongruent preferences of wanting to support beautiful recipients (who tend to be judged as less needy). but believing they should support needy recipients.

What accounts for this difference? Paradigms like the dictator game link each recipient to a single dictator with the implication that each recipient can receive funds from only one person. We argue that this “burden” of responsibility to a single recipient helps to explain high levels of laboratory sharing. In two experiments—a modified dictator game experiment and a charitable giving experiment—participants donated significantly more to others when they were solely responsible for a recipient's outcome than when the responsibility for a recipient was potentially shared.

1100866,Double mental discounting: When a single price promotion feels twice as nice,2018,Andong Cheng and Cynthia Cryder,55,Journal of Marketing Research,2,226-238,SAGE Publications,This research finds that when a single gain has strong associations with multiple costs. consumers often mentally deduct that gain from perceived costs multiple times. For example. with some price promotions (e.g.. spend $200 now and receive a $50 gift card to spend in the future). consumers mentally deduct the value of the price promotion from the cost of the first purchase when they receive the promotion. as well as from the cost of the second purchase when they use the promotion. Multiple mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers' perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are. which can trigger higher expenditures. This mental accounting phenomenon. referred to as “double mental discounting.” is driven by the extent to which gains feel associated. or coupled. with multiple purchases.

Low-warmth donors must therefore send stronger signals of their communal intent when donating to receive the same amount of charitable credit as high-warmth donors.

Here we report that DAP5 is crucial for continuous cell survival in nonstressed cells. The knockdown of endogenous DAP5 induced M phase-specific caspase-dependent apoptosis. Bcl-2 and CDK1 were identified by two independent screens as DAP5 translation targets. Notably. the activity of the Bcl-2 IRES was reduced in DAP5 knockdown cells and a selective shift of Bcl-2 mRNA toward light polysomal fractions was detected. Furthermore. a functional IRES was identified in the 5′UTR of CDK1. At the cellular level. attenuated translation of CDK1 by DAP5 knockdown decreased the phosphorylation of its M phase substrates. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or CDK1 proteins partially reduced the extent of caspase activation caused by DAP5 knockdown. Thus.

Here we show that the 5′ UTR contains three regions with a computer-predicted Y-shaped structure upstream of an AUG codon. each of which can confer some degree of internal translation by itself. In nondifferentiated cells. the entire 5′ UTR is required for maximal basal IRES activity. The elements required for the differentiation-sensing ability (i.e.. D-IRES) were mapped to a 630-nucleotide fragment within the central portion of the 5′ UTR. Even though the region responsible for IRES activation is smaller. the full-length 5′ UTR is capable of mediating the maximal translation efficiency in differentiated cells. since only the entire 5′ UTR is able to confer …,True,7sSi3SIAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC,125,https://mcb.asm.org/content/19/8/5429.short,1126013696615737244,/scholar?cites=1126013696615737244,,https://mcb.asm.org/content/mcb/19/8/5429.full.pdf,0,0,0

We demonstrate that mitotic cells contain heavy polysomes. but these are significantly less translationally active than polysomes in cycling cells. Several observations indicate that mitotic translational attenuation occurs during the elongation stage: (i) in cycling nonsynchronized cultures. only mitotic cells fail to assemble stress granules when treated with agents that inhibit translational initiation; (ii) mitotic cells contain fewer free 80S complexes. which are less sensitive to high salt disassembly; (iii) mitotic polysomes are more resistant to enforced disassembly using puromycin; and (iv) ribosome transit time increases during mitosis. Elongation slowdown guarantees that polysomes are retained even if initiation is inhibited at the same time.

Several recent genome-wide studies reported the identification of potential antisense transcripts for thousands of mammalian genes. many of them resulting from alternatively polyadenylated transcripts or heterogeneous transcription start sites. However. it is not clear whether this transcriptional plasticity is intentional. leading to regulated overlap between the transcripts. or. alternatively. represents a “leakage” of the RNA transcription machinery. To address this question through an evolutionary approach. we compared the genomic organization of genes. with or without antisense. between human. mouse. and the pufferfish Fugu rubripes.

To date. studies have demonstrated that age-related changes occur most extensively in the cognitive domains of memory and executive function.

Such a classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies.

Comparison of proteins encoded in seven complete genomes from five major phylogenetic lineages and elucidation of consistent patterns of sequence similarities allowed the delineation of 720 clusters of orthologous groups (COGs). Each COG consists of individual orthologous proteins or orthologous sets of paralogs from at least three lineages. Orthologs typically have the same function. allowing transfer of functional information from one member to an entire COG.

However. the proximity of CRISPR and cas genes strongly suggests that they have related functions which is hard to reconcile with the repair hypothesis. The protein sequences of the numerous cas gene products were classified into ~25 distinct protein families; several new functional and structural predictions are described. Comparative-genomic analysis of CRISPR and cas genes leads to the hypothesis that the CRISPR-Cas system (CASS) is a mechanism of defense against invading phages and plasmids that functions analogously to the eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi) systems. Specific functional analogies are drawn between several components of CASS and proteins involved in eukaryotic RNAi. including the double-stranded RNA-specific helicase-nuclease (dicer). the endonuclease cleaving target mRNAs (slicer). and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However. none of the CASS components is orthologous to its apparent eukaryotic functional counterpart. It is proposed that unique inserts of CRISPR. some of which are homologous to fragments of bacteriophage and plasmid genes. function as prokaryotic siRNAs (psiRNA). by base-pairing with the target mRNAs and promoting their degradation or translation shutdown.

1101004,[42] Detection and quantification of phosphotyrosine in proteins,1983,Jonathan A Cooper and Bartholomew M Sefton and Tony Hunter,99,,,387-402,Academic Press,This chapter discusses the detection and quantification of phosphotyrosine in proteins. Protein kinases can be differentiated according to their amino acid specificity. Casein kinases of type II and the cAMP-dependent kinases phosphorylate serine. while casein kinases of type I phosphorylate threonine and. to a lesser extent. serine. Another group of kinases with strict specificity for tyrosine is described in the chapter. Most tyrosine-specific protein kinase activities detected to date are implicated in cell growth control. They include the kinases associated with the cell surface receptors for two polypeptide growth factors. epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). and with the transforming proteins of at least five genetically distinct groups of retroviruses.

One of the sites is formed when two regions that are widely separated in the hemagglutinin monomer associate in the assembled trimer.

Contrary to textbook descriptions. the generation of MHC class-I-associated peptides from endogenous proteins is a highly dynamic and remarkably inefficient process.

Surprisingly. each determinant elicits a highly diverse and highly sensitive TCD8+ response. Inefficient antigen processing by virus-infected cells accounts for the poor immunogenicity of just one of the subdominant determinants. Overexpressing class I–peptide complexes using vaccinia virus revealed that the poor immunogenicity of two subdominant determinants reflects limitations in T cell responses unrelated to TCR diversity or sensitivity. Despite greatly enhanced expression. the immunodominant determinant is actually less immunogenic when overexpressed by vaccinia virus.

These poly(A) leaders are non-templated and of heterogeneous lengths; and their function during VACV infection remains a long-standing question. Here. we discovered that a 5’-poly(A) leader conferred a selective translational advantage to mRNA in poxvirus-infected cells. A constitutive and uninterrupted 5’-poly(A) leader with 12 residues was optimal. Because the most frequent lengths of the 5’-poly(A) leaders are 8–12 residues. the result suggests that the poly(A) leader has been evolutionarily optimized to boost VACV protein production. A 5’-poly(A) leader also could increase protein production in the bacteriophage T7 promoter-based vaccinia virus expression system. the prototypic member of poxviruses. Interestingly. although vaccinia virus post-replicative mRNAs do have 5’- methylated guanosine caps and can use cap-dependent translation. in vaccinia virus-infected cells. mRNA with a 5’-poly(A) leader could also be efficiently translated in cells with impaired cap-dependent translation.

We have investigated VACV infection of Drosophila S2 cells. which are useful for protein expression and genome-wide RNAi screening. Biochemical and electron microscopic analyses indicated that VACV entry into Drosophila S2 cells depended on the VACV multiprotein entry-fusion complex but appeared to occur exclusively by a low pH-dependent endocytic mechanism. in contrast to both neutral and low pH entry pathways used in mammalian cells. Deep RNA sequencing revealed that the entire VACV early transcriptome. comprising 118 open reading frames. was robustly expressed but neither intermediate nor late mRNAs were made.

In addition. expression of a reporter gene with a late promoter was achieved by cotransfection of intermediate genes encoding the late transcription factors. The requirement for transfection of DNA templates for intermediate and late gene expression indicated a defect in viral genome replication in VACV-infected S2 cells. which was confirmed by direct analysis.

Whether K-RBP binds DNA through its zinc fingers and the role of zinc finger domain in repressing gene expression are unclear. Here we report that K-RBP binds DNA through its zinc finger domain and the target DNA sequences contain high GC content. Furthermore. K-RBP binds to KSHV ORF57 promoter. which contains a GC-rich motif. K-RBP suppresses the basal ORF57 promoter activity as well as RTA-mediated activation. The zinc finger domain of K-RBP is sufficient for the suppression of ORF57 promoter activation mediated by the viral transactivator RTA.

Remarkably. our data show that VACV replication can be fully rescued from glutamine depletion by asparagine supplementation. By global metabolic profiling. as well as genetic and chemical manipulation of the asparagine supply. we provide evidence demonstrating that the production of asparagine. which exclusively requires glutamine for biosynthesis. accounts for VACV’s preference of glutamine to glucose rather than glutamine’s superiority over glucose in feeding the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Poxviruses are currently being developed as vaccine vectors and cancer therapeutic agents. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol stilbenoid found in plants that has been shown to inhibit or enhance replication of a number of viruses. but the effect of resveratrol on poxvirus replication is unknown. In the present study. we found that resveratrol dramatically suppressed the replication of vaccinia virus. the prototypic member of poxviruses. in various cell types. Resveratrol also significantly reduced the replication of monkeypox virus. a zoonotic virus that is endemic in Western and Central Africa and causes human mortality.

Vaccinia virus (VACV) was used as the vaccine that successfully eradicated smallpox and is a prototypic member of the poxvirus family. Many cellular pathways play critical roles in productive poxvirus replication. These pathways provide opportunities to expand the arsenal of poxvirus antiviral development by targeting the cellular functions required for efficient poxvirus replication. In this study. we developed and optimized a secreted Gaussia luciferase-based. simplified assay procedure suitable for high throughput screening. Using this procedure. we screened a customized compound library that contained over 3200 bioactives and FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved chemicals. most having known cellular targets. for their inhibitory effects on VACV replication. We identified over 140 compounds that suppressed VACV replication. Many of these hits target cellular pathways previously reported to be required for efficient VACV replication. validating the effectiveness of our screening. Importantly. we also identified hits that target cellular functions with previously unknown roles in the VACV replication cycle. Among those in the latter category. we verified the antiviral role of several compounds targeting the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (JAK/STAT3) signaling pathway by showing that STAT3 inhibitors reduced VACV replication.

However. the expression by MVA vectors of large numbers of poxvirus antigens. which display immunodominance over vectored antigens-of-interest for the priming of T cell responses. and the induction of vector-neutralizing antibodies. which curtail the efficacy of subsequent booster immunizations. remain as significant impediments to the overall utility of such vaccines. Thus. genetic approaches that enable the derivation of MVA vectors that are antigenically less complex may allow for rational improvement of MVA-based vaccines.  Principal Findings We have developed a genetic complementation system that enables the deletion of essential viral genes from the MVA genome. thereby allowing us to generate MVA vaccine vectors that are antigenically less complex. Using this system. we deleted the essential uracil-DNA-glycosylase (udg) gene from MVA and propagated this otherwise replication-defective variant on a complementing cell line that constitutively expresses the poxvirus udg gene and that was derived from a newly identified continuous cell line that is permissive for growth of wild type MVA. The resulting virus. MVAΔudg. does not replicate its DNA genome or express late viral gene products during infection of non-complementing cells in culture. As proof-of-concept for immunological ‘focusing’. we demonstrate that immunization of mice with MVAΔudg elicits CD8+ T cell responses that are directed against a …,True,_1nfYFIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,38,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005445,11231713877153282872,/scholar?cites=11231713877153282872,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005445,0,0,0

Both immunogens contained the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which is a known target of antibody-mediated neutralization.

The MVA/S induced a robust antibody response to purified RBD. S1 and S2 whereas MVA/S1 induced an antibody response to the S1 region outside of the RBD region. Both vaccines induced an antibody response in the lung and that was associated with induction of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. MVA/S but not MVA/S1 vaccinated mice generated robust neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 that strongly correlated with RBD antibody binding titers. Mechanistically.

In this report. we use a transgenic mouse model of HBV replication to demonstrate that this assumption may not be true for all viruses. We find that adoptively transferred virus-specific CTLs can abolish HBV gene expression and replication in the liver without killing the hepatocytes. This antiviral function is mediated by IFNγ and TNFα secreted by the CTL or by the antigen-nonspecific macrophages and T cells that they activate following antigen recognition. These cytokines activate two independent virocidal pathways: the first pathway eliminates HBV nucleocapsid particles and their cargo of replicating viral genomes. while the second pathway destabilizes the viral RNA.

It has long been known that most cell types in the body respond to an incoming viral infection by rapidly secreting antiviral cytokines such as interferon alpha/beta (IFN-α/β). After binding to specific receptors on the surface of infected cells. IFN-α/β has the potential to trigger the activation of multiple noncytolytic intracellular antiviral pathways that can target many steps in the viral life cycle. thereby limiting the amplification and spread of the virus and attenuating the infection.

In contrast. a large number of T cell-derived IFN-γ-regulated genes are induced in the liver during viral clearance. reflecting the impact of an adaptive T cell response that inhibits viral replication and kills infected cells. thereby terminating the infection.,True,IwpVn00AAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC,660,https://www.pnas.org/content/101/17/6669.short,10070090439022943341,/scholar?cites=10070090439022943341,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/17/6669.full.pdf,0,0,0

Viral escape could originate from passive mechanisms. such as mutations within crucial CTL epitopes. either affecting major histocompatibility complex binding or T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) recognition. Additionally. it has recently been shown that substitutions of TCR contact sites can yield analogue peptides that can still interact with the T-cell receptor but be unable to deliver a full stimulatory signal. thus inducing anergy 5 or acting as an antagonist for the TCR 6–8. We report here that hepatitis B virus isolates derived from two chronically infected patients display variant epitopes that act as natural TCR antagonists with the capacity to inhibit the CTL response to the wild-type epitope.

Current therapy of patients with chronic HCV infection includes treatment with IFNα in combination with ribavirin. Because most treated patients do not resolve the infection. alternative treatment is essential. RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered antiviral mechanism present in plants and animals that induces double-stranded RNA degradation. Using a selectable subgenomic HCV replicon cell culture system. we have shown that RNAi can specifically inhibit HCV RNA replication and protein expression in Huh-7 cells that stably replicate the HCV genome. and that this antiviral effect is independent of IFN.

1101177,Pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C: immunological features of hepatic injury and viral persistence,1999,Andreas Cerny and Francis V Chisari,30,,3,595-601,WB Saunders,The immune response to viral antigens is thought to be responsible for viral clearance and disease pathogenesis during hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In chronically infected patients. the T‐cell response to the HCV is polyclonal and multispecific. although it is not as strong as the response in acutely infected patients who display a more vigorous T‐cell response. Importantly. viral clearance in acutely infected patients is associated with a strong CD4+ helper T‐cell response. Thus. the dominant cause of viral persistence during HCV infection may be the development of a weak antiviral immune response to the viral antigens. with corresponding inability to eradicate infected cells. Alternatively. if clearance of HCV from the liver results from the antiviral effect of T‐cell–derived cytokines. as has been demonstrated recently for the hepatitis B virus. chronic HCV infection could occur if HCV is not sensitive to such …,True,IwpVn00AAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,605,https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hep.510300312,4020348851290749597,/scholar?cites=4020348851290749597,,https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hep.510300312,0,0,0

Synthetic oligonucleotides were inserted into a plasmid vector containing the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli flanked by sequences from the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of vaccinia virus. The lacZ gene. under control of the synthetic promoter. was introduced into the vaccinia virus genome at the TK locus by homologous recombination. and each of the 122 recombinants thus obtained was assayed for β-galactosidase expression. The relative amounts and 5′ ends of lacZ mRNAs specified by a subset of the recombinants were determined by primer extension.The analysis indicated that late promoters may be considered in terms of three regions; an upstream sequence of about 20 base-pairs. rich in T and A residues. separated by a spacer region of about six base-pairs from a highly conserved (−1)TAAAT(+4) element within which …,True,9blNzp4AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,330,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283689901083,9871947465491968209,/scholar?cites=9871947465491968209,,,0,0,0

Convincing genetic relationships between herpesviruses that infect higher vertebrates (birds and mammals) have been demonstrated previously by comparing proteins predicted from DNA sequences and have been interpreted as a result of evolution from a common ancestor. In order to evaluate how herpesviruses of lower vertebrates fit into this scheme. the 134.226-bp genome of channel catfish virus was sequenced.

These MHC molecules may participate in disease pathogenesis by selectively binding arthritogenic peptides for presentation to autoreactive CD4+ T cells. The nature of the arthritogenic Ag is not known. but recent work has identified posttranslationally modified proteins containing citrulline (deiminated arginine) as specific targets of the IgG Ab response in RA patients. To understand how citrulline might evoke an autoimmune reaction. we have studied T cell responses to citrulline-containing peptides in HLA-DRB1*0401 transgenic (DR4-IE tg) mice. In this study. we demonstrate that the conversion of arginine to citrulline at the peptide side-chain position interacting with the shared epitope significantly increases peptide-MHC affinity and leads to the activation CD4+ T cells in DR4-IE tg mice.

A number of computational tools have been developed for this purpose. but there is a lack of large-scale systematic evaluation of their performance. Herein. we used a comprehensive dataset consisting of more than 10.000 previously unpublished MHC-peptide binding affinities. 29 peptide/MHC crystal structures. and 664 peptides experimentally tested for CD4+ T cell responses to systematically evaluate the performances of publicly available MHC class II binding prediction tools. While in selected instances the best tools were associated with AUC values up to 0.86. in general. class II predictions did not perform as well as historically noted for class I predictions. It appears that the ability of MHC class II molecules to bind variable length peptides. which requires the correct assignment of peptide binding cores. is a critical factor limiting the performance of existing prediction tools. To improve performance. we implemented a consensus prediction approach that combines methods with top performances. We show that this consensus approach achieved best overall performance.

The peptide repertoire of a specific molecule is to a large extent determined by the molecular structure accommodating so-called main anchor positions of the presented peptide. These receptors are extremely polymorphic. and much of the polymorphism influences the peptide-binding repertoire. However. despite this polymorphism. class I molecules can be clustered into sets of molecules that bind largely overlapping peptide repertoires. Almost a decade ago we introduced this concept of clustering human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and defined nine different groups. denominated as supertypes. on the basis of their main anchor specificity. The utility of this original supertype classification. as well several other subsequent arrangements derived by others. has been demonstrated in a large number of epitope identification studies. Following our original approach. in the present report we provide an updated classification of HLA-A and -B class I alleles into supertypes. The present analysis incorporates the large amount of class I MHC binding data and sequence information that has become available in the last decade.

Because of the small methyl group exposed for T cell recognition. these peptides were poor immunogens but effective blockers of DR-restricted antigen presentation. Introduction of bulky and charged residues at positions accessible for T cell recognition yielded extremely powerful Pan DR epitope peptides (PADRE). These peptides elicited powerful responses in vitro from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Because these cells also cross-react on certain mouse class II alleles. we could also demonstrate that PADRE peptides are active in vivo.

The HCV quasispecies in three persistently infected chimpanzees acquired mutations in multiple epitopes that impaired class I MHC binding and/or CTL recognition. Most escape mutations appeared during acute infection and remained fixed in the quasispecies for years without further diversification. A statistically significant increase in the amino acid replacement rate was observed in epitopes versus adjacent regions of HCV proteins. In contrast. most epitopes were intact when hepatitis C resolved spontaneously.

Base-By-Base uses detailed annotation information about the aligned genomes and can list each predicted gene with nucleotide differences. display whether variations occur within promoter regions or coding regions and whether these changes result in amino acid substitutions. Base-By-Base can connect to our mySQL database (Virus Orthologous Clusters; VOCs) to retrieve detailed annotation information about the aligned genomes or use information from text files.

Macrophages and lymphoid dendritic cells differentially present hapten-conjugated Ig. antigen-antibody complexes and hapten-modified self such that hapten-specific B-cell development into IgM-secreting cells is blocked or stimulated. The mechanism by which macrophages inhibit B-lymphocyte differentiation is dependent upon an antigen-specific signal and a second nonspecific signal supplied by macrophage-derived E-series PG. In contrast. non PGE-producing lymphoid dendritic cells promoted maturation to IgM PFC by acting as a powerful stimulator of T-lymphocyte IL-2 production.

1101271,Sedimentation analysis of noninteracting and self-associating solutes using numerical solutions to the Lamm equation,1998,Peter Schuck,75,Biophysical Journal,3,1503-1512,Cell Press,The potential of using the Lamm equation in the analysis of hydrodynamic shape and gross conformation of proteins and reversibly formed protein complexes from analytical ultracentrifugation data was investigated. An efficient numerical solution of the Lamm equation for noninteracting and rapidly self-associating proteins by using combined finite-element and moving grid techniques is described. It has been implemented for noninteracting solutes and monomer-dimer and monomer-trimer equilibria. To predict its utility. the error surface of a nonlinear regression of simulated sedimentation profiles was explored. Error contour maps were calculated for conventional independent and global analyses of experiments with noninteracting solutes and with monomer-dimer systems at different solution column heights. loading concentrations. and centrifugal fields.

In this study. we examine the widely used assumption that most proteins have dn/dc values in a very narrow range. and reappraise the prediction of dn/dc of unmodified proteins based on their amino acid composition. Applying this approach in large scale to the entire set of known and predicted human proteins. we obtain. for the first time. to our knowledge. an estimate of the full distribution of protein dn/dc values. The distribution is close to Gaussian with a mean of 0.190 ml/g (for unmodified proteins at 589 nm) and a standard deviation of 0.003 ml/g.

Because of the use of direct boundary modeling. residuals are available for assessment of the quality of the fits and the consistency of the g*(s) distribution with the experimental data.

The theoretical limiting case of a small. uniformly distributed ligand rapidly reacting with a larger protein in a “constant bath” of the ligand is recapitulated. which predicts the reaction boundary to sediment with a single sedimentation and diffusion coefficient. As a consequence. it is possible to express the sedimentation profiles of reacting systems as c(s) distribution of noninteracting Lamm equation solutions. deconvoluting the effects of diffusion.

Vaccinia virus (VACV). a poxvirus used during the WHO smallpox vaccination campaign. has been involved in zoonotic infections in Brazilian rural areas (Bovine Vaccinia outbreaks – BV). affecting dairy cattle and milkers. Little is known about VACV's natural hosts and its epidemiological and ecological characteristics. Although VACV was isolated and/or serologically detected in Brazilian wild animals. the link between wildlife and farms has not yet been elucidated.  Methodology/Principal Findings In this study. we describe for the first time. to our knowledge. the isolation of a VACV (Mariana virus - MARV) from a mouse during a BV outbreak. Genetic data. in association with biological assays. showed that this isolate was the same etiological agent causing exanthematic lesions observed in the cattle and human inhabitants of a particular BV-affected area. Phylogenetic analysis grouped MARV with other VACV isolated during BV outbreaks.  Conclusion/Significance These data provide new biological and epidemiological information on VACV and lead to an interesting question: could peridomestic rodents be the link between wildlife and BV outbreaks?,True,0nTzklEAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,102,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007428,17939793885602863855,/scholar?cites=17939793885602863855,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0007428,0,0,0

To investigate the role of the H3L protein. we constructed deletion (vH3Δ) and inducible (vH3i) null mutants. The H3L protein was not detected in lysates of cells infected with vH3Δ or vH3i in the absence of inducer. Under these conditions. plaques were small and round instead of large and comet shaped. indicative of decreased virus replication or cell-to-cell spread. The mutant phenotype was correlated with reduced yields of infectious intra- and extracellular virus in one-step growth experiments. The defect in vH3i replication could not be attributed to a role of the H3L protein in virus binding. internalization. or any event prior to late gene expression.

TGF-beta was shown to inhibit IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation. The addition of picograms amounts of TGF-beta to cultures of IL-2-stimulated human T lymphocytes suppressed DNA synthesis by 60-80%.

Certain disorders have vasculitis as the predominant and most obvious manifestation. whereas others have various degrees of vasculitis in association with other primary disorders. Within the entire spectrum of vasculitis virtually any size or type of blood vessel in any organ system can be involved. Most of the vasculitides can be associated directly or indirectly with immunopathogenic mechanisms. In this regard. immune complex mediation is being increasingly recognized as the underlying mechanism in several of the vasculitides. With clinical. pathologic. and immunologic criteria. certain vasculitic disorders can be clearly recognized and categorized as distinct entities. whereas in others there is an overlap of different diseases within a broader category.

We show here that in vitro generated core particles of human hepatitis B virus bind to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells. This only occurred if the cores contained phosphorylated core proteins. Binding was inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin. by antinuclear pore complex antibodies. and by peptides corresponding either to classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) or to COOH-terminal sequences of the core protein. Binding was dependent on the nuclear transport factors importins (karyopherins) α and β.

By contrast. during assembly and egress. subviral nucleoprotein complexes and virions travel back to the plasma membrane. Because diffusion of large molecules is severely restricted in the cytoplasm. viruses use ATP-hydrolyzing molecular motors of the host for propelling along the microtubules. which are the intracellular highways.

1101349,The role of the cytoskeleton during viral infection,2004,K Döhner and B Sodeik,,,,67-108,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Upon infection. virions or subviral nucleoprotein complexes are transported from the cell surface to the site of viral transcription and replication. During viral egress. particles containing viral proteins and nucleic acids again move from the site of their synthesis to that of virus assembly and further to the plasma membrane. Because free diffusion of molecules larger than 500 kDa is restricted in the cytoplasm. viruses as well as cellular organelles employ active. energy-consuming enzymes for directed transport. This is particularly evident in the case of neurotropic viruses that travel long distances in the axon during retrograde or anterograde transport.

Viral particles of neurotropic alphaherpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) show bidirectional transport towards the cell center as well as the periphery. indicating that they utilize microtubule motors of opposing directionality. To understand the mechanisms of specific motor recruitment. it is necessary to characterize the molecular composition of such motile viral structures. We have generated HSV1 capsids with different surface features without impairing their overall architecture. and show that in a mammalian cell-free system the microtubule motors dynein and kinesin-1 and the dynein cofactor dynactin could interact directly with capsids independent of other host factors. The capsid composition and surface was analyzed with respect to 23 structural proteins that are potentially exposed to the cytosol during virus assembly or cell entry. Many of these proteins belong to the tegument. the hallmark of all herpesviruses located between the capsid and the viral envelope.

Single-particle calculations for the L 3 spectra are also discussed. Measured L 3 linewidths are generally larger than those predicted by suitably broadened theory.

Here we have probed the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans. which together with other extremely IR-resistant bacteria have high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios compared to IR-sensitive bacteria. For in vitro and in vivo irradiation. we demonstrate a mechanistic link between Mn(II) ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups. Conditions that inhibited Mn accumulation or Mn redox cycling rendered D. radiodurans radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation. X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that Mn is globally distributed in D. radiodurans. but Fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells. For a group of phylogenetically diverse IR-resistant and IR-sensitive wild-type bacteria. our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation.

The corresponding electron energy loss spectra (EELS) have been recorded in a scanning transmission electron microscope. These results are compared to the C 1s and O 1s spectra of gas phase 1.4-dimethyl terephthalate (the monomer of PET) recorded using EELS. The comparison of monomer and polymer materials in different phases and with different techniques has aided the understanding of the relative strengths and limitations of each technique as well as assisting the spectral interpretation. Good agreement is found in the overall shape and the energies of the spectral features.

In this study. we demonstrate that the development of multidrug resistance in melanomas involves subcellular sequestration of intracellular cytotoxic drugs such as cis-diaminedichloroplatinum II (cisplatin; CDDP). CDDP is initially sequestered in subcellular organelles such as melanosomes. which significantly reduces its nuclear localization when compared with nonmelanoma/KB-3-1 epidermoid carcinoma cells. The melanosomal accumulation of CDDP remarkably modulates melanogenesis through a pronounced increase in tyrosinase activity. The altered melanogenesis manifested an ≈8-fold increase in both intracellular pigmentation and extracellular transport of melanosomes containing CDDP. Thus. our experiments provide evidence that melanosomes contribute to the refractory properties of …,True,SjcLgdcAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,183,https://www.pnas.org/content/103/26/9903.short,12859094355271326057,/scholar?cites=12859094355271326057,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/103/26/9903.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here we describe the 18F-labeling of the RGD-containing glycopeptide cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys(sugar amino acid)-) with 4-nitrophenyl 2-[18F]fluoropropionate and the evaluation of this compound in vitro and in tumor mouse models. Binding assays with isolated immobilized αvβ3. αvβ5. and αIIbβ3 as well as in vivo studies using αvβ3-positive and -negative murine and xenotransplanted human tumors demonstrated receptor-specific binding of the radiolabeled glycopeptide yielding high tumor:background ratios (e.g.. 120 min postinjection: tumor:blood. 27.5; tumor:muscle. 10.2).

To identify breast cancer by increased metabolic activity. parametric FDG-PET images were analyzed for increased tracer uptake applying conventional image reading (CIR) and sensitive image reading (SIR). One hundred eighty-five breast tumors were evaluated by histology. revealing 132 breast carcinomas and 53 benign masses. Results: Breast carcinomas were identified with an overall sensitivity of 64.4%(CIR) and 80.3%(SIR). The increase in sensitivity (SIR) resulted in a noticeable decrease in specificity. from 94.3%(CIR) to 75.5%(SIR). At stage pT1. only 30 (68.2%) of 44 breast carcinomas were detected. compared with 57 (91.9%) of 62 at stage pT2. A higher percentage of invasive lobular carcinomas were false-negative (65.2%) compared with invasive ductal carcinomas (23.7%). Nevertheless. positive PET scans provided a high positive-predictive value (96.6%) for breast cancer. Conclusion: Partial volume effects and varying metabolic activity (dependent on tumor type) seem to represent the most significant limitations for the routine diagnostic application of PET. The number of invasive procedures is therefore unlikely to be significantly reduced by PET imaging in patients presenting with abnormal mammography. However. the high positive-predictive value. resulting from the increased metabolic activity of malignant tissue. may be used …,True,7PzmgK8AAAAJ:6_hjMsCP8ZoC,598,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1033.9626&rep=rep1&type=pdf,11957731591663175104,/scholar?cites=11957731591663175104,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1033.9626&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Several techniques are being studied to enable noninvasive determination of αvβ3 expression. We developed [18F]Galacto-RGD. a 18F-labeled glycosylated αvβ3 antagonist. allowing monitoring of αvβ3 expression with positron emission tomography (PET).   Methods and Findings Here we show by quantitative analysis of images resulting from a small-animal PET scanner that uptake of [18F]Galacto-RGD in the tumor correlates with αvβ3 expression subsequently determined by Western blot analyses. Moreover. using the A431 human squamous cell carcinoma model we demonstrate that this approach is sensitive enough to visualize αvβ3 expression resulting exclusively from the tumor vasculature. Most important. this study shows. that [18F]Galacto-RGD with PET enables noninvasive quantitative assessment of the αvβ3 expression pattern on tumor and endothelial cells in patients with malignant tumors.

Numerous studies have shown that 18F-FDG PET is an accurate test for differentiating residual viable tumor tissue from therapy-induced fibrosis. Furthermore. quantitative assessment of therapy-induced changes in tumor 18F-FDG uptake may allow the prediction of tumor response and patient outcome very early in the course of therapy.

Several techniques are being studied to enable noninvasive determination of αvβ3 expression. We developed [18F]Galacto-RGD. a 18F-labeled glycosylated αvβ3 antagonist. allowing monitoring of αvβ3 expression with positron emission tomography (PET).   Methods and Findings Here we show by quantitative analysis of images resulting from a small-animal PET scanner that uptake of [18F]Galacto-RGD in the tumor correlates with αvβ3 expression subsequently determined by Western blot analyses. Moreover. using the A431 human squamous cell carcinoma model we demonstrate that this approach is sensitive enough to visualize αvβ3 expression resulting exclusively from the tumor vasculature.

1101462,Impact of order and disorder in RGD nanopatterns on cell adhesion,2009,Jinghuan Huang and Stefan V Grater and Francesca Corbellini and Sabine Rinck and Eva Bock and Ralf Kemkemer and Horst Kessler and Jiandong Ding and Joachim P Spatz,9,Nano letters,3,1111-1116,American Chemical Society,We herein present a novel platform of well-controlled ordered and disordered nanopatterns positioned with a cyclic peptide of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) on a bioinert poly(ethylene glycol) background. to study whether the nanoscopic order of spatial patterning of the integrin-specific ligands influences osteoblast adhesion. This is the first time that the nanoscale order of RGD ligand patterns was varied quantitatively. and tested for its impact on the adhesion of tissue cells. Our findings reveal that integrin clustering and such adhesion induced by RGD ligands is dependent on the local order of ligand arrangement on a substrate when the global average ligand spacing is larger than 70 nm; i.e.. cell adhesion is “turned off” by RGD nanopattern order and “turned on” by the RGD nanopattern disorder if operating at this range of interligand spacing.,True,fSgEyHcAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,483,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl803548b,6437833670466763027,/scholar?cites=6437833670466763027,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669488/,0,0,0
1101463,N-methylation of peptides: a new perspective in medicinal chemistry,2008,Jayanta Chatterjee and Chaim Gilon and Amnon Hoffman and Horst Kessler,41,,10,1331-1342,American Chemical Society,  The potential of peptides as drug candidates is limited by their poor pharmacokinetic properties. Many peptides have a short half-life in vivo and a lack of oral availability. Inspired by the excellent pharmacokinetic profile of cyclosporine. a natural. multiply N-methylated cyclic peptide. we envisioned multiple N-methylation as a promising way to rationally improve key pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this Account. we summarize our efforts toward modulating the properties of peptides by multiple N-methylation.As a first step. we simplified the synthesis of N-methylated amino acids in solution. by employing very mild conditions that could be tolerated by the diverse protecting groups required when working with naturally occurring amino acids. We also report the rapid and inexpensive syntheses of N-methylated peptides on a solid support; this facilitated the N-methyl scanning of bioactive peptides.

In order to design low‐molecular‐mass RGD protein antagonists. the determination of the biologically active conformation is a prerequisite. We present a method that yields detailed insight into the steric factors which govern the binding of the ligands to their receptors by systematically scanning the conformational space accessible for the tripeptide sequence RGD. The investigation is based on the conformationally controlled design of homodetic cyclic oligopeptides and their structural determination. coupled with biological assays.

These techniques are particularly advantageous in cases where a limited amount of information is required for solving a chemical problem. e.g.. a few connectivities. coupling constants. or NOE values. Applications of 1D COSY. 1D NOESY. 1D homonuclear relayed techniques. and 1D TOCSY are demonstrated. Furthermore. a variant of the ID COSY. the refocused ID COSY with z filter is suggested. which in combination with 1 D COSY allows the application of DISCO for the determination of coupling constants from multiplets in crowded regions.

Effect of object size.,1979,Edward J Hoffman and Sung-Cheng Huang and Michael E Phelps,3,Journal of computer assisted tomography,3,299-308,,The effect of object size on the capability of positron emission computed tomography to measure isotope concentrations in a cross section was studied. The relationship between the apparent isotope concentration in an image and the true concentration was measured as a function of object size for three instrument resolutions and four convolution filters. The relationship between image size and object size was also measured under the same conditions. Depression of apparent isotope concentration in an image for objects equal in size to the instrument resolution (FWHM) was significant (50% for a cylinder and 25% for a bar). For objects larger than 1.0 FWHM. accurate object sizes can be estimated from the images. Thus. reasonably accurate and practical schemes of compensation for object size effects can be implemented for objects larger than 1.0 FWHM. Accuracy in quantitating isotope concentrations in smaller objects is seriously compromised by the loss of sensitivity to the object size and the large correction factors required to compensate for instrument response. The results of the measurements were found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions for ideal systems of comparable resolution.,True,7duynOgAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,1422,https://europepmc.org/article/med/438372,8830889120128170158,/scholar?cites=8830889120128170158,,,0,0,0

For the 20 nondemented subjects followed longitudinally. memory performance scores did not decline significantly. but cortical metabolic rates did. In APOE-4 carriers. a 4% left posterior cingulate metabolic decline was observed. and …,True,7duynOgAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,822,https://www.pnas.org/content/97/11/6037.short,5242012929948610898,/scholar?cites=5242012929948610898,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/97/11/6037.full.pdf,0,0,0

The two major subtypes of oesophageal cancer are oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC). which are epidemiologically and biologically distinct. OSCC accounts for 90% of all cases of oesophageal cancer globally and is highly prevalent in the East. East Africa and South America. OAC is more common in developed countries than in developing countries. Preneoplastic lesions are identifiable for both OSCC and OAC; these are frequently amenable to endoscopic ablative therapies.

Among the challenges of developing a combined scanner. obtaining attenuation maps for PET reconstruction is of critical importance. This requires accounting for the presence of MR hardware in the field of view. The attenuation introduced by this hardware cannot be obtained from MR data. We propose the creation of attenuation models of MR hardware. to be registered into the MR-based attenuation map prior to PET reconstruction.

Unfortunately. MR images are often unable to encompass the entire patient. The resulting truncation in the transverse plane leads to incomplete attenuation maps. causing artifacts in the reconstructed PET image. This article describes the experiments performed to quantify these artifacts. A method to compensate the missing data was evaluated to determine whether software correction is possible or whether additional transmission hardware has to be included in the scanner.Three studies were made.

Intrinsic motion compensation methods exclusively work on the measured data. without any external motion measurements. Most of these methods separate image from motion estimation: They use deformable image registration/optical flow techniques in order to estimate the motion from individually reconstructed gates. Then. the image is estimated based on this motion information. With these methods. a main problem lies in the motion estimation step. which is based on the noisy gated frames. The more noise is present. the more inaccurate the image registration becomes. As we show both visually and quantitatively. joint reconstruction using a simple deformation field motion model can compete with state-of-the-art image registration methods which use robust multilevel B-spline motion …,True,7g-fXuQAAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,99,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5487394/,2756796538782229265,/scholar?cites=2756796538782229265,,http://campar.in.tum.de/pub/blume2010tmi/blume2010tmi.pdf,0,0,0

Absolute quantification is the key to improve diagnostic performance. to enable comparisons between follow-up examinations and to perform pharmacokinetic modeling. A large fraction of the 511 keV annihilation photons from the positron emitters are scattered by the patient's body. Thus. they are discarded or do not even reach the PET detectors. while others are identified at the wrong location after being scattered. To account for these effects and thus generate quantitative PET images showing the actual activity distribution. it is necessary to determine an attenuation map with the appropriate attenuation coefficients for 511 keV photons at each voxel.

1101571,An approach for MR-based attenuation correction for combined MR/PET: effects of ignoring bones,2007,Axel Martínez-Möller and Michael Souvatzoglou and René Botnar and Nassir Navab and Sibylle Ziegler and Markus Schwaiger and Stephan Nekolla,48,Journal of Nuclear Medicine,supplement 2,156P-156P,Society of Nuclear Medicine,532Objectives: Based on the clinical success of PET/CT systems. MR/PET devices are currently under development as MRI would offer improved soft tissue contrast. However. the MR signal is typically not related to 511 keV photon attenuation as is data from CT. Especially there is a lack for the delineation of bones. In this study. PET/CT data was used to assess the necessity of bone segmentation for attenuation correction. and the option of using two-tissue maps (air/tissue) was studied. Spatially registered PET/CT and MRI data from initial patient studies were used to investigate this approach. Methods: 25 patients were examined using FDG in a Biograph16 PET/CT. Two bed positions (hip. abdomen) were analyzed for each patient. Emission data was attenuation corrected using 3 different attenuation maps (AM): the original CT-based AM. the AM after bone removal (factors above 0.12cm-1 replaced by 0cm-1 …,True,7g-fXuQAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,9,https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/48/supplement_2/156P.1.short,15320385159666081679,/scholar?cites=15320385159666081679,,,0,0,0

We investigated an attenuation map derived from proton-weighted MR data through segmentation into 4 classes: background. lungs. fat and soft tissue. The accuracy of the attenuation and scatter correction in cancer patients using this map as compared to CT-based attenuation maps was evaluated.Methods: 35 oncology patients were examined with FDG in a Biograph16 PET/CT. Regions of interest were manually defined in 52 FDG-avid lesions located in the lungs (15). bones (21) and neck (16). The PET datasets were retrospectively reconstructed using the attenuation map segmented in 4 classes and the changes in SUV were quantified.

As a consequence. there is an urgent unmet clinical need for tracers targeting specifically non-pathogen-driven. inflammatory processes in the heart. Here. we present the potential of a novel PET tracer targeting the expression of the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on inflammatory cells after acute MI. CXCR4 belongs to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors and is involved in biological processes such as the entry of HIV-1. the development of metastasis and several inflammatory conditions. The CXCR4 receptor is expressed only at low levels on the surface of circulating lymphocytes. macrophages. and neutrophils. but is highly upregulated when these cells infiltrate inflamed tissues.

In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric. fully convolutional. neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate. and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function. that we optimise during training. based on Dice coefficient.

Compared to traditional approaches based on point descriptors. which depend on local information around points. we propose a novel method that creates a global model description based on oriented point pair features and matches that model locally using a fast voting scheme. The global model description consists of all model point pair features and represents a mapping from the point pair feature space to the model. where similar features on the model are grouped together.

In such a context. the registration problem is formulated using a discrete Markov random field objective function. First. towards dimensionality reduction on the variables we assume that the dense deformation field can be expressed using a small number of control points (registration grid) and an interpolation strategy. Then. the registration cost is expressed using a discrete sum over image costs (using an arbitrary similarity measure) projected on the control points. and a smoothness term that penalizes local deviations on the deformation field according to a neighborhood system on the grid.

In this paper. we propose a new fully convolutional deep architecture. termed ReLayNet. for end-to-end segmentation of retinal layers and fluid masses in eye OCT scans. ReLayNet uses a contracting path of convolutional blocks (encoders) to learn a hierarchy of contextual features. followed by an expansive path of convolutional blocks (decoders) for semantic segmentation. ReLayNet is trained to optimize a joint loss function comprising of weighted logistic regression and Dice overlap loss. The framework is validated on a publicly available benchmark dataset with comparisons against five state-of-the-art segmentation methods including two deep learning based approaches to substantiate its effectiveness.,True,kzoVUPYAAAAJ:pcWPcJyQGiUC,239,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-8-8-3627,8032880328431199883,/scholar?cites=8032880328431199883,,https://www.osapublishing.org/viewmedia.cfm?seq=0&uri=boe-8-8-3627,0,0,0

Our approach consists of robustly detecting anatomical landmarks in the 3D data and fitting a skeleton body model using constrained inverse kinematics. Instead of relying on appearance-based features for interest point detection that can vary strongly with illumination and pose changes. we build upon a graph-based representation of the depth data that allows us to measure geodesic distances between body parts. As these distances do not change with body movement. we are able to localize anatomical landmarks independent of pose. For differentiation of body parts that occlude each other. we employ motion information. obtained from the optical flow between subsequent intensity images.

However. interpretation of such myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) studies has been primarily qualitative or semiquantitative in nature. assessing regional perfusion defects in relative terms. Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) in absolute terms (milliliters per gram per minute) offer a paradigm shift in the evaluation and management of patients with CAD. The latter is concurrent with the recent shift in the management of CAD from an anatomical gold standard (ie. coronary angiogram) to a functional one.

This is particularly relevant to health care systems with prolonged waiting times for interventions. Myocardial viability imaging with the use of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET may help to identify high-risk patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of prolonged waiting time on cardiac outcomes in patients with left ventricular dysfunction directed to revascularization based on FDG PET imaging. METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-six patients with coronary disease and an ejection fraction of< or= 35% were considered candidates for revascularization based on FDG PET viability imaging. Thirty-five of 46 patients were subsequently accepted for revascularization. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the median waiting time after PET: an early group (< 35 days; n= 18) and a late group (> or= 35 days; n= 17). Preoperative mortality rates were significantly increased in the late group (4 of 17 [24%] versus 0 of 18 in the early group; P< 0.05). In postoperative follow-up (17+/-7 months). cardiac events occurred in 2 of 18 (11%) and 1 of 13 (7.8%) patients in the early and late groups. respectively.

This suggests the existence of more undiscovered common variants. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1.621 hypertensive cases and 1.699 controls and follow-up validation analyses in 19.845 cases and 16.541 controls using an extreme case-control design. We identified a locus on chromosome 16 in the 5′ region of Uromodulin (UMOD; rs13333226. combined P value of 3.6×10−11). The minor G allele is associated with a lower risk of hypertension (OR [95%CI]: 0.87 [0.84–0.91]). reduced urinary uromodulin excretion. better renal function; and each copy of the G allele is associated with a 7.7% reduction in risk of CVD events after adjusting for age. sex. BMI. and smoking status (H.R. = 0.923. 95% CI 0.860–0.991; p = 0.027). In a subset of 13.446 individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements. we show that rs13333226 is independently associated with hypertension (unadjusted for eGFR: 0.89 [0.83–0.96]. p = 0.004; after eGFR adjustment: 0.89 [0.83–0.96]. p = 0.003). In clinical functional studies. we also consistently show the minor G allele is associated with lower urinary uromodulin excretion.

We collected single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles across 10 populations of immunophenotypically defined human hematopoietic cell types and constructed a chromatin accessibility landscape of human hematopoiesis to characterize differentiation trajectories. We find variation consistent with lineage bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent cell types.

Here we discover and characterize the sets of mouse lncRNAs induced by inflammatory signaling via TNFα. TNFα regulates hundreds of lncRNAs. including 54 pseudogene lncRNAs. several of which show exquisitely selective expression in response to specific cytokines and microbial components in a NF-κB-dependent manner. Lethe. a pseudogene lncRNA. is selectively induced by proinflammatory cytokines via NF-κB or glucocorticoid receptor agonist. and functions in negative feedback signaling to NF-κB. Lethe interacts with NF-κB subunit RelA to inhibit RelA DNA binding and target gene activation. Lethe level decreases with organismal age. a physiological state associated with increased NF-κB activity.

Catalytic Brg1 and Brm subunits are required for these processes; however. the roles of SWI/SNF regulatory subunits are not fully understood. Here. we show that ACTL6a/BAF53A modulates the SWI/SNF complex to suppress differentiation in epidermis. Conditional loss of ACTL6a resulted in terminal differentiation. cell-cycle exit. and hypoplasia. whereas ectopic expression of ACTL6a promoted the progenitor state.

Sirt6 can interact with the stress-responsive transcription factor NF-κB and regulate some NF-κB target genes. but the full scope of Sirt6 target genes as well as dynamics of Sirt6 occupancy on chromatin are not known. Here we map Sirt6 occupancy on mouse promoters genome-wide and show that Sirt6 occupancy is highly dynamic in response to TNF-α. More than half of Sirt6 target genes are only revealed upon stress-signaling. The majority of genes bound by NF-κB subunit RelA recruit Sirt6. and dynamic Sirt6 relocalization is largely driven in a RelA-dependent manner. Integrative analysis with global gene expression patterns in wild-type. Sirt6−/−. and double Sirt6−/− RelA−/− cells reveals the epistatic relationships between Sirt6 and RelA in shaping diverse temporal patterns of gene expression. Genes under the direct joint control of Sirt6 and RelA include several with prominent roles in cell senescence and organismal aging. These data suggest dynamic chromatin relocalization of Sirt6 as a key output of NF-κB signaling in stress response and aging.,True,2CdOi4EAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,81,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002153,245539022045534460,/scholar?cites=245539022045534460,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002153,0,0,0

Here we characterize the transcriptional landscape of the four human HOX loci at five base pair resolution in 11 anatomic sites and identify 231 HOX ncRNAs that extend known transcribed regions by more than 30 kilobases. HOX ncRNAs are spatially expressed along developmental axes and possess unique sequence motifs. and their expression demarcates broad chromosomal domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. We identified a 2.2 kilobase ncRNA residing in the HOXC locus. termed HOTAIR. which represses transcription in trans across 40 kilobases of the HOXD locus.

The ability to tether two distinct complexes enables RNA-mediated assembly of PRC2 and LSD1 and coordinates targeting of PRC2 and LSD1 to chromatin for coupled histone H3 lysine 27 methylation and lysine 4 demethylation.

We found 22.163 such coexpression relationships. each of which has been conserved across evolution. This conservation implies that the coexpression of these gene pairs confers a selective advantage and therefore that these genes are functionally related. Manyof these relationships provide strong evidence for the involvement of new genes in core biological functions such as the cell cycle. secretion. and protein expression.

Analysis of these profiles reveals several RNA structural properties of yeast transcripts. including the existence of more secondary structure over coding regions compared with untranslated regions. a three …,True,oAD8PrkAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,731,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09322,4636890129876009365,/scholar?cites=4636890129876009365,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3847670/,0,0,0

However. less is known about the functional consequences of this encoding. Here. we address this question using a genome-wide map of ∼380.000 yeast nucleosomes that we sequenced in their entirety. Utilizing the high resolution of our map. we refine our understanding of how nucleosome organizations are encoded by the DNA sequence and demonstrate that the genomic sequence is highly predictive of the in vivo nucleosome organization. even across new nucleosome-bound sequences that we isolated from fly and human. We find that Poly(dA:dT) tracts are an important component of these nucleosome positioning signals and that their nucleosome-disfavoring action results in large nucleosome depletion over them and over their flanking regions and enhances the accessibility of transcription factors to their cognate sites. Our results suggest that the yeast genome may utilize these nucleosome positioning signals to regulate gene expression with different transcriptional noise and activation kinetics and DNA replication with different origin efficiency. These distinct functions may be achieved by encoding both relatively closed (nucleosome-covered) chromatin organizations over some factor binding sites. where factors must compete with nucleosomes for DNA access. and relatively open (nucleosome-depleted) organizations over other factor sites. where factors bind without competition.,True,oAD8PrkAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,497,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000216,2344046425576332575,/scholar?cites=2344046425576332575,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000216,0,0,0

Using this approach. we identify lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB). a component of glycolytic metabolism. as an essential gene in triple-negative breast cancer. Loss of LDHB abrogated cell proliferation in vitro and arrested tumor growth in fully formed tumors in vivo.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease in which the tyrosine kinases platelet‐derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and Abl are hypothesized to contribute to the fibrosis and vasculopathy of the skin and internal organs. Herein we describe 2 patients with early diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) who experienced reductions in cutaneous sclerosis in response to therapy with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Immunohistochemical analyses of skin biopsy specimens demonstrated reductions of phosphorylated PDGFRβ and Abl with imatinib therapy. By gene expression profiling. an imatinib‐responsive signature specific to dcSSc was identified (P < 10−8). The response of these patients and the findings of the analyses suggest that PDGFRβ and Abl play critical. synergistic roles in the pathogenesis of SSc. and that imatinib targets a gene expression program that is frequently dysregulated in …,True,I1wmKokAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,125,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/art.24221,5856224318116369125,/scholar?cites=5856224318116369125,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/art.24221,0,0,0

In addition. various system-wide interventions in old animals can reverse features of aging.  To better understand these processes. much effort has been put into the study of aging on a molecular level.  In particular. genome-wide microarray analysis of differently aged individual organisms or tissues has been used to track the global expression changes that occur during normal aging.  Although these studies consistently implicate specific pathways in aging processes. there is little conservation between the individual genes that change.

In this study. we show that CDK8 is required for both tumor growth and maintenance of tumor dedifferentiation in vivo and uncover a common role for CDK8 in controlling cancer and stem cell function. Acute CDK8 loss in vivo strongly inhibited tumor growth and promoted differentiation. Transcriptional profiling identified a set of embryonic stem cell–related genes that are activated by CDK8 in cancer. Consistent with this. we found that CDK8 expression correlated to the embryonic stem cell pluripotency state and loss of CDK8 caused embryonic stem cells to differentiate. This effect was. at least partially. mediated by the ability of CDK8 to regulate MYC protein and downstream MYC target gene expression.

In order to dissect the genetic background several linkage and genetic association studies have been performed. Yet very little is known about specific genes involved in this complex skin disease. and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.  Methodology/Findings We used human DNA microarrays to identify a molecular picture of the programmed responses of the human genome to AE. The transcriptional program was analyzed in skin biopsy samples from lesional and patch-tested skin from AE patients sensitized to Malassezia sympodialis (M. sympodialis). and corresponding biopsies from healthy individuals. The most notable feature of the global gene-expression pattern observed in AE skin was a reciprocal expression of induced inflammatory genes and repressed lipid metabolism genes. The overall transcriptional response in M. sympodialis patch-tested AE skin was similar to the gene-expression signature identified in lesional AE skin. In the constellation of genes differentially expressed in AE skin compared to healthy control skin. we have identified several potential susceptibility genes that may play a critical role in the pathological condition of AE. Many of these genes. including genes with a role in immune responses. lipid homeostasis. and epidermal differentiation. are localized on chromosomal regions previously linked to AE.

This ubiquitin ligase. Rsp5. binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167.

Serum stimulation of fibroblasts is well studied as a classic model of entry into the cell division cycle. but the induction of cellular quiescence. such as by serum deprivation (SD). is much less understood. Here we show that SS and SD activate distinct early transcriptional responses genome-wide that converge on a late symmetric transcriptional program. Several serum deprivation early response genes (SDERGs). including the putative tumor suppressor genes SALL2 and MXI1. are required for cessation of DNA synthesis in response to SD and induction of additional SD genes. SDERGs are coordinately repressed in many types of human cancers compared to their normal counterparts. and repression of SDERGs predicts increased risk of cancer progression and death in human breast cancers.

Multiple forms of antibody therapeutics are in use today that differ in the amount of human sequence present in both the constant and variable regions. where antibodies that are more human-like usually have reduced immunogenicity in clinical trials. Here we present a method to quantify the humanness of the variable region of monoclonal antibodies and show that this method is able to clearly distinguish human and non-human antibodies with excellent specificity. After creating and analyzing a database of human antibody sequences. we conducted an in-depth analysis of the humanness of therapeutic antibodies. and found that increased humanness score is correlated with decreased immunogenicity of antibodies. We further discovered a surprisingly similarity in the immunogenicity of fully human antibodies and humanized antibodies that are more human-like based on their humanness score. Our results reveal that in most cases humanizing an antibody and confirming the humanness of the final form may be sufficient to eliminate immunogenicity issues to the same extent as using fully human antibodies.

Inc.,RNA is central to the flow of biological information. From transcription to splicing. RNA localization. translation. and decay. RNA is intimately involved in regulating every step of the gene expression program. and is thus essential for health and understanding disease. RNA has the unique ability to base‐pair with itself and other nucleic acids to form complex structures. Hence the information content in RNA is not simply its linear sequence of bases. but is also encoded in complex folding of RNA molecules. A general chemical functionality that all RNAs have is a 2′‐hydroxyl group in the ribose ring. and the reactivity of the 2′‐hydroxyl in RNA is gated by local nucleotide flexibility. In other words. the 2′‐hydroxyl is reactive at single‐stranded and conformationally flexible positions but is unreactive at nucleotides constrained by base‐pairing.

Experimental evidence suggests that in cancer. they can influence Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC) to retarget to an occupancy pattern resembling that of the embryonic state. We have previously demonstrated that the expression level of lncRNA in the HOX locus. including HOTAIR. is a predictor of breast cancer metastasis. In this current project. RNA in situ hybridization of probes to three different lncRNAs (HOTAIR. ncHoxA1. and ncHoxD4). as well a immunohistochemical staining of EZH2. is undertaken in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues in a high throughput tissue microarray format to correlate expression with clinicopathologic features. Though overall EZH2 and HOTAIR expression levels were highly correlated. the subset of cases with strong HOTAIR expression correlated with ER and PR positivity. while the subset of cases with strong EZH2 expression correlated with an increased proliferation rate. ER and PR negativity. HER2 underexpression. and triple negativity. Co-expression of HOTAIR and EZH2 trended with a worse outcome. In matched primary and metastatic cancers. both HOTAIR and EZH2 had increased expression in the metastatic carcinomas.

Here. we investigate the intramolecular and intermolecular RNA interactions of wildtype (WT) and a mutant (Δ382) SARS-CoV-2 virus in cells using high throughput structure probing on Illumina and Nanopore platforms. We identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome. observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic RNAs. and that WT and Δ382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 29-O-methylated. 29-O-methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global decrease of 29-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs. suggesting that binding to snoRNAs could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs towards the virus genome.

Human telomerase employs a non-coding RNA (hTR) with a bipartite arrangement of domains—a template-containing core and a distal three-way junction (CR4/5) that stimulates catalysis through unknown means. Here. we show that telomerase activity unexpectedly depends upon the holoenzyme protein TCAB1. which in turn controls conformation of CR4/5. Cells lacking TCAB1 exhibit a marked reduction in telomerase catalysis without affecting enzyme assembly. Instead. TCAB1 inactivation causes unfolding of CR4/5 helices that are required for catalysis and for association with the telomerase reverse-transcriptase (TERT). CR4/5 mutations derived from patients with telomere biology disorders provoke defects in catalysis and TERT binding similar to TCAB1 inactivation.

The recent discovery of thousands of lncRNAs in association with specific chromatin modification complexes. such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that mediates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). suggests broad roles for numerous lncRNAs in managing chromatin states in a gene-specific fashion 8.9. While some lncRNAs are thought to work in cis on neighboring genes. other lncRNAs work in trans to regulate distantly located genes. For instance. Drosophila lncRNAs roX1 and roX2 bind numerous regions on the X chromosome of male cells. and are critical for dosage compensation 10.11. However. the exact locations of their binding sites are not known at high resolution. Similarly. human lncRNA HOTAIR can affect PRC2 occupancy on hundreds of genes genome-wide 3.12.13. but how specificity is achieved is unclear. LncRNAs can also serve as modular scaffolds to recruit the assembly of multiple protein complexes. The classic trans-acting RNA scaffold is the TERC RNA that serves as the template and scaffold for the telomerase complex 14; HOTAIR can also serve as a scaffold for PRC2 and a H3K4 demethylase complex 13. Prior studies mapping RNA occupancy at chromatin have revealed substantial insights 15.16. but only at a single gene locus at a time.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) may play a critical role in modulating tissue inflammation via their interactions with both adaptive and innate immune mechanisms. We hypothesized that an imbalance in Tregs is a critical determinant of adipose inflammation and investigated the role of Tregs in IR/obesity through coordinated studies in mice and humans.   Methods and Findings Foxp3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) “knock-in” mice were randomized to a high-fat diet intervention for a duration of 12 weeks to induce DIO/IR. Morbidly obese humans without overt type 2 DM (n = 13) and lean controls (n = 7) were recruited prospectively for assessment of visceral adipose inflammation. DIO resulted in increased CD3+CD4+. and CD3+CD8+ cells in visceral adipose with a striking decrease in visceral adipose Tregs. Treg numbers in visceral adipose inversely correlated with CD11b+CD11c+ adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs). Splenic Treg numbers were increased with up-regulation of homing receptors CXCR3 and CCR7 and marker of activation CD44. In-vitro differentiation assays showed an inhibition of Treg differentiation in response to conditioned media from inflammatory macrophages.

In 2011. the protease inhibitors (PIs) boceprevir and telaprevir in combination with peginterferon (peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) were the first direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) approved in the United States for treatment of genotype (GT) 1 HCV. Several DAAs currently in late-stage clinical trials. including NS3/NS4A serine PIs. NS5A inhibitors. NS5B polymerase inhibitors (both nucleoside and non-nucleoside) and cyclophilin inhibitors. both with and without peg-IFN and RBV. are promising for the treatment of HCV.

The recent discovery of thousands of lncRNAs in association with specific chromatin modification complexes. such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that mediates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). suggests broad roles for numerous lncRNAs in managing chromatin states in a gene-specific fashion 8.9. While some lncRNAs are thought to work in cis on neighboring genes. other lncRNAs work in trans to regulate distantly located genes. For instance. Drosophila lncRNAs roX1 and roX2 bind numerous regions on the X chromosome of male cells. and are critical for dosage compensation 10.11. However. the exact locations of their binding sites are not known at high resolution. Similarly. human lncRNA HOTAIR can affect PRC2 occupancy on hundreds of genes genome-wide 3.12.13. but how specificity is achieved is unclear. LncRNAs can also serve as modular scaffolds to recruit the assembly of multiple protein complexes. The classic trans-acting RNA scaffold is the TERC RNA that serves as the template and scaffold for the telomerase complex 14; HOTAIR can also serve as a scaffold for PRC2 and a H3K4 demethylase complex 13. Prior studies mapping RNA occupancy at chromatin have revealed substantial insights 15.16. but only at a single gene locus at a time.

LNCRNA-HIT in the undifferentiated limb mesenchyme. gut. and developing genital tubercle. In the limb mesenchyme. LncRNA-HIT was found to be retained in the nucleus. forming a complex with p100 and CBP. Analysis of the genome-wide distribution of LncRNA-HIT-p100/CBP complexes by ChIRP-seq revealed LncRNA-HIT associated peaks at multiple loci in the murine genome. Ontological analysis of the genes contacted by LncRNA-HIT-p100/CBP complexes indicate a primary role for these loci in chondrogenic differentiation. Functional analysis using siRNA-mediated reductions in LncRNA-HIT or p100 transcripts revealed a significant decrease in expression of many of the LncRNA-HIT-associated loci. LncRNA-HIT siRNA treatments also impacted the ability of the limb mesenchyme to form cartilage. reducing mesenchymal cell condensation and the formation of cartilage nodules. Mechanistically the LncRNA-HIT siRNA treatments impacted pro-chondrogenic gene expression by reducing H3K27ac or p100 activity. confirming that LncRNA-HIT is essential for chondrogenic differentiation in the limb mesenchyme.

EZH2 is part of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and trimethylates H3K27. This histone mark recruits the BMI1-containing PRC1 that silences the genes marked by PRC2. Based on their role in stem cells. EZH2 and BMI1 have been predicted to contribute to a poor outcome for cancer patients. We have analysed the expression of EZH2 and BMI1 in a well-characterised dataset of 295 human breast cancer samples. Interestingly. although EZH2 overexpression correlates with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. BMI1 overexpression correlates with a good outcome. Although this may reflect transformation of different cell types. we also observed a functional difference. The PcG-target genes INK4A and ARF are not expressed in tumours with high BMI1. but they are expressed in tumours with EZH2 overexpression. ARF expression results in tumour protein P53 (TP53) activation. and we found a significantly higher proportion of TP53 mutations in tumours with high EZH2. This may explain why tumours with high EZH2 respond poorly to therapy. in contrast to tumours with high BMI1. Overall. our data highlight that whereas EZH2 and BMI1 may function in a 'linear' pathway in normal development. their overexpression has different functional consequences for breast tumourigenesis.,True,JXSk5nEAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,133,https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr2214,18288676672401504217,/scholar?cites=18288676672401504217,,https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/bcr2214,0,0,0

Series B (Methodological),,267-288,Blackwell Publishers,We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree‐based models are briefly described.,True,ZpG_cJwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,38152,https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x,18267824843611228908,/scholar?cites=18267824843611228908,,https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/eelhami/courses/EE290A/LASSO_Tibshirani.pdf,0,0,0

We propose the ‘fused lasso’. a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1‐norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences—i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile.

1102114,The lasso method for variable selection in the Cox model,1997,Robert Tibshirani,16,Statistics in medicine,4,385-395,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.,I propose a new method for variable selection and shrinkage in Cox's proportional hazards model. My proposal minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint. it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. As a result it reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable final model. The method is a variation of the ‘lasso’ proposal of Tibshirani. designed for the linear regression context. Simulations indicate that the lasso can be more accurate than stepwise selection in this setting. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons.

An algorithm of this kind has been proposed for the L 1-penalized regression (lasso) in the literature. but it seems to have been largely ignored. Indeed. it seems that coordinate-wise algorithms are not often used in convex optimization. We show that this algorithm is very competitive with the well-known LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems. and that it can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net. It turns out that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the “fused lasso.” however. so we derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer. Finally. we generalize the procedure to the two-dimensional fused lasso. and demonstrate its performance on some image smoothing problems.,True,ZpG_cJwAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,2120,https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1196438020,1220178226765139551,/scholar?cites=1220178226765139551,,https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aoas/1196438020,0,0,0

Transcriptional control involves the establishment of physical connections among genes and regulatory elements. both along and between chromosomes. Recent technological innovations in probing the folding of chromosomes are providing new insights into the spatial organization of genomes and its role in gene regulation. It is emerging that folding of large complex chromosomes involves a hierarchy of structures. from chromatin loops that connect genes and enhancers to larger chromosomal domains and nuclear compartments.

Here. we examined the mechanism for DNA looping at the β-globin locus. By using chromosome conformation capture (3C). we show that the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 and its cofactor FOG-1 are required for the physical interaction between the β-globin locus control region (LCR) and the β-major globin promoter. Kinetic studies reveal that GATA-1-induced loop formation correlates with the onset of β-globin transcription and occurs independently of new protein synthesis. GATA-1 occupies the β-major globin promoter normally in fetal liver erythroblasts from mice lacking the LCR. suggesting that GATA-1 binding to the promoter and LCR are independent events that occur prior to loop formation.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine. biology. finance. and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics. and spawned new areas such as data mining. machine learning. and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical. the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given. with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad. from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning.

A total of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing 78 cancers. three fibroadenomas. and four normal breast tissues were analyzed by hierarchical clustering. As reported previously. the cancers could be classified into a basal epithelial-like group. an ERBB2-overexpressing group and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression. A novel finding was that the previously characterized luminal epithelial/estrogen receptor-positive group could be divided into at least two subgroups. each with a distinctive expression profile.

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso. while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition. the elastic net encourages a grouping effect. where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast. the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫ n case.

Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms. this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles. namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem. boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting.

However. PCA suffers from the fact that each principal component is a linear combination of all the original variables. thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. We introduce a new method called sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) using the lasso (elastic net) to produce modified principal components with sparse loadings.

An algorithm of this kind has been proposed for the L 1-penalized regression (lasso) in the literature. but it seems to have been largely ignored.

We show that this algorithm is very competitive with the well-known LARS (or homotopy) procedure in large lasso problems. and that it can be applied to related methods such as the garotte and elastic net. It turns out that coordinate-wise descent does not work in the “fused lasso.” however. so we derive a generalized algorithm that yields the solution in much less time that a standard convex optimizer.

Despite parallels in cellular behavior between cancer progression and wound healing. the molecular relationships between these two processes and their prognostic implications are unclear. In this study. based on gene expression profiles of fibroblasts from ten anatomic sites. we identify a stereotyped gene expression program in response to serum exposure that appears to reflect the multifaceted role of fibroblasts in wound healing. The genes comprising this fibroblast common serum response are coordinately regulated in many human tumors. allowing us to identify tumors with gene expression signatures suggestive of active wounds. Genes induced in the fibroblast serum-response program are expressed in tumors by the tumor cells themselves. by tumor-associated fibroblasts. or both. The molecular features that define this wound-like phenotype are evident at an early clinical stage. persist during treatment. and predict increased risk of metastasis and death in breast. lung. and gastric carcinomas.

Gene shaving differs from hierarchical clustering and other widely used methods for analyzing gene expression studies in that genes may belong to more than one cluster. and the clustering may be supervised by an outcome measure. The technique can be 'unsupervised'. that is. the genes and samples are treated as unlabeled. or partially or fully supervised by using known properties of the genes or samples to assist in finding meaningful groupings. We illustrate the use of the gene shaving method to analyze gene expression measurements made on samples from patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

Here. we identified calreticulin as a pro-phagocytic signal that was highly expressed on the surface of several human cancers. but was minimally expressed on most normal cells. Increased CD47 expression correlated with high amounts of calreticulin on cancer cells and was necessary for protection from calreticulin-mediated …,True,KRkHmBIAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,481,https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/2/63/63ra94.short,2614915727659506341,/scholar?cites=2614915727659506341,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4126904/,0,0,0

To investigate the molecular choreography of this response. we carried out a systematic examination of the gene expression program in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells responding to bacteria and bacterial products. We found a remarkably stereotyped program of gene expression induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and diverse killed bacteria. An intricately choreographed expression program devoted to communication between cells was a prominent feature of the response. Other features suggested a molecular program for commitment of antigen-presenting cells to antigens captured in the context of bacterial infection. Despite the striking similarities. there were qualitative and quantitative differences in the responses to different bacteria.

We used cDNA microarrays to characterize the genomic expression program in human peripheral T cells responding to stimulation of these receptors. We found that CD28 agonists alone elicited few. but reproducible. changes in gene expression. whereas CD3 agonists elicited a multifaceted temporally choreographed gene expression program. The principal effect of simultaneous engagement of CD28 was to increase the amplitude of the CD3 transcriptional response. The induced genes whose expression was most enhanced by costimulation were significantly enriched for known targets of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors.

Ltd.,As a result of progress on the human genome project. approximately 19 000 genes have been identified and tens of thousands more tentatively identified as partial fragments of genes termed expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Most of these genes are only partially characterized and the functions of the vast majority are as yet unknown. It is likely that many genes that might be useful for diagnosis and/or prognostication of human malignancies have yet to be recognized. The advent of cDNA microarray technology now allows the efficient measurement of expression for almost every gene in the human genome in a single overnight hybridization experiment.

1102229,Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation,2011,Christopher Granger,365,New England Journal of Medicine,11,981-992,Massachusetts Medical Society,Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin.In this randomized. double-blind trial. we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio. 2.0 to 3.0) in 18.201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority. with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause.The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years.

1102252,The physiology of the grid: An open grid services architecture for distributed systems integration,2002,Ian Foster,,,,,,In both e-business and e-science. we often need to integrate services across distributed. heterogeneous. dynamic “virtual organizations” formed from the disparate resources within a single enterprise and/or from external resource sharing and service provider relationships. This integration can be technically challenging because of the need to achieve various qualities of service when running on top of different native platforms. We present an Open Grid Services Architecture that addresses these challenges. Building on concepts and technologies from the Grid and Web services communities. this architecture defines a uniform exposed service semantics (the Grid service); defines standard mechanisms for creating. naming. and discovering transient Grid service instances; provides location transparency and multiple protocol bindings for service instances; and supports integration with underlying native platform facilities. The Open Grid Services Architecture also defines. in terms of Web Services Description Language (WSDL) interfaces and associated conventions. mechanisms required for creating and composing sophisticated distributed systems. including lifetime management. change management. and notification. Service bindings can support reliable invocation. authentication. authorization. and delegation. if required. Our presentation complements an earlier foundational article.“The Anatomy of the Grid.” by describing how Grid mechanisms can implement a service-oriented architecture. explaining how Grid functionality can be incorporated into a Web services framework. and illustrating how our architecture can be applied within …,True,VGoSakQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,5348,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.137.5856,930198472278645308,/scholar?cites=930198472278645308,,,0,0,0

Berlin. Heidelberg,Metacomputing systems are intended to support remote and/or concurrent use of geographically distributed computational resources. Resource management in such systems is complicated by five concerns that do not typically arise in other situations: site autonomy and heterogeneous substrates at the resources. and application requirements for policy extensibility. co-allocation. and online control. We describe a resource management architecture that addresses these concerns. This architecture distributes the resource management problem among distinct local manager. resource broker. and resource co-allocator components and defines an extensible resource specification language to exchange information about requirements.

1102273,The physiology of the grid: An open grid services architecture for distributed systems integration,2002,Ian Foster,,,,,,In both e-business and e-science. we often need to integrate services across distributed. heterogeneous. dynamic “virtual organizations” formed from the disparate resources within a single enterprise and/or from external resource sharing and service provider relationships. This integration can be technically challenging because of the need to achieve various qualities of service when running on top of different native platforms. We present an Open Grid Services Architecture that addresses these challenges. Building on concepts and technologies from the Grid and Web services communities. this architecture defines a uniform exposed service semantics (the Grid service); defines standard mechanisms for creating. naming. and discovering transient Grid service instances; provides location transparency and multiple protocol bindings for service instances; and supports integration with underlying native platform facilities. The Open Grid Services Architecture also defines. in terms of Web Services Description Language (WSDL) interfaces and associated conventions. mechanisms required for creating and composing sophisticated distributed systems. including lifetime management. change management. and notification. Service bindings can support reliable invocation. authentication. authorization. and delegation. if required.

1102289,The Nexus approach to integrating multithreading and communication,1996,Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman and Steven Tuecke,37,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,1,70-82,Academic Press,Lightweight threads have an important role to play in parallel systems: they can be used to exploit shared-memory parallelism. to mask communication and I/O latencies. to implement remote memory access. and to support task-parallel and irregular applications. In this paper. we address the question of how to integrate threads and communication in high-performance distributed-memory systems. We propose an approach based on global pointer and remote service request mechanisms. and explain how these mechanisms support dynamic communication structures. asynchronous messaging. dynamic thread creation and destruction. and a global memory model via interprocessor references. We also explain how these mechanisms can be implemented in various environments. Our global pointer and remote service request mechanisms have been incorporated in a runtime system called Nexus that is used as a …,True,sJUhflQAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,431,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731596901082,16154644898081125618,/scholar?cites=16154644898081125618,,https://www.academia.edu/download/51435364/foster96nexus.pdf,0,0,0

Such applications arise. for example. in experimental physics. where the data in question is generated by accelerators. and in simulation science. where the data is generated by supercomputers. So-called Data Grids provide essential infrastructure for such applications. much as the Internet provides essential services for applications such as e-mail and the Web.

Data access mechanisms are required that place limited functionality demands on an application or host system yet permit high-performance implementations. To address these requirements. we prcpose a data movement and access service called Global Access to Secondary Storage (GASS). This service defines a global name space via Uniform Resource Locators and allows applications to access remote files via standard I/O interfaces. High performance is achieved by incorporating de fault data movement strategies that are specialized for IjO patterns common in wide area applications and by providing support for programmer management of data movement.

It introduces the idea of a stateful Web services and defines approaches for creating. naming. and managing the lifetime of instances of services; for declaring and inspecting service state data; for asynchronous notification of service state change; for representing and managing collections of service instances; and for common handling of service invocation faults. In January 2004. the WS-Resource Framework was proposed as a refactoring and evolution of OGSI aimed at exploiting new Web services standards. specifically WS-Addressing. and at evolving OGSI based on early implementation and application experiences. The WS-Resource Framework retains essentially all of the functional capabilities present in OGSI. while changing some of the syntax (eg. to exploit WS-Addressing) and also adopting a different terminology in its presentation. In addition. the WS-Resource Framework partitions OGSI functionality into five distinct. composable specifications.

These VOs often wish to define and enforce consistent policies in addition to the policies of their underlying domains. This is challenging. not only because of the problems in distributing the policy to the domains. but also because of the fact that those domains may each have different capabilities for enforcing the policy. The Community Authorization Service (CAS) solves this problem by allowing resource providers to delegate some policy authority to the VO while maintaining ultimate control over their resources.

A good allocation is critical for efficient execution. However. many existing grid toolkits use matchmaking strategies that do not consider overall efficiency for the set of tasks to be run. We identify two families of resource allocation algorithms: task-based algorithms. that greedily allocate tasks to resources. and workflow-based algorithms. that search for an efficient allocation for the entire workflow. We compare the behavior of workflow-based algorithms and task-based algorithms. using simulations of workflows drawn from a real application and with varying ratios of computation cost to data transfer cost.

These workflows describe the execution of a complex application built from individual application components. In our work we have developed two workflow generators: the first (the Concrete Workflow Generator CWG) maps an abstract workflow defined in terms of application-level components to the set of available Grid resources. The second generator (Abstract and Concrete Workflow Generator. ACWG) takes a wider perspective and not only performs the abstract to concrete mapping but also enables the construction of the abstract workflow based on the available components. This system operates in the application domain and chooses application components based on the application metadata attributes.

CA; Cambridge. MA; London; AAAI Press; MIT Press; 1999,Scientific workflows are being developed for many domains as a useful paradigm to manage complex scientific computations. In our work. we are challenged with efficiently generating and validating workflows that contain large amounts (hundreds to thousands) of individual computations to be executed over distributed environments. This paper describes a new approach to workflow creation that uses semantic representations to describe compactly complex scientific applications in a dataindependent manner. then automatically generates workflows of computations for given data sets. and finally maps them to available computing resources. The semantic representations are used to automatically generate descriptions for each of the thousands of new data products. We interleave the creation of the workflow with its execution. which allows intermediate execution data products to influence the generation of the following portions of the workflow. We have implemented this approach in Wings. a workflow creation system that combines semantic representations with planning techniques. We have used Wings to create workflows of thousands of computations. which are submitted to the Pegasus mapping system for execution over distributed computing environments.

Typically. the next step after a GWAS is to genotype the top signals in an independent replication sample. Investigators will often incorporate information from biological databases so that biologically relevant SNPs. such as those in genes related to the phenotype or with potentially non-neutral effects on gene expression such as a splice sites. are given higher priority.

The portal also includes components for generating abstract workflows based on a metadata description of the desired data products and application-specific services.

Generally. users are given access to a collection of resources that can be used for execution. The collection of resources can be dynamic. and the users must decide which collection of heterogeneous and distributed resources to use. However. many users often do not have knowledge of all of the resource performance characteristics on which to make informed decisions and therefore need automated tools to perform the mapping of jobs to the available resources. In this paper. we present a resource planner system that uses performance prediction. based upon historical data. to identify the appropriate resources. This system is used with a gravitational-wave physics experiment.

We compare the behavior of workflow-based algorithms and task-based algorithms. using simulations of workflows drawn from a real application and with varying ratios of computation cost to data transfer cost.

Most prior work on trusts focuses on entity-centered issues such as authentication and reputation and does not take into account the content. i.e.. the nature and use of the information being exchanged. This paper defines content trust and discusses it in the context of other trust measures that have been previously studied. We introduce several factors that users consider in deciding whether to trust the content provided by a Web resource. Our goal is to discern which of these factors could be captured in practice with minimal user interaction in order to maximize the quality of the system's trust estimates.

A good allocation is critical for efficient execution. However. many existing grid toolkits use matchmaking strategies that do not consider overall efficiency for the set of tasks to be run.

We compare the behavior of workflow-based algorithms and task-based algorithms. using simulations of workflows drawn from a real application and with varying ratios of computation cost to data transfer cost.

In past work. we have developed several plan evaluation systems in these domains. and have integrated them in several occasions with plan editors and plan generation systems. For each of these integrations. and often for each system in the integration. a new format for exchanging plans was devised. PLANET can represent all of the plans that we and others have used in these domains. providing a standard universal format for knowledge sharing that can be used as an interlingua in integrated planning applications.

The events are represented by enabling conditions and probabilities of occurrence. The planner is goal-directed and backward chaining. but the subgoals are suggested by analysing the probability of success of the partial plan rather than being simply the open conditions of the operators in the plan. The partial plan is represented as a Bayesian belief net to compute its probability of success. Since calculating the probability of success of a plan can be very expensive I introduce two other techniques for computing it. one that uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate it and one based on a Markov chain representation that uses knowledge about the dependencies between the predicates describing the domain.,True,hIETYPwAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,78,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781558603325500171,17812219907339267220,/scholar?cites=17812219907339267220,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.6791,0,0,0
1102421,Workarounds to computer access in healthcare organizations: you want my password or a dead patient?,2015,Ross Koppel and Sean W Smith and Jim Blythe and Vijay H Kothari,15,ITCH,4,215-220,,Workarounds to computer access in healthcare are sufficiently common that they often go unnoticed. Clinicians focus on patient care. not cybersecurity. We argue and demonstrate that understanding workarounds to healthcare workers’ computer access requires not only analyses of computer rules. but also interviews and observations with clinicians. In addition. we illustrate the value of shadowing clinicians and conducing focus groups to understand their motivations and tradeoffs for circumvention. Ethnographic investigation of the medical workplace emerges as a critical method of research because in the inevitable conflict between even well-intended people versus the machines. it’s the people who are the more creative. flexible. and motivated. We conducted interviews and observations with hundreds of medical workers and with 19 cybersecurity experts. CIOs. CMIOs. CTO. and IT workers to obtain their perceptions of computer security. We also shadowed clinicians as they worked. We present dozens of ways workers ingeniously circumvent security rules. The clinicians we studied were not “black hat” hackers. but just professionals seeking to accomplish their work despite the security technologies and regulations.,True,hIETYPwAAAAJ:DTjSuSUbmXsC,72,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8a42/1388b5fd5af79764294d2090502d6b5eef3d.pdf#page=232,10356240384227479755,/scholar?cites=10356240384227479755,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8a42/1388b5fd5af79764294d2090502d6b5eef3d.pdf#page=232,0,0,0

1102423,Planning under uncertainty in dynamic domains,1997,Jim Blythe,,,,,,Planning. the process of nding a course of action which can be executed to achieve some goal. is an important and well-studied area of AI. One of the central assumptions of classical AI-based planning is that after performing an action the resulting state can be predicted completely and with certainty. This assumption has allowed the development of planning algorithms that provably achieve their goals. but it has also hindered the use of planners in many real-world applications because of their inherent uncertainty.Recently. several planners have been implemented that reason probabilistically about the outcomes of actions and the initial state of a planning problem. However. their representations and algorithms do not scale well enough to handle large problems with many sources of uncertainty. This thesis introduces a probabilistic planning algorithm that can handle such problems by focussing on a smaller set of relevant sources of uncertainty. maintained as the plan is developed. This is achieved by using the candidate plan to constrain the sources of uncertainty that are considered. incrementally considering more sources as they are shown to be relevant. The algorithm is demonstrated in an implemented planner. called Weaver. that can handle uncertainty about actions taken by external agents. in addition to the kinds of uncertainty handled in previous planners. External agents may cause many simultaneous changes to the world that are not relevant to the success of a plan. making the ability to determine and ignore irrelevant events a crucial requirement for an e cient planner. Three additional techniques are presented that improve the …,True,hIETYPwAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,70,http://ra.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/usr0/ftp/1998/CMU-CS-98-147.pdf,17032203890888196159,/scholar?cites=17032203890888196159,,http://ra.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/usr0/ftp/1998/CMU-CS-98-147.pdf,0,0,0

The incorporation of commercial off-the-shelf technologies in energy control systems makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks. A taxonomy of cyber attacks against control systems can assist the energy sector in managing the cyber threat. This paper takes the first step towards a taxonomy by presenting a comprehensive model of attacks. vulnerabilities and damage related to control systems. The model is populated based on a survey of the technical literature from industry. academia and national laboratories.,True,6lqBe44AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,78,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-88523-0_6,14569665656147163727,/scholar?cites=14569665656147163727,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-88523-0_6.pdf,0,0,0

Researchers have shown that TN is indeed a viable solution for these environments by developing a number of policy languages and strategies for TN which have desirable theoretical properties. Further. existing protocols. such as TLS. have been altered to interact with prototype TN systems. thereby illustrating the utility of TN. Unfortunately. modifying existing protocols is often a time-consuming and bureaucratic process which can hinder the adoption of this promising technology.

1102463,Workflow task clustering for best effort systems with Pegasus,2008,Gurmeet Singh and Mei-Hui Su and Karan Vahi and Ewa Deelman and Bruce Berriman and John Good and Daniel S Katz and Gaurang Mehta,,,,9,ACM,Many scientific workflows are composed of fine computational granularity tasks. yet they are composed of thousands of them and are data intensive in nature. thus requiring resources such as the TeraGrid to execute efficiently. In order to improve the performance of such applications. we often employ task clustering techniques to increase the computational granularity of workflow tasks. The goal is to minimize the completion time of the workflow by reducing the impact of queue wait times. In this paper. we examine the performance impact of the clustering techniques using the Pegasus workflow management system. Experiments performed using an astronomy workflow on the NCSA TeraGrid cluster show that clustering can achieve a significant reduction in the workflow completion time (up to 97%).,True,1I4dbdAAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,125,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1341811.1341822,8071144922008757972,/scholar?cites=8071144922008757972,,https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/Montage/publications/a9-singh.pdf,0,0,0

To enable and ensure the replicability and traceability of scientific claims. it is essential that the scientific publication. the corresponding datasets. and the data analysis are made publicly available [1. 2]. All software used for the analysis should be either carefully documented (eg. for commercial software) or. better yet. openly shared and directly accessible to others [3. 4]. The rise of openly available software and source code alongside concomitant collaborative development is facilitated by the existence of several code repository services such as SourceForge. Bitbucket. GitLab. and GitHub. among others. These resources are also essential for collaborative software projects because they enable the organization and sharing of programming tasks between different remote contributors.

Much recent research has attempted to determine the benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing for scientific applications. Although clouds have many attractive features. such as virtualization. on-demand provisioning. and ¿pay as you go¿ usage-based pricing. it is not clear whether they are able to deliver the performance required for scientific applications at a reasonable price. In this paper we examine the performance and cost of clouds from the perspective of scientific workflow applications. We use three characteristic workflows to compare the performance of a commercial cloud with that of a typical HPC system. and we analyze the various costs associated with running those workflows in the cloud.

The source model corresponds to that of an independent inversion study. and the material model used is a community velocity model (CVM) developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC).

Beneath old ocean basins the thickness of the c.b.l. (ca. 40 km) is less than that of either the m.b.l. (ca. 100 km) or the t.b.l.

We therefore examine an alternate model which postulates a much thicker c.b.l. beneath the cratons whose mantle component consists of a low-density peridotite depleted in its basaltic constituents. On the basis of seismological and petrological data it is inferred that this augmented c.b.l. extends below the m.b.l. to depths exceeding 150 km and acts to stabilize a thick ( > 200 km) t.b.l. against convective disruption.

1102545,Gridant: A client-controllable grid workflow system,2004,Kaizar Amin and Gregor von Laszewski and Mihael Hategan and Nestor J Zaluzec and Shawn Hampton and Albert Rossi,,,,10 pp.,IEEE,Process management is an extremely important concept in both business and scientific communities. Several workflow management tools have been proposed in recent years offering advanced functionality in various domains. In the business world. workflow vendors offer commercial and customized solutions targeting specific users. In the scientific world. several open-source workflow management tools are freely available. However they are directed toward service aggregation rather than distributed process management. Little consideration is given to the needs of the client in terms of mapping the process flow of the client. In the grid community it is essential that the grid users have such a tool available enabling them to orchestrate complex work-flows on the fly without substantial help from the service providers. At the same time it is important that the grid user not be burdened with the intricacies of the workflow …,True,jdHOOEYAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,226,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1265491/,8064924365161171135,/scholar?cites=8064924365161171135,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42917786/GridAnt_A_client-controllable_Grid_Work_20160221-25897-1w7pq00.pdf,0,0,0

In the parallel genetic algorithm the selection of a mate is restricted to a local neighborhood. In addition. the parallel genetic algorithm executes an adaptation step after an individual is generated. with the genetic operators crossover and mutation. During the adaptation step the solution is improved by a common algorithm. Another selection step decides if the adapted descendant should replace the parent individual. Instead of using a uniform crossover operator a more intelligent crossover operator. which copies subsets of nodes. is used. Basic parameters of the parallel genetic algorithm are determined for different graphs.

Progress in both implementation and standardization is reaching a level of robustness that enables production quality deployments of grid services in the academic research community with heightened interest and early adoption in the industrial community. Despite this progress. grid applications are far from ubiquitous. and new applications require an enormous amount of programming effort just to see first light. A key impediment to accelerated deployment of grid applications is the scarcity of high-level application programming abstractions that bridge the gap between existing grid middleware and application-level needs. The Simple API for Grid Applications (SAGA [1]) is a GGF standardization effort that addresses this particular gap by providing a simple. stable. and uniform programming interface that integrates the most common grid programming abstractions. These most common abstractions were identified through the analysis of several existing and emerging Grid applications. In this article. we present the SAGA effort. describe its relationship to other Grid API efforts within the GGF community. and introduce the first draft of the API using some application programming examples.,True,jdHOOEYAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,140,https://www.academia.edu/download/40240373/01Goodale.pdf,5077095511612000429,/scholar?cites=5077095511612000429,,https://www.academia.edu/download/40240373/01Goodale.pdf,0,0,0

The framework can evaluate through specialized services simple contextual quality statements in order to effect the reputation for a monitored resource.

There is strong evidence to support that high temperatures of such data centers will lead to higher hardware failure rates and thus an increase in maintenance costs.

From our preliminary experience of five human liver allografts we feel that active collaboration between hospitals is essential in order to practise human liver transplantation. It is unnecessary and undesirable to interfere in any way with potential liver donors. Nevertheless. the nature of the surgical technique requires that the liver is cooled within 15 minutes of death if satisfactory function is to result in the grafted organ.This report describes technical difficulties that were encountered which can limit successful liver transplantation. The first patient was in severe liver failure and had an accessory liver graft in the splenic fossa after splenectomy.

Polyclonal antibodies to human CEA recognized the immunoaffinity-purified MHV receptor and the MHV receptor in liver membranes and intestinal brush border membranes from MHV-susceptible mouse strains. In membranes from MHV-resistant SJL/J mice. the anti-CEA antibodies recognized a homologous glycoprotein that failed to bind MHV.

We isolated a cDNA clone (MHVR1) encoding the MHV receptor. The sequence of this clone predicts a 424-amino-acid glycoprotein with four immunoglobulinlike domains. a transmembrane domain. and a short intracytoplasmic tail. MHVR1 is closely related to the murine CEA-related clone mmCGM1 (Mus musculus carcinoembryonic antigen gene family member). Western blot (immunoblot) analysis performed with antireceptor antibodies detected a glycoprotein of 120 kDa in BHK cells stably transfected with MHVR1.

Little has been said about encouraging people from Indigenous groups into the health and education discipline(s) to help provide a safe environment which includes cultural safety. This is a phrase originally coined by Maori nurses which means that there is no assault on a person's identity. The people most able or equipped to provide a culturally safe atmosphere are people from the same culture. We need to move on from the ‘short term. cost effective. quick fix’ approach to Indigenous issues. driven by economic imperatives. the clamouring of industry and conservative. hegemonic practices.

1102602,Optimizing bitmap indices with efficient compression,2006,Kesheng Wu and Ekow J Otoo and Arie Shoshani,31,ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS),1,1-38,ACM,Bitmap indices are efficient for answering queries on low-cardinality attributes. In this article. we present a new compression scheme called Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) code that makes compressed bitmap indices efficient even for high-cardinality attributes. We further prove that the new compressed bitmap index. like the best variants of the B-tree index. is optimal for one-dimensional range queries.

1102607,On the performance of bitmap indices for high cardinality attributes,2004,Kesheng Wu and Ekow Otoo and Arie Shoshani,,,,,,It is well established that bitmap indices are efficient for  read-only attributes with a small number of distinct values. For an attribute  with a large number of distinct values. the size of the bitmap index can be  very large. To over come this size problem. specialized compression schemes  are used. Even though there is empirical evidence that some of these  compression schemes work well. there has not been any systematic analysis of  their effectiveness. In this paper. we analyze the time and space complexities  of the two most efficient bitmap compression techniques known. the  Byte-aligned Bitmap Code (BBC) and the Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) code. and  study their performance on high cardinality attributes. Our analyses indicate  that both compression schemes are optimal in time. The time and space required  to operate on two compressed bitmaps are proportional to the total size of the  two bitmaps. We demonstrate further that an in-place OR algorithm can operate  on a large number of sparse bitmaps in time linear in their total size. Our  analyses also show that the compressed indices are relatively small compared  with commonly used indices such as B-trees. Given these facts. we conclude  that bitmap index is efficient on attributes of low cardinalities as well as  on those of high cardinalities. We also verify the analytical results with  extensive tests. and identify an optimal way to combine different options to  achieve the best performance. The test results confirm the linearity in the  total size of the compressed bitmaps. and that WAH out performs BBC by about a  factor of two.,True,Wn_XQUkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,232,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/54p843mq,11560045265553284857,/scholar?cites=11560045265553284857,,https://escholarship.org/content/qt54p843mq/qt54p843mq.pdf,0,0,0

The main operations on the bitmaps during query processing are bitwise logical operations. Using the general purpose compression schemes the logical operations on the compressed bitmaps are much slower than on the uncompressed bitmaps. Specialized compression schemes. like the byte-aligned bitmap code (BBC). are usually faster in performing logical operations than the general purpose schemes. but in many cases they are still orders of magnitude slower than the uncompressed scheme. To make the compressed bitmap indexes operate more efficiently. we designed a CPU-friendly scheme which we refer to as the word-aligned hybrid code (WAH).

To assign a label to a new object. most connected component labeling algorithms use a scanning step that examines some of its neighbors. The first strategy exploits the dependencies among them to reduce the number of neighbors examined. When considering 8-connected components in a 2D image. this can reduce the number of neighbors examined from four to one in many cases. The second strategy uses an array to store the equivalence information among the labels. This replaces the pointer based rooted trees used to store the same equivalence information. It reduces the memory required and also produces consecutive final labels. Using an array instead of the pointer based rooted trees speeds up the connected component labeling algorithms by a factor of 5 ~ 100 in our …,True,Wn_XQUkAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,177,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5747/0000/Optimizing-connected-component-labeling-algorithms/10.1117/12.596105.short,6232325898537565700,/scholar?cites=6232325898537565700,,https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/887435,0,0,0

A common way of exploring these datasets is to identify and track regions of interest. Usually these regions are defined as contiguous sets of points whose attributes satisfy some user defined conditions. e.g. high temperature regions in a combustion simulation. At each time step. the regions of interest may be identified by first searching for all points that satisfy the conditions and then grouping the points into connected regions. To speed up this process. the searching step may use a tree-based indexing scheme. such as a KD-tree or an Octree. However. these indices are efficient only if the searches are limited to one or a small number of selected attributes.

This problem is especially critical for scientific investigators who need ready access to the large volume of data generated by large-scale supercomputer simulations and physical experiments as well as the automated collection of observations by monitoring devices and satellites. This problem also negates the benefits of fast networks. because the time to access a subset from a large dataset stored on a mass storage system is much greater than the time to transmit that subset over a fast network. This paper focuses on very large spatial and temporal datasets generated by simulation of climate models. but the techniques described here are applicable to any large multidimensional grid data.

Many of these scientific datasets are arrays. and are stored in file formats such as HDF5 and NetCDF. Although scientific data management systems. such as SciDB. are designed to manipulate arrays. there are challenges in integrating these systems into existing analysis workflows. Major barriers include the expensive task of preparing and loading data before querying. and converting the final results to a format that is understood by the existing post-processing and visualization tools. As a consequence. integrating a data management system into an existing scientific data analysis workflow is time-consuming and requires extensive user involvement.

Today there are many workflow systems. often with overlapping functionality. A key issue for potential users of workflow systems is the need to be able to compare the capabilities of the various available tools. There can be confusion about system functionality and the tools are often selected without a proper functional analysis. In this paper we extract a taxonomy of features from the way scientists make use of existing workflow systems and we illustrate this feature set by providing some examples taken from existing workflow systems.

Heidelberg,Perhaps the most critical feature in the design of a shared memory parallel processor is the organization and the performance of the memory system. Generally. the shared memory is implemented as a set of independant modules which may be themselves interleaved and are connected to the processors via either a bus or a switch network. This organization exhibits several potential performance problems. First because of the long journey each memory reference must traverse in going to and from this shared resource the latency to access data may be very high. This effect can be very important especially in systems with a large number of processors connected to memory by a multistage network. In this case each globlal memory request must go through log2 (p) where p is number of processors.

One model is a generalization of an approach due to Hockney. and is suitable for shared memory multiprocessors where each processor has vector capabilities. The other model is applicable to highly parallel nonshared memory MIMD systems. In this second model. algorithm performance is characterized in terms of the communication network design.

The goal of this framework is to provide good resource allocation for Grid applications and to support adaptive reallocation if performance degrades because of changes in the availability of Grid resources. At the heart of this strategy is the notion of a configurable object program. which contains. in addition to application code. strategies for mapping the application to different collections of resources and a resource selection model that provides an estimate of the performance of the application on a specific collection of Grid resources. This model must be accurate enough to distinguish collections of resources that will deliver good performance from those that will not. The GrADS execution framework also provides a contract monitoring mechanism for interrupting and remapping an application execution when performance falls below acceptable levels.,True,atADlJgAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,174,http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~dangulo/papers/ngs-ipdps02.pdf,16061849702338922477,/scholar?cites=16061849702338922477,,http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~dangulo/papers/ngs-ipdps02.pdf,0,0,0

1102651,The impact of multicore on computational science software,2007,Jack Dongarra and Dennis Gannon and Geoffrey Fox and Ken Kennedy,3,CTWatch Quarterly,1,1-10,,The idea that computational modeling and simulation represents a new branch of scientific methodology. alongside theory and experimentation. was introduced about two decades ago. It has since come to symbolize the enthusiasm and sense of importance that people in our community feel for the work they are doing. But when we try to assess how much progress we have made and where things stand along the developmental path for this new “third pillar of science.” recalling some history about the development of the other pillars can help keep things in perspective. For example. we can trace the systematic use of experiment back to Galileo in the early seventeenth century. Yet for all the incredible successes it enjoyed over its first three centuries. the experimental method arguably did not fully mature until the elements of good experimental design and practice were finally analyzed and described in detail by RA Fisher and others in the first half of the twentieth century. In that light. it seems clear that while Computational Science has had many remarkable youthful successes. it is still at a very early stage in its growth.Many of us today who want to hasten that growth believe that the most progressive steps in that direction require much more community focus on the vital core of Computational Science: software and the mathematical models and algorithms it encodes. Of course the general and widespread obsession with hardware is understandable. especially given exponential increases in processor performance. the constant evolution of processor architectures and supercomputer designs. and the natural fascination that people have for big …,True,atADlJgAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,145,https://www.academia.edu/download/48780465/The_Impact_of_Multicore_on_Computational20160912-15777-1qqo240.pdf,4213953197211430694,/scholar?cites=4213953197211430694,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48780465/The_Impact_of_Multicore_on_Computational20160912-15777-1qqo240.pdf,0,0,0

1102664,A cost and speed model for k-ary n-cube wormhole routers,1993,Andrew A Chien,93,Proceedings of Hot Interconnects,,5-7,,A great deal of research has been published on the performance of wormhole routers with advanced features such as adaptivity and virtual lanes. In most cases. the e ectiveness of such novel routers is evaluated on the basis of the achieved network throughput (channel utilization). ignoring the important e ects of implementation complexity. In this paper we describe a parameterized cost model for router performance. characterized by two numbers: router delay and ow control time. Grounding the cost model in a 0.8 micron gate array technology. we use it to compare a number of proposed routing algorithms. Based on these design studies. several insights regarding the implementation complexity of adaptive routing are clear. First. header update and selection is expensive in adaptive routers. suggesting the absolute addressing should be reconsidered. Second. virtual channels are expensive in terms of latency and cycle time. so decisions to include them to support adaptivity or even virtual lanes should not be taken lightly. Third. requirements of larger crossbars and more complex arbitration cause some increase in the complexity of adaptive routers. but the rate of increase is small. Finally. the complexity of adaptive routers signi cantly increases their setup delay and ow control cycle times. implying that claims of performance advantages in channel utilization and low load latency must be carefully balanced against losses in achievable implementation speed.,True,zkqz0_0AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,254,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22.6577&rep=rep1&type=pdf,3154795452550031590,/scholar?cites=3154795452550031590,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.22.6577&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

Adaptive routing allows more freedom in the paths taken by messages. spreading load over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms. called planar-adaptive routing algorithms. that require only a constant number of virtual channels. independent of networks size and dimension. Planar-adaptive routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock prevention by reducing the number of choices at each routing step. In the fault-free case. planar-adaptive networks are guaranteed to be  deadlock-free. In the presence of network faults. the planar-adaptive router can be extended with misrouting to produce a working …,True,zkqz0_0AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,191,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/200836.200856,8723341793216064630,/scholar?cites=8723341793216064630,,,0,0,0

A new generation of efficient messaging layers is needed to take advantage of the hardware performance and to deliver it to the application level. Communication software is the key element in bridging the communication performance gap separating MPPs and workstation clusters. MPI-FM is a high performance implementation of Message Passing Interface (MPI) for networks of workstations connected with a Myrinet network. built on top of the Fast Messages (FM) library. Based on the FM version 1.1 released in Fall 1995. MPI-FM achieves a minimum one-way latency of 19 μs and a peak bandwidth of 17.3 Mbyte/s with common MPI send and receive function calls.

Efficient desktop grid execution of short-lived applications is an attractive proposition and we claim that it is achievable via intelligent resource selection. We propose three general techniques for resource selection: resource prioritization. resource exclusion. and task duplication. We use these techniques to instantiate several scheduling heuristics. We evaluate these heuristics through trace-driven simulations of four representative desktop grid configurations. We find that ranking desk-top resources according to their clock rates. without taking into account their availability history. is surprisingly effective in practice.

The goal of this framework is to provide good resource allocation for Grid applications and to support adaptive reallocation if performance degrades because of changes in the availability of Grid resources. At the heart of this strategy is the notion of a configurable object program. which contains. in addition to application code. strategies for mapping the application to different collections of resources and a resource selection model that provides an estimate of the performance of the application on a specific collection of Grid resources. This model must be accurate enough to distinguish collections of resources that will deliver good performance from those that will not.

However. the most common approach. gang scheduling. has limitations in scaling. can compromise good interactive response. and requires that communicating processes be identified in advance.We explore a technique called dynamic coscheduling (DCS) which produces emergent coscheduling of the processes constituting a parallel job. Experiments are performed in a workstation environment with high performance networks and autonomous timesharing schedulers for each CPU. The results demonstrate that DCS can achieve effective. robust coscheduling for a range of workloads and background loads.

The algorithm tries to achieve a good throughput of the whole data processing pipeline. taking both parallelism (load balance) and communication volume (locality) into account. It performs well both under computationally intensive and communication-intensive conditions. When all tasks/processors are of the same size and communication is negligible. it quickly distributes the computation load over the processors and finds the optimal mapping. As communication becomes significant and reveals a bottleneck. it trades parallelism for reduction of communication traffic.

Unfortunately. most concurrent object-oriented languages construct hierarchical abstractions from objects that serialize-serializing the abstractions. In machines with tens of thousands of processors. unnecessary serialization of this sort can cause significant loss of concurrency.Concurrent Aggregates (CA) is an object-oriented language that allows programmers to build unserialized hierarchies of abstractions by using aggregates.

It aims to accurately map the distribution of relative stopping power. Because protons traverse material media in non-linear paths. pCT requires individual proton processing. Image reconstruction then becomes a time-consuming process. Clinical-use scenarios that require images from billions of protons in less than ten or fifteen minutes have motivated us to use distributed and hardware-accelerated computing methods to achieve fast image reconstruction. Combined use of MPI and GPUs demonstrates that clinically viable image reconstruction is possible. On a 60-node CPU/GPU computer cluster. we achieved efficient strong and weak scaling when reconstructing images from two billion histories in under seven minutes.

Initial efforts produced"" optimal"" trees based on network communication models that assumed equal point-to-point latencies between any two processes. This assumption is violated in most practical settings. however. particularly in heterogeneous systems such as clusters of SMPs and wide-area"" computational Grids."" with the result that collective operations perform suboptimally. In response. more recent work has focused on creating topology-aware trees for collective operations that minimize communication across slower channels (eg. a wide-area network). While these efforts have significant communication benefits. they all limit their view of the network to only two layers. We present a strategy based upon a multilayer view of the network. By creating multilevel topology-aware trees we take advantage of communication cost differences at every level in the network. We used this strategy to implement topology-aware versions of several MPI collective operations in MPICH-G2. the Globus Toolkit [tm]-enabled version of the popular MPICH implementation of the MPI standard. Using information about topology provided by MPICH-G2. we construct these multilevel topology-aware trees automatically during execution.

It is shown that the X-ray contrast within a single exposure can be related to the relaxation time of the intermediate scattering function. and this methodology is applied to the diffusion of 72 nm-radius latex spheres in glycerol. Data were collected with exposure times as short as 2 ms by employing a resonant shutter. The weak scattering present for short exposures necessitated an analysis formalism based on the spatial correlation function of individual photon charge droplets on an area detector. rather than the usual methods employed for intensity correlations.

Such projects frequently ignore the question of whether individual resource owners are willing to share their personal resources for the overall good of the community. However. experiences [3-6] with peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems like Gnutella. Napster. and Kazaa suggest that users are not altruistic. In Gnutella. for example. 70% of all users do not share files. and 50% of all requests are satisfied by the top 1% sharing hosts. Thus. incentive mechanisms that motivate users to contribute resources may be critical to eventual success of such systems. Various approaches to incentives have been proposed. including pricing or micro-currency schemes [7] and so-called “soft incentive” or nonpricing schemes [8]. However. the effectiveness of these different schemes is not well understood. In this paper we take a step towards understanding the performance of incentive schemes by defining and applying an analytic model based on Schelling’s Multi-Person Prisoner’s Dilemma (MPD)[9]. We use both this framework and simulations to study the effectiveness of different schemes for encouraging sharing in distributed file sharing systems. We consider three such schemes: the soft-incentive. reputation-based Peer-Approved and Service-Quality. and the Token-Exchange pricing scheme.

First. as attackers have no control over victim accounts and cannot alter their activities. a victim account classifier which relies on user-level activities is relatively harder to circumvent.

In the past. nation states have exerted their control over Internet access to outright block connections to social media during times of political upheaval. Parties without such capabilities may however still desire to control political expression.

This article argues that a checkpoint storage system. optimized to operate in these environments. can offer multiple benefits: reduce the load on a traditional file system. offer high-performance through specialization. and. finally. optimize data management by taking into account checkpoint application semantics. Such a storage system can present a unifying abstraction to checkpoint operations. while hiding the fact that there are no dedicated resources to store the checkpoint data.

In this paper. we use smart parking as a case study to investigate features of crowdsourcing that may apply to other mobile applications.

We draw three key guidelines: First. we suggest that that the organizer can play an important role in coordinating participants'. a key factor to successful crowdsourcing experience. Second. we suggest that the expected participation rate is a key factor when designing the crowdsourcing system: a system with a lower expected participation rate will place a higher burden in individual participants (eg. through more complex interfaces that aim to improve the accuracy of the collected data).

The increasing large scale and wealth of connected data. such as those accrued by social network applications. demand the design of new techniques and platforms to efficiently derive actionable information from large scale graphs. Hybrid systems that host processing units optimized for both fast sequential processing and bulk processing (e.g..

Reaching this point. however. poses multiple challenges. The heterogeneity of the processing elements (e.g..

1102771,Home ventilation,2003,AK Simonds,22,,47 suppl,38s-46s,European Respiratory Society,Home ventilation is a growth area. Rapid expansion during the 1990s was stimulated by the development of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) via a mask and the recognition that an increased number of patient groups can benefit. Although patients receiving NIV in the home outnumber those receiving invasive ventilation via tracheostomy. there is substantial variation in practice between European countries.Evidence that individuals who develop ventilatory failure as a consequence of chest wall disease or stable neuromuscular disease such as old poliomyelitis benefit from nocturnal NIV is overwhelming. Patients with progressive neuromuscular disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can also derive prolongation of life. palliation of symptoms and an improvement in quality of life.Home ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients remains controversial …,True,haNX60sAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,196,https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/22/47_suppl/38s.short,11291056536368236355,/scholar?cites=11291056536368236355,,https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/22/47_suppl/38s.full.pdf,0,0,0

Meetings are organized by the ESC and EACTS and directed towards their member National Societies and key opinion-leaders in Europe. Implementation meetings can also be undertaken at national levels. once the guidelines have been endorsed by the ESC and EACTS member societies and translated into the national language.

CONSENSUS Trial Study Group.,1990,Karl Swedberg and Peter Eneroth and John Kjekshus and Lars Wilhelmsen,82,Circulation,5,1730-1736,,There is a varying hormonal activation in heart failure. To be able to evaluate this activation and relate it to prognosis. we took blood samples at baseline and after 6 weeks from 239 patients with severe heart failure (all in New York Heart Association class IV) randomized to additional treatment with enalapril or placebo. In this study (CONSENSUS). which has previously been reported. there was a significant reduction in mortality among patients treated with enalapril. The present data show in the placebo group a significant positive relation between mortality and levels of angiotensin II (p less than 0.05). aldosterone (p = 0.003). noradrenaline (p less than 0.001). adrenaline (p = 0.001). and atrial natriuretic factor (p = 0.003).

Cohort studies of hospitalized patients show a smaller proportion of HF-PSF. Compared to those with reduced systolic function. patients with HF-PSF are more often female. older. less likely to have coronary artery disease. and more likely to have hypertension. Patients with HF-PSF are less symptomatic and receive different pharmacologic therapy than patients with reduced systolic function. Morbidity and mortality rates in patients with HF-PSF are high but not quite as high as in patients with reduced systolic function.

All stages of CKD are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity. premature mortality. and/or decreased quality of life. CKD is usually asymptomatic until later stages and accurate prevalence data are lacking. Thus we sought to determine the prevalence of CKD globally. by stage. geographical location. gender and age. A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies estimating CKD prevalence in general populations was conducted through literature searches in 8 databases. We assessed pooled data using a random effects model. Of 5.842 potential articles. 100 studies of diverse quality were included. comprising 6.908.440 patients. Global mean(95%CI) CKD prevalence of 5 stages 13·4%(11·7–15·1%). and stages 3–5 was 10·6%(9·2–12·2%). Weighting by study quality did not affect prevalence estimates. CKD prevalence by stage was Stage-1 (eGFR>90+ACR>30): 3·5% (2·8–4·2%); Stage-2 (eGFR 60–89+ACR>30): 3·9% (2·7–5·3%); Stage-3 (eGFR 30–59): 7·6% (6·4–8·9%); Stage-4 = (eGFR 29–15): 0·4% (0·3–0·5%); and Stage-5 (eGFR<15): 0·1% (0·1–0·1%). CKD has a high global prevalence with a consistent estimated global CKD prevalence of between 11 to 13% with the majority stage 3.

Several new therapies showed good results in small-scale trials. but these have not been repeated in larger trials with long-term follow-up. This article reports a qualitative overview of the available clinical literature by an international panel of experts using standard methods of appraisal. The article provides evidence-based recommendations on prevention and treatment of abnormal scarring and. where studies are insufficient. consensus on best practice. The recommendations focus on the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids. and are internationally applicable in a range of clinical situations. These recommendations support a move to a more evidence-based approach in scar management. This approach highlights a primary role for silicone gel sheeting and intralesional corticosteroids in the management of a wide variety of abnormal scars. The authors concluded that these are the only treatments for which sufficient evidence exists to make evidence-based recommendations. A number of other therapies that are in common use have achieved acceptance by the authors as standard practice. However. it is highly desirable that many standard practices and new emerging therapies undergo large-scale studies with long-term follow-up before being recommended conclusively as alternative therapies for scar management.,True,k13_7rUAAAAJ:WC9gN4BGCRcC,1261,https://europepmc.org/article/med/12142678,4655886760014828407,/scholar?cites=4655886760014828407,,,0,0,0

Recent studies suggest epithelial cells are an important source of myofibroblasts through a process described as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; however. confirmatory studies in vivo are lacking.

Infection is often associated with bacterial dissemination to distant sites. and there are many possible disease manifestations. with melioidosis septic shock being the most severe. Eradication of the organism following infection is difficult. with a slow fever-clearance time. the need for prolonged antibiotic therapy and a high rate of relapse if therapy is not completed. Mortality from melioidosis septic shock remains high despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Prevention of disease and a reduction in mortality and the rate of relapse are priority areas for future research efforts.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1384,739-749,The Royal Society,Antimarial drug resistance develops when spontaneously occurring parasite mutants with reduced susceptibility are selected. and are then transmitted. Drugs for which a single point mutation confers a marked reduction in susceptibility are particularly vulnerable. Low clearance and a shallow concentration–effect relationship increase the chance of selection. Use of combinations of antimalarials that do not share the same resistance mechanisms will reduce the chance of selection because the chance of a resistant mutant surviving is the product of the per parasite mutation rates for the individual drugs. multiplied by the number of parasites in an infection that are exposed to the drugs. Artemisinin derivatives are particularly effective combination partners because (i) they are very active antimalarials. producing up to 10 000–fold reductions in parasite biomass per asexual cycle; (ii) they reduce malaria transmissibility …,True,nEBI9MgAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,590,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.1999.0426,7339920846795240691,/scholar?cites=7339920846795240691,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1692562/pdf/10365399.pdf,0,0,0

The peripheral blood parasite count measures only the circulating. relatively non-pathogenic parasite numbers. P. falciparum releases a specific histidine-rich protein (PfHRP2) into plasma. Quantitative measurement of plasma PfHRP2 concentrations may reflect the total parasite biomass in falciparum malaria.   Methods and Findings We measured plasma concentrations of PfHRP2. using a quantitative antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in 337 adult patients with falciparum malaria of varying severity hospitalised on the Thai–Burmese border. Based on in vitro production rates. we constructed a model to link this measure to the total parasite burden in the patient.

We analyzed the in vivo transcriptomes of 1043 P. falciparum isolates from patients with acute malaria and found that artemisinin resistance is associated with increased expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways involving the major PROSC and TRiC chaperone complexes. Artemisinin-resistant parasites also exhibit decelerated progression through the first part of the asexual intraerythrocytic development cycle.

Here. we compare the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of two real-time PCR assays targeting rrs or lipL32 for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in northeast Thailand.   Methods/Principal Findings A case-control study of 266 patients (133 cases of leptospirosis and 133 controls) was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (DSe & DSp) of both PCR assays. The median duration of illness prior to admission of cases was 4 days (IQR 2–5 days; range 1–12 days). DSe and DSp were determined using positive culture and/or microscopic agglutination test (MAT) as the gold standard. The DSe was higher for the rrs assay than the lipL32 assay (56%. (95% CI 47–64%) versus 43%. (95% CI 34–52%). p<0.001). No cases were positive for the lipL32 assay alone. There was borderline evidence to suggest that the DSp of the rrs assay was lower than the lipL32 assay (90% (95% CI 83–94%) versus 93%. (95%CI 88–97%). p = 0.06).

Here. we discuss target populations for vaccination. consider the cost-benefit of different vaccination strategies and review potential vaccine candidates.   Methods and Findings Melioidosis is highly endemic in Thailand and northern Australia. where a biodefense vaccine might be adopted for public health purposes. A cost-effectiveness analysis model was developed. which showed that a vaccine could be a cost-effective intervention in Thailand. particularly if used in high-risk populations such as diabetics. Cost-effectiveness was observed in a model in which only partial immunity was assumed. The review systematically summarized all melioidosis vaccine candidates and studies in animal models that had evaluated their protectiveness. Possible candidates included live attenuated. whole cell killed. sub-unit. plasmid DNA and dendritic cell vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines were not considered favorably because of possible reversion to virulence and hypothetical risk of latent infection. while the other candidates need further development and evaluation. Melioidosis is acquired by skin inoculation. inhalation and ingestion. but routes of animal inoculation in most published studies to date do not reflect all of this. We found a lack of studies using diabetic models. which will be central to any evaluation of a melioidosis vaccine for natural …,True,qCalGWoAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,107,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001488,10987170017619396934,/scholar?cites=10987170017619396934,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001488,0,0,0

Defining the global pattern of B. pseudomallei distribution underpins efforts to prevent infection. and is dependent upon robust environmental sampling methodology. Our objective was to review the literature on the detection of environmental B. pseudomallei. update the risk map for melioidosis. and propose international consensus guidelines for soil sampling.   Methods/Principal Findings An international working party (Detection of Environmental Burkholderia pseudomallei Working Party (DEBWorP)) was formed during the VIth World Melioidosis Congress in 2010. PubMed (January 1912 to December 2011) was searched using the following MeSH terms: pseudomallei or melioidosis. Bibliographies were hand-searched for secondary references. The reported geographical distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment was mapped and categorized as definite. probable. or possible. The methodology used for detecting environmental B. pseudomallei was extracted and collated. We found that global coverage was patchy. with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable. and not all were robust.

Dimorphism in defined genes has led to P. ovale parasites being divided into classic and variant types. We hypothesized that these dimorphs represent distinct parasite species.  Methods . Multilocus sequence analysis of 6 genetic characters was carried out among 55 isolates from 12 African and 3 Asia-Pacific countries.  Results . Each genetic character displayed complete dimorphism and segregated perfectly between the 2 types. Both types were identified in samples from Ghana. Nigeria. São Tomé. Sierra Leone. and Uganda and have been described previously in Myanmar.

We reviewed the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of mefloquine and artesunate regimen (MAS3). over a 13 year period of continuous deployment as first-line treatment in camps for displaced persons and in clinics for migrant population along the Thai-Myanmar border.  Methods and Findings 3.264 patients were enrolled in prospective treatment trials between 1995 and 2007 and treated with MAS3. The proportion of patients with parasitaemia persisting on day-2 increased significantly from 4.5% before 2001 to 21.9% since 2002 (p<0.001). Delayed parasite clearance was associated with increased risk of developing gametocytaemia (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI. 2.00–2.69. p = 0.002).

Inoculation of the organism at a cutaneous mite bite site commonly results in formation of a localized pathological skin reaction termed an eschar. The site of development of the obligate intracellular bacteria within the eschar and the mechanisms of dissemination to cause systemic infection are unclear. Previous postmortem and in vitro reports demonstrated infection of endothelial cells. but recent pathophysiological investigations of typhus patients using surrogate markers of endothelial cell and leucocyte activation indicated a more prevalent host leucocyte than endothelial cell response in vivo. We therefore examined eschar skin biopsies from patients with scrub typhus to determine and characterize the phenotypes of host cells in vivo with intracellular infection by O. tsutsugamushi. using histology. immunohistochemistry. double immunofluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping of host leucocytes infected with O. tsutsugamushi showed a tropism for host monocytes and dendritic cells. which were spatially related to different histological zones of the eschar.

The main objectives of the study were to investigate the possible routes of transmission of the disease and the impact of FMD on the predominantly smallholder rice/livestock production system of Savannakhet Province. The study was performed by group interviews of farmers in ten villages. located in five districts across the width of the Province. and of district and provincial veterinary officials.Results suggested that the infection had probably been introduced from the eastern border and had spread rapidly west. along a principal trading route of pigs. cattle and buffalo.

MAPK8. and IL10RA to affect peak anti-HBs level (GMTratio of <0.6 or >1.5 and P≤0.001) and lesser associations in other genes. Odds of core-conversion was associated with variation in CD163. A coding change in ITGAL (R719V) with likely functional relevance showed evidence of association with increased peak anti-HBs level in both screens (1st screen: s595_22 GMTratio 1.71. P = 0.013; 2nd screen: s595_22 GMTratio 2.15. P = 0.011).ConclusionThis is to our knowledge the largest study to date assessing genetic determinants of HBV vaccine-induced immunity. We report on associations with anti-HBs level. which is directly related to durability of antibody level and predictive of vaccine efficacy long-term. A coding change in ITGAL. which plays a central role in immune cell interaction. was shown to exert beneficial effects on induction of peak antibody level in …,True,BrkIufYAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,99,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001898,15952987732590071493,/scholar?cites=15952987732590071493,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001898,0,0,0

Limited access to health care and the disease’s non-specific symptoms mean that many patients are undiagnosed and untreated. but the mortality from untreated scrub typhus is unknown. This review systematically summarizes the literature on the untreated mortality from scrub typhus and disease outcomes.   Methodology/Principal Findings A literature search was performed to identify patient series containing untreated patients. Patients were included if they were symptomatic and had a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of scrub typhus and excluded if they were treated with antibiotics. The primary outcome was mortality from untreated scrub typhus and secondary outcomes were total days of fever. clinical symptoms. and laboratory results. A total of 76 studies containing 89 patient series and 19.644 patients were included in the final analysis. The median mortality of all patient series was 6.0% with a wide range (min-max) of 0–70%.

Inoculation of the organism at a cutaneous mite bite site commonly results in formation of a localized pathological skin reaction termed an eschar. The site of development of the obligate intracellular bacteria within the eschar and the mechanisms of dissemination to cause systemic infection are unclear. Previous postmortem and in vitro reports demonstrated infection of endothelial cells. but recent pathophysiological investigations of typhus patients using surrogate markers of endothelial cell and leucocyte activation indicated a more prevalent host leucocyte than endothelial cell response in vivo.

Principal Findings Febrile episodes (n = 438) occurred in 5.0% (409/8.117) of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics from 7-Jan-2004 to 17-May-2006. The main cause was malaria in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6% of 409) women had detailed fever investigations and follow up. Arthropod-borne (malaria. rickettsial infections. and dengue) and zoonotic disease (leptospirosis) accounted for nearly half of all febrile illnesses. 47.3% (96/203). Coinfection was observed in 3.9% (8/203) of women. mostly malaria and rickettsia. Pyelonephritis. 19.7% (40/203). was also a common cause of fever. Once malaria. pyelonephritis and acute respiratory illness are excluded by microscopy and/or clinical findings. one-third of the remaining febrile infections will be caused by rickettsia or leptospirosis.

Initiatives to eliminate malaria are critically dependent on its efficacy. There is recent worrying evidence that artemisinin resistance has arisen on the Thai-Cambodian border. Urgent containment interventions are planned and about to be executed. Mathematical modeling approaches to intervention design are now integrated into the field of malaria epidemiology and control. The use of such an approach to investigate the likely effectiveness of different containment measures with the ultimate aim of eliminating artemisinin-resistant malaria is described. A population dynamic mathematical modeling framework was developed to explore the relative effectiveness of a variety of containment interventions in eliminating artemisinin-resistant malaria in western Cambodia. The most effective intervention to eliminate artemisinin-resistant malaria was a switch of treatment from artemisinin monotherapy to ACT (mean time to elimination 3.42 years (95% CI 3.32–3.60 years). However. with this approach it is predicted that elimination of artemisinin-resistant malaria using ACT can be achieved only by elimination of all malaria. This is because the various forms of ACT are more effective against infections with artemisinin-sensitive parasites. leaving the more resistant infections as an increasing proportion of the dwindling parasite population.

This process will take the form of a series of national eliminations. Key issues must be considered specifically for elimination strategy when compared to the control of disease. Namely the spread of drug resistance. data scarcity and the adverse effects of failed elimination attempts. Mathematical models of various levels of complexity have been produced to consider the control and elimination of malaria infection. If available. detailed data on malaria transmission (such as the vector life cycle and behaviour. human population behaviour. the acquisition and decay of immunity. heterogeneities in transmission intensity. age profiles of clinical and subclinical infection) can be used to populate complex transmission models that can then be used to design control strategy. However. in many malaria countries reliable data are not available and policy must be formed based on information like an estimate of the average parasite prevalence. A simple deterministic model. that requires data in the form of a single estimate of parasite prevalence as an input. is developed for the purpose of comparison with other more complex models. The model is designed to include key aspects of malaria transmission and integrated control. The simple model is shown to have similar short-term dynamic behaviour to three complex models. The model is used to demonstrate the potential of alternative methods of delivery of controls.

A recent field study in an area of low seasonal transmission in South West Cambodia demonstrated dramatic reductions in malaria parasite prevalence following both mass drug administration (MDA) and high treatment coverage of symptomatic patients with artemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine. This study employed multiple combined strategies and it was unclear what contribution each made to the reductions in malaria.   Method and Findings A mathematical model fitted to the trial results was used to assess the effects of the various components of these interventions. design optimal elimination strategies. and explore their interactions with artemisinin resistance. which has recently been discovered in Western Cambodia. The modelling indicated that most of the initial reduction of P. falciparum malaria resulted from MDA with artemisinin-piperaquine. The subsequent continued decline and near elimination resulted mainly from high coverage with artemisinin-piperaquine treatment. Both these strategies were more effective with the addition of primaquine. MDA with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) increased the proportion of artemisinin resistant infections. although much less than treatment of symptomatic cases with ACT. and this increase was slowed by adding primaquine. Artemisinin resistance reduced the effectiveness of interventions using ACT when the prevalence of resistance was very high.

ONSD varies with age and there is no clear consensus between studies for an upper limit of normal. Knowledge of normal ONSD in a healthy population is essential to interpret this measurement.  Methods In a prospective observational study. ONSD was measured using a 15 MHz ultrasound probe in healthy volunteers in Chittagong. Bangladesh. The aims were to determine the normal range of ONSD in healthy Bangladeshi adults and children. compare measurements in males and females. horizontal and vertical beam orientations and left and right eyes in the same individual and to determine whether ONSD varies with head circumference independent of age.  Results 136 subjects were enrolled. 12.5% of whom were age 16 or under. Median ONSD was 4.41 mm with 95% of subjects in the range 4.25–4.75 mm. ONSD was bimodally distributed. There was no relationship between ONSD and age (≥4 years). gender. head circumference. and no difference in left vs right eye or horizontal vs vertical beam.  Conclusions Ultrasonographic ONSD in Bangladeshi healthy volunteers has a narrow bimodal distribution independent of age (≥4 years). gender and head circumference.

Initiatives to eliminate malaria are critically dependent on its efficacy. There is recent worrying evidence that artemisinin resistance has arisen on the Thai-Cambodian border. Urgent containment interventions are planned and about to be executed. Mathematical modeling approaches to intervention design are now integrated into the field of malaria epidemiology and control. The use of such an approach to investigate the likely effectiveness of different containment measures with the ultimate aim of eliminating artemisinin-resistant malaria is described. A population dynamic mathematical modeling framework was developed to explore the relative effectiveness of a variety of containment interventions in eliminating artemisinin-resistant malaria in western Cambodia. The most effective intervention to eliminate artemisinin-resistant malaria was a switch of treatment from artemisinin monotherapy to ACT (mean time to elimination 3.42 years (95% CI 3.32–3.60 years). However. with this approach it is predicted that elimination of artemisinin-resistant malaria using ACT can be achieved only by elimination of all malaria. This is because the various forms of ACT are more effective against infections with artemisinin-sensitive parasites. leaving the more resistant infections as an increasing proportion of the dwindling parasite population.

Resistance is characterized by prolonged in vivo parasite clearance times (PCTs) following artesunate treatment. The biological basis is unclear. The hypothesis that delayed parasite clearance results from a stage-specific reduction in artemisinin sensitivity of the circulating young asexual parasite ring stages was examined. A mathematical model was developed. describing the intrahost parasite stage-specific pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relationships. Model parameters were estimated using detailed pharmacokinetic and parasite clearance data from 39 patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria treated with artesunate from Pailin (western Cambodia) where artemisinin resistance was evident and 40 patients from Wang Pha (northwestern Thailand) where efficacy was preserved.

Specificity of culture is 100% if the pathogenic organism is not found in healthy subjects. but the sensitivity of culture is more difficult to determine and may be low. Here. we apply Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) to data from patients with a single Gram-negative bacterial infection and define the true sensitivity of culture together with the impact of misclassification by culture on the reported accuracy of alternative diagnostic tests.  Methods/Principal Findings Data from published studies describing the application of five diagnostic tests (culture and four serological tests) to a patient cohort with suspected melioidosis were re-analysed using several Bayesian LCMs. Sensitivities. specificities. and positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs) were calculated. Of 320 patients with suspected melioidosis. 119 (37%) had culture confirmed melioidosis. Using the final model (Bayesian LCM with conditional dependence between serological tests). the sensitivity of culture was estimated to be 60.2%. Prediction accuracy of the final model was assessed using a classification tool to grade patients according to the likelihood of melioidosis. which indicated that an estimated disease prevalence of 61.6% was credible.

Research funding for vaccine development has largely considered protection within the biothreat context. but the resulting vaccines could be applicable to populations who are at risk of naturally acquired melioidosis. Here. we discuss target populations for vaccination. consider the cost-benefit of different vaccination strategies and review potential vaccine candidates.   Methods and Findings Melioidosis is highly endemic in Thailand and northern Australia. where a biodefense vaccine might be adopted for public health purposes. A cost-effectiveness analysis model was developed. which showed that a vaccine could be a cost-effective intervention in Thailand. particularly if used in high-risk populations such as diabetics. Cost-effectiveness was observed in a model in which only partial immunity was assumed. The review systematically summarized all melioidosis vaccine candidates and studies in animal models that had evaluated their protectiveness. Possible candidates included live attenuated. whole cell killed. sub-unit. plasmid DNA and dendritic cell vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines were not considered favorably because of possible reversion to virulence and hypothetical risk of latent infection. while the other candidates need further development and evaluation. Melioidosis is acquired by skin inoculation. inhalation and ingestion. but routes of animal inoculation in most published studies to date do not reflect all of this.

While the molecular basis of protection against clinical malaria remains unresolved. its effects on epidemiological patterns are well recognized. Accumulating epidemiological data constitute a valuable resource that must be intensively explored and interpreted as to effectively inform control planning.Methodology/Principal FindingHere we apply a mathematical model to clinical data from eight endemic regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The model provides a quantitative framework within which differences in age distribution of clinical disease are assessed in terms of the parameters underlying transmission. The shorter infectious periods estimated for clinical infections induce a regime of bistability of endemic and malaria-free states in regions of mesoendemic transmission. The two epidemiological states are separated by a threshold that provides a convenient measure for intervention design. Scenarios of eradication and resurgence are simulated.Conclusions/SignificanceIn regions that support mesoendemic transmission. intervention success depends critically on reducing prevalence below a threshold which separates endemic and malaria-free regimes.,True,k2rqfE8AAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,106,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001767,6695116441455800033,/scholar?cites=6695116441455800033,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001767,0,0,0

Artemisinin resistance was first detected in western Cambodia in 2007. and is now confirmed in the Greater Mekong region. raising the spectre of a malaria resurgence that could undo a decade of progress in control. and threaten the feasibility of elimination. The magnitude of this threat has not been quantified. This analysis compares the health and economic consequences of two future scenarios occurring once artemisinin-based treatments are available with high coverage. In the first scenario. artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is largely effective in the management of uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria is treated with artesunate. while in the second scenario ACT are failing at a rate of 30%. and treatment of severe malaria reverts to quinine. The model is applied to all malaria-endemic countries using their specific estimates for malaria incidence. transmission intensity and GDP. The model describes the direct medical costs for repeated diagnosis and retreatment of clinical failures as well as admission costs for severe malaria. For productivity losses. the conservative friction costing method is used. which assumes a limited economic impact for individuals that are no longer economically active until they are replaced from the unemployment pool. Using conservative assumptions and parameter estimates. the model projects an excess of 116.000 deaths annually in the scenario of widespread artemisinin resistance.

1103138,The role of simple mathematical models in malaria elimination strategy design,2009,Lisa J White and Richard J Maude and Wirichada Pongtavornpinyo and Sompob Saralamba and Ricardo Aguas and Thierry Van Effelterre and Nicholas PJ Day and Nicholas J White,8,Malaria Journal,1,212,BioMed Central,Malaria has recently been identified as a candidate for global eradication. This process will take the form of a series of national eliminations. Key issues must be considered specifically for elimination strategy when compared to the control of disease. Namely the spread of drug resistance. data scarcity and the adverse effects of failed elimination attempts. Mathematical models of various levels of complexity have been produced to consider the control and elimination of malaria infection. If available. detailed data on malaria transmission (such as the vector life cycle and behaviour. human population behaviour. the acquisition and decay of immunity. heterogeneities in transmission intensity. age profiles of clinical and subclinical infection) can be used to populate complex transmission models that can then be used to design control strategy. However. in many malaria countries reliable data are not available and policy must be formed based on information like an estimate of the average parasite prevalence. A simple deterministic model. that requires data in the form of a single estimate of parasite prevalence as an input. is developed for the purpose of comparison with other more complex models. The model is designed to include key aspects of malaria transmission and integrated control. The simple model is shown to have similar short-term dynamic behaviour to three complex models. The model is used to demonstrate the potential of alternative methods of delivery of controls. The adverse effects on clinical infection and spread of resistance are predicted for failed elimination attempts.

A recent field study in an area of low seasonal transmission in South West Cambodia demonstrated dramatic reductions in malaria parasite prevalence following both mass drug administration (MDA) and high treatment coverage of symptomatic patients with artemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine. This study employed multiple combined strategies and it was unclear what contribution each made to the reductions in malaria.   Method and Findings A mathematical model fitted to the trial results was used to assess the effects of the various components of these interventions. design optimal elimination strategies. and explore their interactions with artemisinin resistance. which has recently been discovered in Western Cambodia. The modelling indicated that most of the initial reduction of P. falciparum malaria resulted from MDA with artemisinin-piperaquine. The subsequent continued decline and near elimination resulted mainly from high coverage with artemisinin-piperaquine treatment. Both these strategies were more effective with the addition of primaquine. MDA with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) increased the proportion of artemisinin resistant infections. although much less than treatment of symptomatic cases with ACT. and this increase was slowed by adding primaquine. Artemisinin resistance reduced the effectiveness of interventions using ACT when the prevalence of resistance was very high.

Because antibiotic-non-susceptible 19A has increased more than antibiotic-susceptible 19A. antibiotic selection pressure could be contributing to this trend. We developed a dynamic compartmental transmission model of pneumococcus to better understand the causes of this rise and to estimate the impact of vaccines or changes in antibiotic use on future IPD incidence in the U.S. in <2 year-olds. The model predicted that with current practices. serotype 19A IPD incidence will plateau at about the 2007 level over the next few years.

Adhesion of parasitized red blood cells in the brain microvasculature is mediated by specific receptors on the host endothelium. including intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. CD36 and CD31. Leucocyte binding to cerebral endothelial cells in culture induces intracellular signalling via ICAM-1. The hypothesis that parasitized red blood cells binding to receptors on cerebral endothelial cells causes changes in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier was tested. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the blood-brain barrier in human cerebral malaria. with antibodies to macrophage and endothelial activation markers. intercellular junction proteins. and plasma proteins. The distribution of the cell junction proteins occludin. vinculin and ZO-1 were altered in cerebral malaria cases compared to controls. While fibrinogen was the only plasma protein detected in the perivascular space. there was widespread perivascular macrophage activation. suggesting that these cells had been exposed to plasma proteins.

Polymorphisms in the kelch domain–carrying protein K13 are associated with artemisinin resistance. but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We analyzed the in vivo transcriptomes of 1043 P. falciparum isolates from patients with acute malaria and found that artemisinin resistance is associated with increased expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways involving the major PROSC and TRiC chaperone complexes. Artemisinin-resistant parasites also exhibit decelerated progression through the first part of the asexual intraerythrocytic development cycle. These findings suggest that artemisinin-resistant parasites remain in a state of decelerated development at the young ring stage. whereas their up-regulated UPR pathways mitigate protein damage caused by artemisinin.

Comparator drugs were mefloquine-artesunate (MAS3) in Thailand. Myanmar. Laos and Cambodia; artemether-lumefantrine in Uganda; and amodiaquine+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and artesunate+amodiaquine in Rwanda.  Methods and Findings In total 3.547 patients were enrolled: 1.814 patients (32% children under five years) received DP and 1.733 received a comparator antimalarial at 12 different sites and were followed for 28–63 days. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials. DP was well tolerated with 1.7% early vomiting.

The nature of Shigellae suggests that they are highly adaptable when placed under selective pressure in a human population. This is demonstrated by variation and fluctuations in serotypes and antimicrobial resistance profile of organisms circulating in differing setting in endemic locations. Antimicrobial resistance in the genus Shigella is a constant threat. with reports of organisms in Asia being resistant to multiple antimicrobials and new generation therapies. Here we compare microbiological. clinical and epidemiological data from patients with shigellosis over three different periods in southern Vietnam spanning14 years. Our data demonstrates a shift in dominant infecting species (S. flexneri to S. sonnei) and resistance profile of the organisms circulating in southern Vietnam. We find that there was no significant variation in the syndromes associated with either S. sonnei or S. flexneri. yet the clinical features of the disease are more severe in later observations. Our findings show a change in clinical presentation of shigellosis in this setting. as the disease may be now more pronounced. this is concurrent with a change in antimicrobial resistance profile.

We reviewed the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of mefloquine and artesunate regimen (MAS3). over a 13 year period of continuous deployment as first-line treatment in camps for displaced persons and in clinics for migrant population along the Thai-Myanmar border.  Methods and Findings 3.264 patients were enrolled in prospective treatment trials between 1995 and 2007 and treated with MAS3. The proportion of patients with parasitaemia persisting on day-2 increased significantly from 4.5% before 2001 to 21.9% since 2002 (p<0.001). Delayed parasite clearance was associated with increased risk of developing gametocytaemia (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI. 2.00–2.69. p = 0.002). Gametocytaemia on admission and carriage also increased over the years (p = 0.001. test for trend. for both). MAS3 efficacy has declined slightly but significantly (Hazards ratio 1.13; 95% CI. 1.07–1.19. p<0.001). although efficacy in 2007 remained well within acceptable limits: 96.5% (95% CI. 91.0–98.7). The in vitro susceptibility of P. falciparum to artesunate increased significantly until 2002. but thereafter declined to levels close to those of 13 years ago (geometric mean in 2007: 4.2 nM/l; 95% CI. 3.2–5.5). The proportion of infections caused by parasites with increased pfmdr1 copy number rose from 30% (12/40) in 1996 to 53% (24/45) in 2006 (p = 0.012. test for trend).

METHODS: We did an open-label randomised controlled trial in patients admitted to hospital with severe falciparum malaria in Bangladesh. India. Indonesia. and Myanmar. We assigned individuals intravenous artesunate 2.4 mg/kg bodyweight given as a bolus (n= 730) at 0. 12. and 24 h. and then daily. or intravenous quinine (20 mg salt per kg loading dose infused over 4 h then 10 mg/kg infused over 2-8 h three times a day; n= 731).

We hypothesized that some strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) are more capable of causing disseminated disease than others and may be associated with polymorphisms in host genes responsible for the innate immune response to infection. We compared the host and bacterial genotype in 187 Vietnamese adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and 237 Vietnamese adults with uncomplicated pulmonary tuberculosis. The host genotype of tuberculosis cases was also compared with the genotype of 392 cord blood controls from the same population. Isolates of M. tuberculosis were genotyped by large sequence polymorphisms. The hosts were defined by polymorphisms in genes encoding Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) and Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2). We found a significant protective association between the Euro-American lineage of M. tuberculosis and pulmonary rather than meningeal tuberculosis (Odds ratio (OR) for causing TBM 0.395. 95% confidence intervals (C.I.) 0.193–0.806.

Unless the rise in antibiotic resistance can be reversed. we can expect to see a substantial rise in incurable infection and fatality in both developed and developing regions.

MLST uses the same principles as multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and provides data that can be used to investigate aspects of the population genetics and evolution of bacterial species. We used an MLST data set consisting of the sequences of approximately 450-bp fragments from seven housekeeping loci from a large strain collection of Neisseria meningitidis to estimate the relative impact of recombination compared with point mutation in the diversification of N. meningitidis clonal complexes. 126 meningococcal isolates were assigned to 10 clonal complexes. 9 of which contained minor clonal variants.

This technique has been applied to 575 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and identifies a number of discrete clonal complexes. These clonal complexes are typically represented by a single group of isolates sharing identical alleles at all seven loci. plus single-locus variants that differ from this group at only one out of the seven loci. As MLST is highly discriminatory. the members of each clonal complex can be assumed to have a recent common ancestor. and the molecular events that give rise to the single-locus variants can be used to estimate the relative contributions of recombination and mutation to clonal divergence.

Specificity of culture is 100% if the pathogenic organism is not found in healthy subjects. but the sensitivity of culture is more difficult to determine and may be low. Here. we apply Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) to data from patients with a single Gram-negative bacterial infection and define the true sensitivity of culture together with the impact of misclassification by culture on the reported accuracy of alternative diagnostic tests.  Methods/Principal Findings Data from published studies describing the application of five diagnostic tests (culture and four serological tests) to a patient cohort with suspected melioidosis were re-analysed using several Bayesian LCMs. Sensitivities. specificities. and positive and negative predictive values (PPVs and NPVs) were calculated. Of 320 patients with suspected melioidosis. 119 (37%) had culture confirmed melioidosis. Using the final model (Bayesian LCM with conditional dependence between serological tests). the sensitivity of culture was estimated to be 60.2%. Prediction accuracy of the final model was assessed using a classification tool to grade patients according to the likelihood of melioidosis. which indicated that an estimated disease prevalence of 61.6% was credible.

In both fields. a key prerequisite for exploiting this resource is the ability to discern the relatedness and patterns of evolutionary descent among isolates with similar genotypes. Traditional clustering techniques. such as dendrograms. provide a very poor representation of recent evolutionary events. as they attempt to reconstruct relationships in the absence of a realistic model of the way in which bacterial clones emerge and diversify to form clonal complexes.

Recently penicillin-resistant serotype 23F S. pneumoniae strains were also isolated from children attending a day-care center in Cleveland. A number of Spanish and Cleveland isolates were compared by electrophoretic analysis of penicillin-binding protein (PDP) profiles and DNA restriction endonuclease cleavage profiles of the PDP 2X and 2D genes amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. All strains were identical by these criteria.

One difficulty in defining bacterial species arises from the high rates of recombination that results in the transfer of DNA between relatively distantly related bacteria. Barriers to this process. which could be used to define species naturally. are not apparent. Here. we review conceptual models of bacterial speciation and describe our computer simulations of speciation. Our findings suggest that the rate of recombination and its relation to genetic divergence have a strong influence on outcomes. We propose that a distinction be made between clonal divergence and sexual speciation. Hence. to make sense of bacterial diversity. we need data not only from genetic surveys but also from experimental determination of selection pressures and recombination rates and from theoretical models.,True,cIwIY6QAAAAJ:YOwf2qJgpHMC,506,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5811/476.abstract,3840152311535422299,/scholar?cites=3840152311535422299,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2220085/,0,0,0

Findings In prospective fever studies from Asia. scrub typhus is a leading cause of treatable non-malarial febrile illness. Sero-epidemiological data also suggest that Orientia tsutsugamushi infection is common across Asia. with seroprevalence ranging from 9.3%–27.9% (median 22.2% IQR 18.6–25.7).

Research funding for vaccine development has largely considered protection within the biothreat context. but the resulting vaccines could be applicable to populations who are at risk of naturally acquired melioidosis. Here. we discuss target populations for vaccination. consider the cost-benefit of different vaccination strategies and review potential vaccine candidates.   Methods and Findings Melioidosis is highly endemic in Thailand and northern Australia. where a biodefense vaccine might be adopted for public health purposes. A cost-effectiveness analysis model was developed. which showed that a vaccine could be a cost-effective intervention in Thailand. particularly if used in high-risk populations such as diabetics. Cost-effectiveness was observed in a model in which only partial immunity was assumed. The review systematically summarized all melioidosis vaccine candidates and studies in animal models that had evaluated their protectiveness. Possible candidates included live attenuated. whole cell killed. sub-unit. plasmid DNA and dendritic cell vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines were not considered favorably because of possible reversion to virulence and hypothetical risk of latent infection. while the other candidates need further development and evaluation.

Artemisinin resistance was first detected in western Cambodia in 2007. and is now confirmed in the Greater Mekong region. raising the spectre of a malaria resurgence that could undo a decade of progress in control. and threaten the feasibility of elimination. The magnitude of this threat has not been quantified. This analysis compares the health and economic consequences of two future scenarios occurring once artemisinin-based treatments are available with high coverage. In the first scenario. artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is largely effective in the management of uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria is treated with artesunate. while in the second scenario ACT are failing at a rate of 30%. and treatment of severe malaria reverts to quinine. The model is applied to all malaria-endemic countries using their specific estimates for malaria incidence. transmission intensity and GDP. The model describes the direct medical costs for repeated diagnosis and retreatment of clinical failures as well as admission costs for severe malaria. For productivity losses. the conservative friction costing method is used. which assumes a limited economic impact for individuals that are no longer economically active until they are replaced from the unemployment pool.

While malaria rapid diagnostic tests have improved use of antimalarial drugs. there are no similar tests to guide the use of antibiotics in undifferentiated fevers. In this study we estimate the diagnostic accuracy of two well established biomarkers of bacterial infection. procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP) in discriminating between common viral and bacterial infections in malaria endemic settings of Southeast Asia. Serum procalcitonin and CRP levels were measured in stored serum samples from febrile patients enrolled in three prospective studies conducted in Cambodia. Laos and. Thailand. Of the 1372 patients with a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis. 1105 had a single viral. bacterial or malarial infection. Procalcitonin and CRP levels were compared amongst these aetiological groups and their sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing bacterial infections and bacteraemias from viral infections were estimated using standard thresholds. Serum concentrations of both biomarkers were significantly higher in bacterial infections and malaria than in viral infections. The AUROC for CRP in discriminating between bacterial and viral infections was 0.83 (0.81–0.86) compared with 0.74 (0.71–0.77) for procalcitonin (p < 0.0001). This relative advantage was evident in all sites and when stratifying patients by age and admission status.

This study’s objective was to evaluate the malaria protective efficacy of village-wide usage of ITN in Western Myanmar and estimate the cost-effectiveness of ITN compared with extending early diagnosis and treatment services. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in Rakhine State to assess the efficacy of ITNs in preventing malaria and anaemia in children and their secondary effects on nutrition and development.

Several diagnostic tests for leptospirosis are available and in some instances are being used prior to treatment of leptospirosis-suspected patients. There is therefore a need to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the different treatment strategies in order to avoid misuse of scarce resources and ensure best possible health outcomes for patients.  Methods The study population was adult patients. presented with uncomplicated acute febrile illness. without an obvious focus of infection or malaria or typical dengue infection. We compared the cost and effectiveness of 5 management strategies: 1) no patients tested or given antibiotic treatment; 2) all patients given empirical doxycycline treatment; patients given doxycycline when a patient is tested positive for leptospirosis using: 3) lateral flow; 4) MCAT; 5) latex test. The framework used is a cost-benefit analysis. accounting for all direct medical costs in diagnosing and treating patients suspected of leptospirosis. Outcomes are measured in length of fever after treatment which is then converted to productivity losses to capture the full economic costs.  Findings Empirical doxycycline treatment was the most efficient strategy. being both the least costly alternative and the one that resulted in the shortest duration of fever. The limited sensitivity of all three diagnostic tests implied that their use to guide treatment was not cost-effective. The most influential parameter driving these results was the cost of treating patients with complications for patients who did not receive adequate treatment as a result of incorrect diagnosis or a strategy of no-antibiotic …,True,TAZJIoUAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,63,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000610,5174423975285599459,/scholar?cites=5174423975285599459,,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0000610,0,0,0

However. many RDTs are available and selecting the ideal test for a particular setting is challenging. The appropriateness of RDT choice depends in part on patient population and epidemiological setting. and on decision makers' priorities. The model presented (available online) can be used by decision makers to evaluate alternative RDTs and assess the circumstances under which their use is justified on economic grounds. An interactive model based on a decision-tree structure and a cost-benefit framework was designed to compare different diagnostic strategies. Variables included in the model can be modified by users. including RDT and treatment costs. test accuracies (sensitivity and specificity). probabilities for developing severe illness. case-fatality rates. and clinician response to negative test results. To illustrate how the model can be used. a comparison is made of presumptive treatment with two available RDTs. one detecting histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2) and one detecting Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). Data inputs were obtained from a study comparing the RDTs at seven sites in Uganda. Applying the model in the illustrative Ugandan context demonstrates that if only direct expenditures are considered. the pLDH test is the preferred option for adult patients except in high transmission settings. while young children are best treated presumptively in all settings.

Most models depend on estimates of the probability that untreated patients with malaria or bacterial illnesses will progress to severe disease or death. However. data on these key parameters are lacking and assumptions are frequently made based on expert opinion. Widely diverse opinions can lead to conflicting outcomes in models they inform.   Methods and Findings A Delphi survey was conducted with malaria experts aiming to reach consensus on key parameters for public health and economic models. relating to the outcome of untreated febrile illnesses. Survey questions were stratified by malaria transmission intensity. patient age. and HIV prevalence. The impact of the variability in opinion on decision models is illustrated with a model previously used to assess the cost-effectiveness of malaria rapid diagnostic tests.

We reviewed the efficacy of a 3-day regimen of mefloquine and artesunate regimen (MAS3). over a 13 year period of continuous deployment as first-line treatment in camps for displaced persons and in clinics for migrant population along the Thai-Myanmar border.  Methods and Findings 3.264 patients were enrolled in prospective treatment trials between 1995 and 2007 and treated with MAS3. The proportion of patients with parasitaemia persisting on day-2 increased significantly from 4.5% before 2001 to 21.9% since 2002 (p<0.001). Delayed parasite clearance was associated with increased risk of developing gametocytaemia (AOR = 2.29; 95% CI. 2.00–2.69. p = 0.002). Gametocytaemia on admission and carriage also increased over the years (p = 0.001. test for trend. for both). MAS3 efficacy has declined slightly but significantly (Hazards ratio 1.13; 95% CI. 1.07–1.19. p<0.001). although efficacy in 2007 remained well within acceptable limits: 96.5% (95% CI. 91.0–98.7).

In a large global survey. we find that kelch13 mutations which cause resistance in Southeast Asia are present at low frequency in Africa. We show that African kelch13 mutations have originated locally. and that kelch13 shows a normal variation pattern relative to other genes in Africa. whereas in Southeast Asia there is a great excess of non-synonymous mutations. many of which cause radical amino-acid changes. Thus. kelch13 is not currently undergoing strong selection in Africa. despite a deep reservoir of variations that could potentially allow resistance to emerge rapidly. The practical implications are that public health surveillance for artemisinin resistance should not rely on kelch13 data alone. and interventions to prevent resistance must account for local evolutionary conditions. shown by genomic epidemiology to differ greatly between geographical regions.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08714.001,True,A3mTirUZsJwC:tBlTYpvFGQIC,168,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08714,335042627044763236,/scholar?cites=335042627044763236,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/08714.pdf,0,0,0

A multilocus sequence typing scheme was developed to genotype these pathogenic Leptospira. Additional typing was performed for Leptospira isolated from human cases in other Thai provinces over the same period. and from rodents captured in the northeast during 2004. Sequence types (STs) were compared with those of Leptospira drawn from a reference collection. Twelve STs were identified among 101 isolates from patients in Udon Thani. One of these (ST34) accounted for 77 (76%) of isolates. ST34 was Leptospira interrogans. serovar Autumnalis. 86% of human Leptospira isolates from Udon Thani corresponded to ST34 in 2000/2001. but this figure fell to 56% by 2005 as the outbreak waned (p = 0.01).

The modified scheme was used to further characterize 325 isolates (L. alexanderi [n = 5]. L. borgpetersenii [n = 34]. L. interrogans [n = 222]. L. kirschneri [n = 29]. L. noguchii [n = 9]. L. santarosai [n = 10]. and L. weilii [n = 16]). Phylogenetic analysis using concatenated sequences of the 7 loci demonstrated that each species corresponded to a discrete clade. and that no strains were misclassified at the species level. Comparison between genotype and serovar was possible for 254 isolates. Of the 31 sequence types (STs) represented by at least two isolates. 18 STs included isolates assigned to two or three different serovars. Conversely. 14 serovars were identified that contained between 2 to 10 different STs. New observations were made on the global phylogeography of Leptospira spp.. and the utility of MLST in making associations between human disease and specific maintenance hosts was demonstrated.

Day,6,PLoS One,1,e16236,,Background Rapid PCR-based tests for the diagnosis of leptospirosis can provide information that contributes towards early patient management. but these have not been adopted in Thailand. Here. we compare the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of two real-time PCR assays targeting rrs or lipL32 for the diagnosis of leptospirosis in northeast Thailand.   Methods/Principal Findings A case-control study of 266 patients (133 cases of leptospirosis and 133 controls) was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (DSe & DSp) of both PCR assays. The median duration of illness prior to admission of cases was 4 days (IQR 2–5 days; range 1–12 days). DSe and DSp were determined using positive culture and/or microscopic agglutination test (MAT) as the gold standard. The DSe was higher for the rrs assay than the lipL32 assay (56%. (95% CI 47–64%) versus 43%. (95% CI 34–52%). p<0.001). No cases were positive for the lipL32 assay alone. There was borderline evidence to suggest that the DSp of the rrs assay was lower than the lipL32 assay (90% (95% CI 83–94%) versus 93%. (95%CI 88–97%). p = 0.06). Nine controls gave positive reactions for both assays and 5 controls gave a positive reaction for the rrs assay alone. The DSe of the rrs and lipL32 assays were high in the subgroup of 39 patients who were culture positive for Leptospira spp. (95% and 87%. respectively. p = 0.25).

The remaining 46 isolates were resolved into 21 sequence types (STs) by 7L. and 30 genotypes by 6L. Overall nucleotide diversity (based on concatenated sequence) was 3.6% and 2.3% for 7L and 6L. respectively. The D value (discriminatory ability) of 7L and 6L were comparable. i.e. 92.0 (95% CI 87.5–96.5) vs. 93.5 (95% CI 88.6–98.4). The dN/dS ratios calculated for each locus indicated that none were under positive selection. Neighbor joining trees were reconstructed based on the concatenated sequences for each scheme. Both trees showed two distinct groups corresponding to L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. and both identified two clones containing 10 and 7 clinical isolates. respectively. There were six instances in which 6L split single STs as defined by 7L into closely related clusters. We noted two discrepancies between the trees in which the genetic relatedness between two pairs of strains were more closely related by 7L than by 6L.

More than 2000 culture-confirmed cases of melioidosis are diagnosed in general hospitals with microbiology laboratories in this region each year. The mortality rate is around 35%. Melioidosis is endemic throughout Thailand. but it is still not uncommon that microbiological facilities misidentify Burkholderia pseudomallei as a contaminant or another organism.
