For example. autophagy in yeast is primarily a response to the stress of nutrient limitation. Autophagy is a catabolic process for the degradation and recycling of cytosolic. long lived. or aggregated proteins and excess or defective organelles. In this study. we demonstrate a new pathway for the induction of autophagy. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). accumulation of misfolded proteins causes stress and activates the unfolded protein response to induce the expression of chaperones and proteins involved in the recovery process. ER stress stimulated the assembly of the pre-autophagosomal structure. In addition. autophagosome formation and transport to the vacuole were stimulated in an Atg protein-dependent manner. Finally.

The main characteristic of autophagy is the formation of a double‐membrane vesicle. the autophagosome. which envelops part of the cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome/vacuole for breakdown and eventual recycling of the degradation products. Among the approximately 30 autophagy‐related (Atg) genes identified so far. there are two ubiquitin‐like proteins. Atg12 and Atg8. Analogous to ubiquitination.

Four physiological gonadal phases were defined: 1) stasis (Dec.~ Feb.); 2) recovery (Mar.~ Apr.); 3) spawning (May~ June); and 4) post-spawning (July~ Nov.). Specific changes in plasma sex hormone levels were found to occur during the different phases of gonadal development. Plasma androgen levels presented a biphasic profile. with peaks corresponding to the end of the stasis phase (Feb.) and during the spawning phase (June). High levels of estradiol-17β were detectable from the early recovery phase (Apr.) to the late spawning phase (June).

Recently. some species of this algal class have been shown to produce abortifacient compounds (aldehydes) that block copepod embryogenesis. thereby acting as a form of birth control for predatory copepods. To test if diatoms also have deleterious effects on postembryonic development. several diatom species were used to rear larval stages of the calanoid copepod Temora stylifera to adulthood. Our results show that T. stylifera was only able to complete development from hatching to adulthood when reared with the flagellates Isochrysis galbana and the dinoflagellates Prorocentrum minimum and Oxyrrhis marina.

This paper presents an overview on microalgae with anti-cancer activities. Microalgae are eukaryotic unicellular plants that contribute up to 40% of global primary productivity. They are excellent sources of pigments. lipids. carotenoids. omega-3 fatty acids. polysaccharides. vitamins and other fine chemicals. and there is an increasing demand for their use as nutraceuticals and food supplements. Some microalgae are also reported as having anti-cancer activity. In this review. we report the microalgal species that have shown anti-cancer properties. the cancer cell lines affected by algae and the concentrations of compounds/extracts tested to induce arrest of cell growth. We also report the mediums used for growing microalgae that showed anti-cancer activity and compare the bioactivity of these microalgae with marine anticancer drugs already on the market and in phase III clinical trials. Finally. we discuss why some microalgae can be promising sources of anti-cancer compounds for future development.

However. many diatom species produce polyunsaturated aldehydes that disrupt development in the offspring of grazers that feed on these unicellular algae. Here we provide evidence that production of the physiological messenger nitric oxide increases after treatment with the polyunsaturated aldehyde decadienal in embryos of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. At high decadienal concentrations. nitric oxide mediates initial apoptotic events leading to loss of mitochondrial functionality through the generation of peroxynitrite. At low decadienal concentrations. nitric oxide contributes to the activation of hsp70 gene expression thereby protecting embryos against the toxic effects of this aldehyde. When nitric oxide levels were lowered by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase activity. the expression of hsp70 in swimming blastula decreased and the proportion of abnormal plutei increased. However. in later pluteus stages nitric oxide was no longer able to exert this protective function: hsp70 and nitric oxide synthase expression decreased with a consequent increase in the expression of caspase-8. Our findings that nitric oxide production increases rapidly in response to a toxic exogenous stimulus opens new perspectives on the possible role of this gas as an important messenger to environmental stress in sea urchins and for understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying toxicity during diatom blooms.,True,lQEKP6UAAAAJ:Zph67rFs4hoC,51,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025980,15736606260884054761,/scholar?cites=15736606260884054761,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025980,0,0,0

Incubation of 0.5 mM tyrosine with 0.07 U/ml tyrosinase in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 in the presence of 0.5 mM HQ led to no detectable melanin formation. due to the preferential oxidation of HQ with respect to tyrosine (HPLC evidence).

However. many diatom species produce polyunsaturated aldehydes that disrupt development in the offspring of grazers that feed on these unicellular algae. Here we provide evidence that production of the physiological messenger nitric oxide increases after treatment with the polyunsaturated aldehyde decadienal in embryos of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. At high decadienal concentrations. nitric oxide mediates initial apoptotic events leading to loss of mitochondrial functionality through the generation of peroxynitrite. At low decadienal concentrations. nitric oxide contributes to the activation of hsp70 gene expression thereby protecting embryos against the toxic effects of this aldehyde. When nitric oxide levels were lowered by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase activity. the expression of hsp70 in swimming blastula decreased and the proportion of abnormal plutei increased. However. in later pluteus stages nitric oxide was no longer able to exert this protective function: hsp70 and nitric oxide synthase expression decreased with a consequent increase in the expression of caspase-8. Our findings that nitric oxide production increases rapidly in response to a toxic exogenous stimulus opens new perspectives on the possible role of this gas as an important messenger to environmental stress in sea urchins and for understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying toxicity during diatom blooms.,True,2FMaThUAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,51,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025980,15736606260884054761,/scholar?cites=15736606260884054761,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025980,0,0,0

Indeed a careful investigation is needed in order to exclude possible harmful side effects related to the use of nanotechnology. The effect that the nanoparticles may have on the marine organisms depends on their size. chemical composition. surface structure. solubility. shape and how the individual nanoparticles aggregate together. In order to make the most of their potential. without polluting the environment. many researchers are trying to trap them into some kind of matrix that keeps them active but avoids their dispersion in the environment. In this study we have tested nanocomposite membranes prepared using Nafion polymer combined with various fillers. such as anatase-type TiO2 nanoparticles and graphene oxide. The non-toxicity of these nanocomposites. already shown to be effective for water purification applications in our previous studies. was recognized by testing the effect of tDahe different materials on zebrafish embryos. Zebrafish was considered an excellent model for ecotoxicological studies andfor this reason zebrafish embryos were exposed to different concentrations of free nanoparticles and to the nanocomposite membranes. As biomarkers of exposure. we evaluated the expression of heme-oxygenase 1 and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthases by immunohistochemistry and gene expression.

Traditionally. they have been regarded as beneficial to the growth and survival of marine organisms. and to the transfer of organic material through the marine food chain to top consumers and important fisheries.

Here we focus on bioactive compounds and interactions associated with phytoplankton. particularly bloom-forming diatoms. prymnesiophytes and dinoflagellates. Planktonic bioactive metabolites are structurally and functionally diverse and some may have multiple simultaneous functions including roles in chemical defense (antipredator. allelopathic and antibacterial compounds). and/or cell-to-cell signaling (eg. polyunsaturated aldehydes (PUAs) of diatoms). Among inducible chemical defenses in response to grazing. there is high species-specific variability in the effects on grazers. ranging from severe physical incapacitation and/or death to no apparent physiological response. depending on predator susceptibility and detoxification capability. Most bioactive compounds are present in very low concentrations. in both the producing organism and the surrounding aqueous medium. Furthermore. bioactivity may be subject to synergistic interactions with other natural and anthropogenic environmental toxicants. Most. if not all phycotoxins are classic secondary metabolites. but many other bioactive metabolites are simple molecules derived from primary metabolism (eg. PUAs in diatoms. dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in prymnesiophytes). Producing cells do not seem to suffer physiological impact due to their synthesis.

The interest in this issue arose after biologically plausible mechanisms for this association were identified: most of these suggested a key role for calcium intake from dairy products. although calcium-independent mechanisms have also been proposed. Data from cross-sectional epidemiological studies support the hypothesis that a dairy food-rich diet is associated with lower fat accumulation in adults and children; however. prospective studies and randomised controlled intervention trials have yielded inconsistent results. Different reasons could explain these findings that regard the evaluation of either the “exposure” (i.e. the methodological problems in the assessment of dietary intake of nutrients over a long time) and the “outcome” (i.e. multiple factors involved in the …,True,uZmm-BAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,119,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475306001104,13246574767827176330,/scholar?cites=13246574767827176330,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47145209/j.numecd.2006.04.00420160710-1897-2apii7.pdf,0,0,0

Small quantities of urine from familiar residents. neighbours and unfamiliar males of dominant or subordinate social status were introduced onto naturally established urine posts. Introduced urine differentially altered behaviour between dominant territorial males. intruders and resident subordinates. producing complex patterns of change which were in agreement with predictions.

Consequently. there is little agreement about how impairment of welfare should be measured. While some solutions to this have been suggested. these have usually relied on more sophisticated versions of. or more control over. existing measures. However. we argue that the difficulties arise because of questionable assumptions in the definition and measurement of welfare. in particular the measurement of suffering and the assumed importance of individual well-being. We contend that welfare can be interpreted only in terms of what natural selection has designed an organism to do and how circumstances impinge on its functional design.

We show that darcin. an involatile protein sex pheromone in male mouse urine. can rapidly condition preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent. Learned spatial preference is conditioned through contact with darcin in a single trial and remembered for approximately 14 days.

In this study. we show how dietary administration of stable isotope‐labelled amino acids can obtain information on the relative rates of synthesis and degradation of individual proteins in a proteome. The pattern of stable isotope‐labelling in tryptic peptides can be deconstructed to yield a highly reliable measure of the isotope abundance of the precursor pool. a parameter that is often difficult to acquire.

It was reported previously that Golli-BG21. a member of the MBP (myelin basic protein) family of proteins. regulates SOCE (store-operated Ca2+ entry) in T-cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. but the underlying mechanism for this regulation is unknown. In the present study we have discovered that Golli can directly interact with the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) Ca2+-sensing protein STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1). Golli interacts with the C-terminal domain of STIM1 in both in vitro and in vivo binding assays and this interaction may be modulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.

1218961,Modeling studies of the change in conformation required for cleavage of limited proteolytic sites,1994,SJ Hubbard and F Eisenmenger and JM Thornton,3,Protein Science,5,757-768,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,Previous analyses of limited proteolytic sites within native. folded protein structures have shown that a significant conformational change is required in order to facilitate binding into the active site of the attacking proteinase. For the serine proteinases. the optimum conformation to match the proteinase binding‐site geometry has been well characterized crystallographically by the conserved main‐chain geometry of the reactive site loops of their protein inhibitors. A good substrate must adopt a conformation very similar to this “target” main‐chain conformation prior to cleavage. Using a “loop‐closure” modeling approach. we have tested the ability of a set of trypticlimited proteolytic sites to achieve this target conformation and further tested their suitability for cleavage. The results show that in most cases. significant changes in the conformation of at least 12 residues are required.

Here we report a detailed comparative analysis of the genome sequences of thirty-six species of fungi and oomycetes. including seven plant pathogenic species. that aims to explore the common genetic features associated with plant disease-causing species. The predicted translational products of each genome have been clustered into groups of potential orthologues using Markov Chain Clustering and the data integrated into the e-Fungi object-oriented data warehouse (http://www.e-fungi.org.uk/). Analysis of the species distribution of members of these clusters has identified proteins that are specific to filamentous fungal species and a group of proteins found only in plant pathogens. By comparing the gene inventories of filamentous. ascomycetous phytopathogenic and free-living species of fungi. we have identified a set of gene families that appear to have expanded during the evolution of phytopathogens and may therefore serve important roles in plant disease. We have also characterised the predicted set of secreted proteins encoded by each genome and identified a set of protein families which are significantly over-represented in the secretomes of plant pathogenic fungi. including putative effector proteins that might perturb host cell biology during plant infection.

Although relative quantification techniques are more commonplace and central to discovery proteomics. most assays require absolute quantification.

QconCATs are created by concatenating peptide sequences taken from the target proteins into artificial proteins. The QconCAT acts as a source of internal standards and enables parallel absolute quantification of multiple proteins. QconCATs are typically applied in targeted proteomic workflows and so benefit from the greater sensitivity and wider dynamic range of these approaches.

Here we describe a quantitative proteomics approach to assess differences in the sputum proteome between cystic fibrosis (CF) patients based on gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) measures.Methods: Spontaneous sputum samples were collected from CF subjects (n=37). and sputum was induced from healthy volunteers (HV. n=33) for comparison. The sputum proteome was analysed by bottom-up shotgun proteomic analysis. All CF patients had GOR measured using 24-hour pH-impedance; sputum samples were compared from those with the highest (n=5) and lowest (n=5) risk for reflux aspiration. based on total. proximal and/or supine reflux episodes. Results: There were significant differences between …,True,pRcOGJsAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,0,https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/54/suppl_63/PA974.abstract,,,,,0,0,0

Explaining genital diversity is a longstanding problem that is attracting renewed interest from evolutionary biologists. New studies provide ever more compelling evidence that sexual selection is important in driving genital divergence. Importantly. several studies now link variation in genital morphology directly to male fertilization success. and modern comparative techniques have confirmed predicted associations between genital complexity and mating patterns across species. There is also evidence that male and female genitalia can coevolve antagonistically.

Here we present a comparative study whose aim is to investigate the effect of relative intensity of sperm competition on investment in spermatogenesis and the number and size of sperm produced. We find that both the gonadosomatic index (GSI = [gonad weight/body weight] x 100) and sperm numbers increase with intensity of sperm competition across species but that sperm length decreases. These new findings are consistent with a raffle‐based mode of sperm competition in fishes. Most of these results (positive correlation of the GSI and sperm number with sperm competition intensity) concur with the predictions of current sperm competition theory.

Male roles (first or second to mate) are determined randomly. In model 1. males have no information about the risk associated with individual females and ejaculation strategy depends only on the probability. q. that females mate twice. Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) ejaculate expenditure increases linearly from zero with q. and reduces with increasing inequality between ejaculates. though the direction of the loading (which role is favoured) is unimportant.

The relation between sperm competition intensity and sperm expenditure can be radically different across species from that within a species. Across species. the average ejaculate expenditure will increase with the average intensity of sperm competition. But within a species. the reverse trend is generally predicted for greater than two males competing for the same set of eggs. These effects are demonstrated with three sperm competition game models.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1334,391-399,The Royal Society,Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) males mature as either tiny precocious parr before seaward migration. or as older and larger anadromous males. Anadromous males dominate the spawning redds and aggressively defend females against parr intrusions. Parr gain fertilizations by sneaking in to ejaculate while anadromous males and females spawn. Such differences in mating advantage generate asymmetries in risk of sperm competition between the male strategies. Theoretical sperm competition models predict that males typically mating in disfavoured roles (here. the parr strategy) should be selected to offset this disadvantage by investing more into spermatogenesis to achieve fertilization success. First. we present a theoretical model which analyses gametic expenditure for salmon parr and anadromous male reproductive strategies.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1341,173-179,The Royal Society,Three hypotheses concerning potential genetic benefits of female multiple mating behaviour are evaluated for the common shrew. In a high-density population. many successful copulations took place between individuals estimated to be close relatives (e.g. full or half siblings). Juveniles resulting from such matings tended to be relatively small at weaning. and were generally less likely to survive to sexual maturity than more outbred individuals. Multiple paternity was discovered in eight of nine litters examined. The incidence of matings between close relatives. the cost of inbreeding. and the high incidence of multiple paternity presented are each consistent with the hypothesis that female multiple mating is a strategy to reduce inbreeding. That is. if females cannot always distinguish close kin. then they may copulate with several different males and so reduce the risk that all their offspring will be sired by a close relative.,True,tQ5mD_IAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,247,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.1993.0143,7836111653352749023,/scholar?cites=7836111653352749023,,,0,0,0

Nevertheless. it is increasingly clear that females of many. if not most. taxa do copulate with multiple males (e.g. Birkhead and Wier. 1998). Moreover. polyandry is widespread despite considerable costs. including wasted time and energy. increased risk of predation and disease. potential damage caused by male seminal fluids and copulatory organs. and even death (Keller and Reeve. 1995; Eberhard. 1996).

After control for phylogeny. promiscuous species were found to have significantly lower rates of early reproductive failure than monogamous and polygynous species. in which females are relatively monandrous.

Conflicts can arise. for example. when males are successful in imposing monandry at a cost to female fitness. or when females impose monogyny on males. Conflict over remating can also generate monogamy. For example. when males invest heavily in attempting to impose female monandry. the cost of their investment may prevent them from securing additional mates.

Such selection may cause seminal fluid to evolve rapidly. with potentially important consequences for speciation. Here we investigate the evolution of seminal fluid proteins in a major mammalian radiation. the muroid rodents. by quantifying diversity in seminal fluid proteome composition for the first time across a broad range of closely related species. Using comparative proteomics techniques to identify and cross-match proteins. we demonstrate that rodent seminal fluid is highly diverse at the level of both proteomes and individual proteins.

Here we argue that the problems originally encountered in partitioning variation in non-random mating between male competition and female choice are even more pertinent to interpreting patterns of non-random paternity because of intense sperm competition between males. We describe an experiment with the yellow dung fly. Scatophaga stercoraria. designed to partition variance in the proportion of offspring sired by the second male. P 2. between males and females. and to control for sperm competition. Large males were shown to have a higher P 2 than small males but P 2 was independent of the size of the female’s first mate.

Scatophaga stercoraria: An Investigation of Male and Female Processes,1999,LW Simmons and GA Parker and P Stockley,153,The American Naturalist,3,302-314,The University of Chicago Press, Despite the ubiquity with which patterns of sperm utilization have been studied. the mechanisms underlying fertilization in insects are far from clear. One well‐studied system is the yellow dung fly. in which the last male's ejaculate is thought to displace rival sperm from the female's sperm stores. Here we follow the movement of the copulating male's ejaculate through the female's reproductive tract using males labeled with different radioisotopes. We find that males ejaculate into the bursa copulatrix and that male‐1 sperm are displaced from the spermathecae during copulation. The increase in male‐2 ejaculate in the spermathecae matches the pattern of male‐2 fertilization gain. indicating that only spermathecal sperm are utilized at fertilization. Previously we have analyzed this system with a direct model of sperm displacement in which the male displaces rival sperm from the spermathecae.

Series B: Biological Sciences,1429,1663-1669,The Royal Society,Sperm selection may be said to occur if females influence the relative success of ejaculates competing to fertilize their ova. Most evidence that female animals or their ova are capable of sperm selection relates to male genetic incompatibility. although relatively few studies focus on competition between conspecific males. Here I look for evidence of sperm selection with respect to relatedness of mates. Reduced fitness or inbreeding effects in offspring resulting from copulations between close relatives are well documented. If females are capable of sperm selection. they might therefore be expected to discriminate against the sperm of sibling males during sperm competition. I describe an experimental protocol designed to test for evidence of sperm selection while controlling for inbreeding effects. Using decorated field crickets (Gryllodes supplicans).

1219025,Sperm competition and sperm length influence the rate of mammalian spermatogenesis,2010,Steven A Ramm and Paula Stockley,6,Biology Letters,2,219-221,The Royal Society,Sperm competition typically favours an increased investment in testes. because larger testes can produce more sperm to provide a numerical advantage in competition with rival ejaculates. However. interspecific variation in testis size cannot be equated directly with variation in sperm production rate—which is the trait ultimately selected under sperm competition—because there are also differences between species in the proportion of spermatogenic tissue contained within the testis and in the time it takes to produce each sperm. Focusing on the latter source of variation. we provide phylogenetically controlled evidence for mammals that species with relatively large testes (and hence a high level of sperm competition) have a shorter duration of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium and consequently a faster rate of spermatogenesis. enabling males to produce more sperm per unit testis per unit time.

Sperm competition (i.e. competition between sperm from different males to fertilize the ova of a female) is widespread among mammals. 2. Recent ESS models of sperm competition suggest that it may sometimes pay for males within a population to invest differentially in ejaculates. These models lead to the prediction that. in mammals. small males within a population should invest proportionately more in sperm production than large males. where breeding is continuous. 3. We test this prediction by comparing intraspecific relationships between body size and testis size in seasonal and continuous breeders.

Males may therefore be sensitive to cues in their social environment associated with sexual competition. and tailor investment in sperm production accordingly. We tested this idea experimentally for the first time. to our knowledge. in a mammal by comparing reproductive traits of male house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) that had experienced contrasting encounter regimes with potential sexual competitors. We found that daily sperm production and numbers of sperm in the caput epididymis were significantly higher in subjects that had experienced a high encounter rate of social cues from three other males compared to those that had experienced a low encounter rate of social cues from just one other male.

To explore gene overexpression phenotypes systematically. we assembled an array of 5280 yeast strains. each containing an inducible copy of an S. cerevisiae gene. covering >80% of the genome. Approximately 15% of the overexpressed genes (769) reduced growth rate. This gene set was enriched for cell cycle-regulated genes. signaling molecules. and transcription factors. Overexpression of most toxic genes resulted in phenotypes different from known deletion mutant phenotypes. suggesting that overexpression phenotypes usually reflect a specific regulatory imbalance rather than disruption of protein complex stoichiometry.

A Wiley Company,It is considered in some quarters that hypothesis‐driven methods are the only valuable. reliable or significant means of scientific advance. Data‐driven or ‘inductive’ advances in scientific knowledge are then seen as marginal. irrelevant. insecure or wrong‐headed. while the development of technology—which is not of itself ‘hypothesis‐led’ (beyond the recognition that such tools might be of value)—must be seen as equally irrelevant to the hypothetico‐deductive scientific agenda. We argue here that data‐ and technology‐driven programmes are not alternatives to hypothesis‐led studies in scientific knowledge discovery but are complementary and iterative partners with them. Many fields are data‐rich but hypothesis‐poor. Here. computational methods of data analysis. which may be automated. provide the means of generating novel hypotheses. especially in the post‐genomic era.

Inhibition of proteasomal activity with lactacystin leads to a block in the endocytic trafficking of Met such that the receptor fails to reach late endosomes/lysosomes. where degradation by acid-dependent proteases takes place . In this article. we have biochemically determined Met internalization rates from the cell surface and shown that lactacystin does not inhibit the initial HGF-dependent internalization step of Met. Instead. it promotes the recycling pathway from early endosomes at the expense of sorting to late endosomes. thereby ensuring rapid return of internalized Met to the cell surface. We have used this perturbation of Met endosomal sorting by lactacystin to examine the consequences for HGF-dependent signaling outputs.

Mounting evidence suggests that prostate cancer deposits exist within a hypoxic environment and this contributes to radio-resistance thus hampering one of the major therapies for this cancer. Recent reports have shown that nitric oxide (NO) donating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduced tumour hypoxia as well as maintaining a radio-sensitising/therapeutic effect on prostate cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypoxia on the proteome of the prostate and to establish whether NO-NSAID treatment reverted the protein profiles back to their normoxic status.

Female choice of males has been shown to vary according to male familiarity. but interestingly in some species this favours familiar males. while in others unfamiliar males are preferred. Preference for unfamiliar partners might result from the attempt to minimise inbreeding costs by avoiding mating with individuals encountered during development. or with those sharing relatedness cues.

NY,Females of many species choose to mate with relatively unrelated males in order to ensure outbred. heterozygous offspring. There is some evidence to suggest that the MHC is involved in mate choice decisions. either because MHC heterozygous offspring are more resistant to disease. or because the highly detectable odours associated with this region allow it to act as a marker of general inbreeding. To determine which role the MHC plays it is necessary to disentangle this region from the genetic background. a requirement which has generally proven difficult to achieve. We argue that the emphasis on MHC’s role in mate choice has resulted in other potential markers of inbreeding being neglected. and discuss the evidence for MHC disassortative mating. the interaction with genetic background. and a possible role for alternative markers of inbreeding.,True,M6M6gjQAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,15,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-73945-8_28,14737942909731025250,/scholar?cites=14737942909731025250,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rob_Beynon2/publication/227182803_Scent_Mate_Choice_and_Genetic_Heterozygosity/links/09e4150630f9877c77000000/Scent-Mate-Choice-and-Genetic-Heterozygosity.pdf,0,0,0

This mimics a species in which mate assessment and choice are temporally separate. such as when females observe males in direct conflict and must subsequently locate the winner.

Like many of the mustelid family. mink are elongate with short legs (Dunstone 1993) and are sexually dimorphic (males. on average. weigh almost twice as much as females. see Table 6.1). In contrast to the other more terrestrial mustelids. mink have partially webbed toes (although polecats can also swim. mink are more efficient swimmers; Lodé 1999. Williams 1983). American mink are solitary. they breed once yearly (both males and females mating with several partners). generally between late February and early April (Birks 1981; Ireland 1990; Dunstone 1993). and females give birth to five to eight kits between late April and mid May. Juvenile mink disperse from their natal range at the age of about three months. in July or August (Dunstone 1993).As its name implies. the American mink is native to North America. so why is it relevant to a book on conservation on lowland British farmland?

Males have evolved remarkable adaptations to increase their reproductive success under postcopulatory sexual selection. which in many species includes the ability to modify behaviour and ejaculate characteristics plastically to match the perceived level of sperm competition. Males of the model species Drosophila melanogaster increase mating duration and modify seminal fluid composition in response to short-term changes in sperm competition risk. If these responses increase a male's total investment in reproduction. he must either trade-off this cost against other life-history traits or suffer reduced survival.

New York,Neovison vison (American mink) is a small. semi-aquatic carnivore of the weasel family Mustelidae (Figure 31.1). Although the American mink shares its common name with the European mink Mustela lutreola. molecular evidence suggests that the American species is in fact an outgroup of the Mustela species (see Harding and Smith. 2009). This is reflected in the recent reassignment of the species to the new genus Neovison. which it shares with the extinct sea mink N. macrodon (Wozencraft. 2005). American mink fossils are known from the Pleistocene fauna of North America. and although only around 20 samples have been found. it appears that the extent of the species’ geographic range has contracted since the Pleistocene (Kurten and Anderson. 1980).The native distribution of the American mink presently covers much of North America from the Arctic Circle to the southernmost zones of the US and into Mexico (eg Linscombe et al. 1982). The mink’s valuable pelt has driven its spread by humans far beyond its native range and. as a consequence of escapes and intentional releases from fur farms. numerous wild populations have become established in many parts of Europe.

Existing experimental paradigms have demonstrated that animals can discriminate between classes of MHC-associated odour with great acuity. Furthermore. experiments on mate choice and kin selection provide convincing evidence of a functional role for these odours. At the moment. evidence for genuine individual recognition or discrimination. meaning the “learned discrimination among conspecific individuals” (Halpin. 1986; p. 44). is lacking. This is partly because the four main experimental paradigms have not been used explicitly to address the question of individual recognition. but rather to test whether broader subgroups of MHC-associated odours exist and are distinguishable.

Evidence of such plasticity has been found in several laboratory and field studies. but little is known about the cues stimulating these responses in natural populations. One way in which males appear to assess sperm competition risk is through encounter rates with conspecific males. Such encounter rates may be driven by the spatial distribution of resources required by males (i.e. food patches or potential mates). which in turn affects local density.

But how unique in the global population do these signals need to be? While human faces are highly variable. each person interacts with many fewer individuals than are found in the total population.

We use an individual‐based model in which individuals broadcast their identity and quality in separate. genetically‐coded signals. Mimicking. for example. scent marking mammal species. females in the model assess males using the quality signal. then attempt to relocate the highest quality male using his identity signal.

They play critical roles in recognition events. act as energy stores and provide structural stability at both molecular and cellular levels. Technologies capable of fully elucidating the structures of glycans are far behind the other ‘-omic’ fields. Liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) are currently the most useful techniques for high-throughput analysis of glycans.

Since the 1960s an increasing interest has developed in the use of environmental biomarker compounds to monitor levels of human and animal waste introduced to marine and terrestrial environments; the relative stability of these compounds enabling both spatial and long-term temporal studies to be realized (eg. Walker et al.. 1982; Vivian. 1986; Evershed and Bethell. 1996 and references therein). The specificity of particular biomarkers for different faecal sources makes their use particularly attractive especially in circumstances where deducing the origin of sewage constituting a pollution event is crucial. Research into organic matter in the marine and terrestrial environments over the last 20 years has led to the development of two main groups of organic compounds found in faecal matter that can be used to monitor sewage. namely: 5b-stanols and bile acids.

Strong synergy arises between these two techniques because of their ability to ascertain complementary information about gas-phase ions. Ion mobility separates ions (from small molecules up to megadalton protein complexes) based on their differential mobility through a buffer gas. Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) can thus act as a tool to separate complex mixtures. to resolve ions that may be indistinguishable by mass spectrometry alone. or to determine structural information (for example rotationally averaged cross-sectional area). complementary to more traditional structural approaches.

Western blotting is most often used for protein identification or relative quantification. but can also be deployed for absolute quantification if appropriate calibration standards are used. MS based techniques offer superior data quality and reproducibility. but WB offers greater sensitivity and accessibility to most researchers. It would be advantageous to apply both techniques for orthogonal quantification. but workflows rarely overlap.

Boston. MA,The presence of high concentrations of protein in the urine of many mammals is often a pathological event reflecting a failure of the renal mechanisms to prevent passage of plasma proteins through the glomerular filter. or for recovery of protein in the proximal tubule. In adult humans. for example. the normal urinary protein concentration is of the order of 50μg/ml. a value that serves to emphasise the remarkable protein output in the urine of mice. and to a lesser extent rats. The average protein concentration in the house mouse (Mus domesticus) reaches between 200 and 2000 times that of a normal human. at concentrations of the order of 30mg/ml.

Boston. MA,The Major Urinary Proteins (MUPs) are abundant in the urine of house mice (Finlayson and Baumann 1958). They have a characteristic eight-stranded β-barrel structure. which incorporates a central. hydrophobic pocket or calyx (Böcskei et al.. 1992; Zidek et al.. 1999 a. b). This distinctive structure is common to a number of other proteins. collectively called the Lipocalin Superfamily (Flower et al.. 1993).

In the current study. the protective effects of green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract (GTE) against AZA-induced hepatotoxicity in rats were evaluated. AZA was administered ip as a single dose (50 mg/Kg BW) to adult male rats. A group of rats were given 1.5% GTE orally 7 days pre-and 14 days post-AZA-intoxication as the sole source of drinking water (average 2× 250 ml/day/rat). Histopathological investigations of the liver were performed on all the study groups. AZA administration to rats resulted in elevation of serum transaminases (sALT and sAST). depletion of liver reduced glutathione (GSH). accumulation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and elevation of lipid peroxides (LPO). Also. AZA treatment resulted in inhibition of the hepatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Furthermore.

Factors which play a role in this toxicity are still ambiguous and no specific treatment was ascertained. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective role of silymarin to attenuate the nephrotoxicity induced by a single oral dose (3 g/kg) of APAP in rats. Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were used: control. silymarin. APAP and silymarin plus APAP-receiving animals. Interestingly. oral supplementation of silymarin (200 mg/kg/day) for nine days before APAP intoxication dramatically reduced APAP-induced nephrotoxicity as evidenced by measuring serum total protein. serum urea. creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urinary excretions of NAG (N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase). Silymarin administration markedly prevented the generation of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) with substantial improvement in terms of reduced glutathione content (GSH) and activities of antioxidant enzymes in the kidney homogenates. Nitric oxide (NO) levels of urine and renal tissue were significantly inhibited in silymarin pre-treated animals. Furthermore. silymarin administration significantly inhibited the reduction of kidney content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) parcels associated with this nephropathy.

Although many genes are now known to be regulated at the translational level. in general. the mechanisms are poorly understood. We have previously presented polysomal gradient and array-based evidence that translational control is widespread in a significant number of genes when yeast cells are exposed to a range of stresses.

Inc.,Quantitative proteomics experiments are usually performed using proteolytic peptides as surrogates for their parent proteins. inferring protein amounts from peptide-level quantitation. This process is frequently dependent on complete digestion of the parent protein to its limit peptides so that their signal is truly representative. Unfortunately. proteolysis is often incomplete. and missed cleavage peptides are frequently produced that are unlikely to be optimal surrogates for quantitation. particularly for label-mediated approaches seeking to derive absolute values. We have generated a predictive computational tool that is able to predict which candidate proteolytic peptide bonds are likely to be missed by the standard enzyme trypsin.

Ground sloths belong to the South American xenarthrans. a group with modern although morphologically and ecologically very different representatives (anteaters. armadillos and sloths). which has been proposed to be one of the four main eutherian clades. Recently. proteomics analyses of bone collagen have recently been used to yield a molecular phylogeny for a range of mammals including the unusual ‘Malagasy aardvark’ shown to be most closely related to the afrotherian tenrecs. and the south American ungulates supporting their morphological association with condylarths. However. proteomics results generate partial sequence information that could impact upon the phylogenetic placement that has not been appropriately tested. For comparison. this paper examines the phylogenetic potential of proteomics-based sequencing through the analysis of collagen extracted from two extinct giant ground sloths. Lestodon and Megatherium. The ground sloths were placed as sister taxa to extant sloths. but with a closer relationship between Lestodon and the extant sloths than the basal Megatherium.

These issues preclude direct quantification from signal intensity alone in the absence of a standard. A deeper understanding of the governing principles of peptide ionization and exploitation of the inherent ionization and detection parameters of individual peptides is thus of great value. Here. using the yeast proteome as a model system. we establish the concept of peptide F-factor as a measure of detectability. closely related to ionization efficiency.

However. dysregulation of IL-13 can also contribute to the pathogenesis of atopic and fibrotic diseases such as allergic asthma. Matrix remodelling is an important component of repair processes in the lung but also a hallmark of chronic conditions involving fibrosis. Hence. understanding the role of IL-13 in tissue remodelling has important clinical implications. Since IL-13 shares receptors and signalling pathways with IL-4. disentangling the relative contributions of these type 2 cytokines has been challenging. Additionally. little is known about the singular role of IL-13 following acute tissue injury. In this study. we used Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection as a model of acute lung tissue damage and repair. comparing responses between WT and IL-13-deficient mice. in which IL-4 signalling is intact. Importantly. we found that IL-13 played a critical role in limiting tissue injury and haemorrhaging in the lung following infection. Through proteomic and transcriptomic profiling. we identified IL-13-dependent changes in matrix and associated regulators. We further showed that IL-13 is required for the induction of epithelial-derived type 2 effector molecules such as RELM-alpha and surfactant protein D. Pathway analyses predicted that IL-13 was heavily involved in the induction of cellular stress responses and regulation of lung epithelial cell differentiation by suppression of Foxa2 pathways. Thus. we propose that IL-13 has tissue-protective functions during lung injury and regulates epithelial cell responses during type 2 immunity in …,True,JT40_ZEAAAAJ:4TOpqqG69KYC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.337949v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/10/14/2020.10.14.337949.full.pdf,0,0,0

In breast tissue. high mammographic density (HMD). which reflects greater organisation and stiffness of the periductal collagen. represents a significant risk factor for cancer. However. the mechanistic link between extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and increased risk of breast tumour initiation remains unclear. In particular. how increased ECM stiffness might promote genomic damage. leading to the acquisition of transforming mutations. remains to be determined. Here we determine that ECM stiffness induces changes in mammary epithelial cell (MEC) metabolism that drive genomic damage. Using a 3D-culture model. we demonstrate that genome-wide transcriptional changes in response to increased ECM stiffness impair the ability of MECs to remove reactive aldehyde species. resulting in greater accumulation of DNA damage in a RhoA-dependent manner.

1219249,Cellular functions of the DUBs,2012,Michael J Clague and Judy M Coulson and Sylvie Urbé,125,,2,277-286,The Company of Biologists Ltd,Ubiquitylation is a reversible post-translational modification that has emerged as a key regulator of most complex cellular processes. It may rival phosphorylation in scope and exceed it in complexity. The dynamic nature of ubiquitylation events is important for governing protein stability. maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis and controlling ubiquitin-dependent signalling pathways. The human genome encodes ~80 active deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs. also referred to as deubiquitinases). which exhibit distinct specificity profiles towards the various ubiquitin chain topologies. As a result of their ability to reverse ubiquitylation. these enzymes control a broad range of key cellular processes. In this Commentary we discuss the cellular functions of DUBs. such as their role in governing membrane traffic and protein quality control.

METHODS: DNA from 76 Caucasian patients with SLE and 119 controls as genotyped for 3 defined dimorphic polymorphisms (G or A at position-1082. C or T at position-819. C or A at position-592) in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene. using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the IL-10 gene promoter and oligonucleotide probes specific for each allelic sequence. The frequency of genotypes was compared between patients with SLE and controls. and between clinical subsets of patients with the disease. RESULTS: There was no significant change in the allele frequency of the three IL-10 gene promoter dimorphic polymorphisms in the SLE group compared with controls. However. when subgrouped according to autoantibody status and clinical features. IL-10-1082* G.-819* C. and-592* C alleles were increased in patients possessing Ro autoantibodies and those with renal involvement. These alleles are in preferential allelic association. namely GCC.

METHODS: Criteria for recruitment to the study were fulfillment of the 1958 American Rheumatism Association criteria. absence of erosive disease at presentation and duration of symptoms less than 3 years. Radiographs of hands and feet at 0. 1. 2. 5. and 8 years were available on 114 patients and were scored by Sharp's method for erosion (ERO) and joint space narrowing (JSN). Eighty-six patients were typed for the RA susceptibility shared HLA-DR epitope. RESULTS: The feet showed greatest initial radiological progression. but tended to reach an earlier and lower plateau. ERO progressed more rapidly than JSN in the first 2 years. but in parallel thereafter. The relative proportion of ERO: JSN varied. 1: 1 for the wrists. 4: 1 for the proximal interphalangeal joints. Thirty-eight percent of joints were eroded at 2 years. 63% at 8 years. Four patterns of radiological progression were identified: flat or nonerosive disease in 29 patients. linear in 51. lag in 13. and plateau in 19 (irregular in 2). Changes in the rate of radiological progression were reflected by the time-integrated C-reactive protein over the same period. Rheumatoid factor titer was higher in the progressive groups compared to the flat group (p= 0.01).

Only a minority of karyotypically normal cells divided after plating. and these were mainly cells in the later stages of cell cycle at the time of plating. Furthermore. the daughter cells showed a continued pattern of cell death after division. so that few formed long-term proliferating colonies. These colony-forming cells showed distinct patterns of cell movement. Increasing cell density enhanced cell movement facilitating cell:cell contact. which resulted in increased proportion of dividing cells and improved survival postplating of normal hESCs. In contrast. most of the karyotypically abnormal cells reentered the cell cycle on plating and gave rise to healthy progeny. without the need for …,True,l5c4xxgAAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC,69,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671114001477,8569864647134639183,/scholar?cites=8569864647134639183,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213671114001477,0,0,0

One possibility is that the environment and the differentiation cues to which the cells are exposed are not uniform. An alternative. but not mutually exclusive possibility is that the observed heterogeneity arises from the stem cells themselves through the existence of different interconvertible substates that pre-exist before the cells commit to differentiate. We have tested this hypothesis in the case of apparently homogeneous pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells. which do not follow a uniform pattern of differentiation when exposed to retinoic acid. Instead. they produce differentiated progeny that include both neuronal and non-neural phenotypes.

Early studies suggested that generation of superoxide as a by-product of mitochondrial oxygen consumption was the major source of muscle ROS generation and that the species produced were inevitably damaging to muscle. but recent data argue against both of these possibilities. Developments in analytical approaches have shown that specific ROS are generated in a controlled manner by skeletal muscle fibers in response to physiological stimuli and play important roles in the physiological adaptations of muscle to contractions. These include optimization of contractile performance and initiation of key adaptive changes in gene expression to the stresses of contractions.

Males should therefore tailor the production of different ejaculate components according to their social environment. with particular sensitivity to cues of sperm competition risk (i.e. how likely it is that females will mate promiscuously). Here we test this hypothesis using an established vertebrate model system. the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus). combining experimental data with a quantitative proteomics analysis of seminal fluid composition. Our study tests for the first time how both sperm and seminal fluid components of the ejaculate are tailored to the social environment.

However. limited sperm supplies mean that male sexual restraint might sometimes be favored under promiscuous mating. Here. we demonstrate dynamic plasticity in male mating effort when females are encountered sequentially under varying sperm competition risk. Rather than showing consistent eagerness to mate. male house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) instead tailor their mating effort according to likely reproductive payoffs. They are significantly less likely to mate when sperm competition is certain and potential reproductive payoffs low. but dramatically increase investment if they do choose to mate under such circumstances.

An obvious way to increase sperm production is to increase testis size. and most empirical work has focussed on this parameter. Adaptive plasticity in sperm production rate could also arise due to variation in the speed with which each spermatozoon is produced. but whether animals can respond to relevant environmental conditions by modulating the kinetics of spermatogenesis in this way has not been experimentally investigated. Here we demonstrate that the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano exhibits substantial plasticity in the speed of spermatogenesis. depending on the social context: worms raised under higher levels of sperm competition produce sperm faster.

Since they are sessile or only weakly mobile. adults can interact only to a limited extent with other adults and with their own fertilized offspring. They are consequently subject mainly to selection on gamete production and gamete success. and so high gonad expenditure is expected in both sexes.

Goldfish acclimated either to 5~ or to 25~ were transferred to the opposite temperature and the changes in behavioral resistance to high temperature. the fluidity and fatty acid composition of isolated synaptosomal membranes were followed during acclimation to the new temperature with the purpose of establishing some correlation. 2. In 25~ goldfish. hyperexcitability was induced at 34.5~ loss of equilibrium at 37.6~ and coma at 39.0 In 5~ goldfish the corresponding temperatures were 29.2~ 32.0 and 33.0 Time to attain 75% of the final acclimated state after transfer was approximately 4 days at 25~ and 28 days at 5~3. Fluidity of synaptosomal membranes isolated from goldfish brains was estimated by use of the fluorescence polarization technique. Membrane viscosity decreased during acclimation to 5~ but increased during acclimation to 25~ The early stages of the transitions differed in time course from behavioral resistance acclimation but times to reach the new acclimated state were similar.,True,tiWDRFgAAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC,190,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Cossins/publication/225239216_Correlations_between_behavioral_temperature_adaptations_of_goldfish_and_viscosity_and_fatty-acid_composition_of_their_synaptic-membranes/links/54d12ff90cf25ba0f040cfe5/Correlations-between-behavioral-temperature-adaptations-of-goldfish-and-viscosity-and-fatty-acid-composition-of-their-synaptic-membranes.pdf,3168417337931277448,/scholar?cites=3168417337931277448,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Cossins/publication/225239216_Correlations_between_behavioral_temperature_adaptations_of_goldfish_and_viscosity_and_fatty-acid_composition_of_their_synaptic-membranes/links/54d12ff90cf25ba0f040cfe5/Correlations-between-behavioral-temperature-adaptations-of-goldfish-and-viscosity-and-fatty-acid-composition-of-their-synaptic-membranes.pdf,0,0,0

The attachment of the gold nanoparticles is achieved by standard avidin−biotin chemistry. The detection principle is resonance light scattering. Highly selective recognition of standard proteins (proteins A and G) down to 1 pg/mL for proteins in solution and 10 fg for proteins on the microarray spots is demonstrated. Enzyme activity of the kinase (PKA) is detected with high specificity down to a limit of 1 fg for an established peptide substrate (kemptide) on the microarray spots.

This process was inhibited by amiloride (K½10−4moll−1) and by the removal of extracellular Na+. The rate of acidification was a saturable function of extracellular Na+ concentration.When extracellular pH was maintained constant by continual titration with KOH. adrenalin induced a transient burst of H+ efflux. During this period the loss of cellular H+ equivalents was approximately equal to the net gain of Na+. providing evidence for a Na+/H+ exchange with a stoichiometry of 1. The steady state following stimulation with adrenalin could be disturbed by changes in extracellular pH.

The regulatory volume decrease (RVD) was not complete after 1 h. 2. During RVD the cells lost K+ and Cl‐ but gained Na+. This entry of Na+. which is about half the K+ loss. explains the incomplete volume recovery (it was complete when Na+ was replaced by impermeant N‐methyl‐D‐glucamine). The cells also lose large quantities of taurine. which accounts for about 53% of the volume recovery. In addition RVD is accompanied by the activation of a pathway allowing some large organic cations which are normally impermeant. such as choline or tetramethyl‐ammonium. to rapidly penetrate the cells. 3.

However. over the last decades. there have been numerous fatalities. mainly caused by accidental or voluntary ingestion. PQ poisoning is an extremely frustrating condition to manage clinically. due to the elevated morbidity and mortality observed so far and due to the lack of effective treatments to be used in humans. PQ mainly accumulates in the lung (pulmonary concentrations can be 6 to 10 times higher than those in the plasma). where it is retained even when blood levels start to decrease. The pulmonary effects can be explained by the participation of the polyamine transport system abundantly expressed in the membrane of alveolar cells type I. II. and Clara cells.

The role of genetic predisposition in PD has been increasingly acknowledged and a number of relevant genes have been identified (e.g.. genes encoding α-synuclein. parkin. and dardarin). while the search for environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis of PD has only recently begun to escalate. In recent years. the investigation on paraquat (PQ) toxicity has suggested that this herbicide might be an environmental factor contributing to this neurodegenerative disorder.

This interaction is an important factor in relation to their bioavailability and is considered the basis of several important properties of tannins. namely. the development of astringency.

1219469,Muscular atrophy following immobilisation,1990,Hans-Joachim Appell,10,,1,42-58,Springer International Publishing,Muscular atrophy regularly occurs as a consequence of immobilisation or disuse after sports injuries. Several experimental models deal with muscle atrophy and are suitable for investigations of the underlying mechanisms of muscle atrophy. Strength loss is the most evident response to atrophy. Muscle strength decreases most dramatically during the first week of immobilisation; little further weakening occurs later on. This is reflected in changes in the EMG of disused muscles and can also be observed in muscle weight and size of muscle fibres. Slow muscles with predominantly oxidative metabolism are most susceptible to atrophy as indicated by various findings: slow muscle fibres show greater atrophy than fast fibres; their relative and probably absolute number is decreased in atrophic muscles; in addition. the oxidative enzyme content is most severely affected by disuse.

Strain injuries are the most common muscle injuries after contusions. These injuries can lead to significant pain and disability causing time to be lost to training and competition. Despite the frequency of strain injuries the treatment available is limited and is generally not sufficient to enhance muscle regeneration efficiently when fast resumption of sport activity is a primary target. A number of growth factors play a specific role in regeneration and it has been proven that a previously described method of physically and chemically stimulating whole blood (to produce autologous conditioned serum) induces concentration increases in FGF-2. HGF. and TGF-β1. A preliminary study was conducted on muscle strain injuries in professional sportsmen receiving either: 1. autologous conditioned serum (ACS) or 2. Actovegin/Traumeel treatment as control. Assessment of recovery from injury was done by: 1. sport professional s ability to participate to 100% under competition conditions in their respective sport and 2. MRI analysis. A significant difference in the recovery time from injury was demonstrated: 16.6 0.9 in the ACS treated instead of 22.3 1.2 (mean SEM) days in the Actovegin/Traumeel control group (p= 0.001). MRI analysis supported the observed acceleration of the lesion recovery time.

For fatigue due to prolonged exercise. hypoxic conditions and the formation of free oxygen radicals seem to be of aetiological importance. resulting in an elevated lysosomal activity. Eccentric exercise of high intensity rather results in a mechanical stress to the fibres. Although these different mechanisms can be discerned experimentally. both result in similar impairments of muscle function. A good training status may attenuate the clinical signs of fatigue and muscle damage. The symptoms and events occurring during delayed onset of muscle soreness (DOMS) can be explained by a cascade of events following structural damage to muscle proteins.,True,XNNehYgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,247,https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-199213020-00006,12700328445424749985,/scholar?cites=12700328445424749985,,,0,0,0

New York. Thieme.,Muscle contusions represent a major part of sports injuries. The suggested treatments are generally sufficient to support muscle healing. but require a relatively long period of time. Given that autologous blood products are safe treatments. we have used a technique which stimulates the release of certain growth factors in the autologous conditioned serum (ACS). Those growth factors are known to improve the proliferative activity of myogenic precursor cells. Mice were subjected to an experimental contusion injury to their gastrocnemius muscle; one group received local injections of ACS at 2 hrs. 24 hrs. and 48 hrs after injury. a control group received saline injections. The histology results showed that satellite cell activation at 30/48 hrs post injury was accelerated and the diameter of the regenerating myofibers was increased compared to the controls within the first week after injury. ELISA results on the ACS have shown that the elevations in FGF-2 (460%) and TGF-β1 (82%) could be partly responsible for the accelerating effects on regeneration due to proliferative and chemotactic properties. We conclude that ACS injection is a promising approach to reduce the time of recovery from muscle injury.

Sports Med. 14 (1993) 440—443 Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York (1) represent evidently similarities (11). which may suggest the involvement of similar if not same physiopathological mechanisms of those two experimental conditions.It has been shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are vastly formed in muscle under conditions of strenu-ous exercise (16. 23. 30) as well as after ischemia/reperfusion (7. 17. 26). These ROS generally have a toxic action on tissues (8) and they can be liberated by endothelial cells (12. 15. 28). In this case. xanthine oxidase (XO) existing in vivo predominantly as an NAD dependent dehydrogenase (13. 29) in the capillary endothelium is functionally altered under certain conditions: proteolysis. increase of temperature. anaerobiosis. oxidation of thiol groups (22. 27). Many such conditions exist as well during/after exercise as during ischemia/reperfusion. The functional alterations of XO under such circumstances consist of a utilization of oxygen as an electron receptor thereby transforming XO into an oxygen-dependent oxidase (12. 15. 18). In this situation. the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) oxidizes proportionally to the ROS concentration (16. 21. 23) and its depletion can be used as a marker for oxidative stress.,True,XNNehYgAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,145,https://www.academia.edu/download/48333718/Endothelium-Derived_Oxidative_Stress_May20160826-20242-1rocl0y.pdf,818065848799418865,/scholar?cites=818065848799418865,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48333718/Endothelium-Derived_Oxidative_Stress_May20160826-20242-1rocl0y.pdf,0,0,0

1219479,The role of mitochondria in aging of skeletal muscle,2008,Pedro Alexandre Figueiredo and Maria P Mota and Hans Joachim Appell and José Alberto Duarte,9,,2,67-84,Springer Netherlands,Aging can be characterized as a time dependent decline of maximal functionality that affects tissues and organs of the whole body. Such is induced by the progressive loss of redundant components and leads to an increased susceptibility to disease and risk of death. Regarding the aging of skeletal muscle. it has been pointed out that mitochondria is a key factor behind the loss of redundancy and functionality. since this organelle has a major role in cellular homeostasis particularly at the level of the bioenergetic status. Decreased activities of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and an increased release of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria are well documented with age; it is suggested that the mitochondrial loss of function results from the increased oxidative damage to proteins. lipids. and DNA of this organelle.

No 4. pp 256—260. 1987.The effects of two methods of electrical stimulation on maximum isometric force. calf girth. and skinfold thick-ness of stimulated and nonstimulated (contralateral) legs were studied. Thirty-six male volunteers. divided into three groups. participated in the experiment. Groups I and II were subjected to the procedure of electrical stimulation of m. triceps surae daily for a period of 21 days. Group I was stimulated by an alternating current of low frequency (50 Hz); group II was also stimulated by an alternating current but of higher frequency (2000 Hz). Group Ill served as control group. In groups I and II significant increases of the maximum isometric force (as measured on an electronic dynamometer) of the stimulated (50.3% and 58.8%) and also of the nonstimulated (contralateral) mus-cles (39.7% and 32. 2%) were found.

Although it is established that these mitochondrial subpopulations differ functionally in several ways. limited information exists about the proteomic differences underlying these functional differences. Therefore. the objective of this study was to biochemically characterize the SS and IMF mitochondria isolated from rat red gastrocnemius skeletal muscle. We separated the two mitochondrial subpopulations from skeletal muscle using a refined method that provides an excellent division of these unique mitochondrial subpopulations.

Since glucose uptake during muscle contraction has been observed in the absence of insulin. the existence of an insulin-independent pathway has been suggested to explain this phenomenon. However. the exact mechanism behind the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles through the sarcolemma during muscle contraction is still unknown. Some substances. such as AMPK and calcium activated proteins. have been suggested as potential mediators but the exact mechanisms of their involvement remain to be elucidated.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The anatomical relationships of the greater occipital nerve (GON) to the semispinalis capitis muscle (SCM) and the trapezius muscle aponeurosis (TMA) were examined to identify topographic landmarks for use in anesthetic blockade of the GON in occipital neuralgia. The course and the diameter of the GON were studied in 40 cadavers (29 females. 11 males). and the points where it pierced the SCM and the TMA were identified. The course of the GON did not differ between males and females. A left–right difference was detected in the site of the GON in the TMA region but not in the SCM region. The nerve became wider towards the periphery. This may be relevant to entrapment of the nerve in the development of occipital neuralgia.

Muscular strength is one of the most important compo-nents of sport. both for high performance and for injury prevention. One of the most used methods to assess strength muscle balance between dominant (D)/non-dominant (ND) and antagonist/agonist is isokinetic testing. The main purpose of the present study was to describe and to compare isokinetic strength profiles (peak torque. bilateral strength differences between D/ND leg (BD) and hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratio) in athletes of different sports and positional roles.Methods. Twenty-eight elite volleyball players and 47 pro soccer players (goalkeepers. n= 5; full-backs. n= 7; defenders. n= 10; midfielders. n= 15; forwards. n= 10) were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex-System 2). Maximal gravity corrected concentric peak torque of knee extensor and flexor muscles were measured at angular velocities of 360. s-1 (6.28 rad• s-1) and 90. s-1 (1.57 rad. s-1).Results. No significant BD were found between soccer and vol-leyball players with exception of hamstrings at 90. s-1 (soccer: 10.6±8.0% vs volleyball: 6.9±5.5%). The H/Q ratio was significantly lower in volleyball players at 90. s-1 (D: soccer 57.4±6.7% vs volleyball 50.4±7.2%; ND: soccer: 56.1±8.2% vs volleyball: 50.5±6.4%). No significant differences were found for BD and H/Q ratio in soccer players of different positional roles.Conclusion. In general. soccer and volleyball players do not seem to be different concerning BD although a significant difference was observed in hamstrings at 90. s-1.

1219499,Aging effects on joint proprioception: the role of physical activity in proprioception preservation,2007,Fernando Ribeiro and José Oliveira,4,,2,71-76,BioMed Central,Throughout the human life span the functions of several physiological systems dramatically change. including proprioception. Impaired proprioception leads to less accurate detection of body position changes increasing the risk of fall. and to abnormal joint biomechanics during functional activities so. over a period of time. degenerative joint disease may result. Altered neuromuscular control of the lower limb and consequently poor balance resulting from changes in the proprioceptive function could be related to the high incidence of harmful falls that occur in old age subjects. There is evidence of proprioception deterioration with aging. Regular physical activity seems to be a beneficial strategy to preserve proprioception and prevent falls among older subjects. Some studies have demonstrated that the regular physical activity can attenuate age-related decline in proprioception. This paper reviews the evidence of age effects on joint proprioception. We will discuss the possible mechanisms behind these effects and the role of regular physical activity in the attenuation of age-related decline in proprioception.,True,Nk1SiuoAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC,194,https://eurapa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s11556-007-0026-x,5256523758784825198,/scholar?cites=5256523758784825198,,https://eurapa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1007/s11556-007-0026-x,0,0,0

1219512,O treino dos jovens desportistas. Actualização de alguns temas que fazem a agenda do debate sobre a preparação dos mais jovens,2001,Antonio Marques and José Oliveira,,,,,,INTRODUÇÃO Os sistemas de treino e de competições dos mais jovens carecem de um maior aprofundamento. Os modelos explicativos existentes. desenvolvidos ao longo dos últimos quarenta anos. apoiam-se ainda muito na experiência e no conhecimento empírico. em orientações pedagógicas e normativas. e menos do que seria desejável na explicação científica (23. 24. 27. 28. 29). A necessidade de qualificação da prática durante os anos de formação desportiva tem estimulado a reflexão e o debate dos especialistas de forma mais intensa nos últimos quinze anos. Desse debate. destacaríamos quatro pontos principais: a natureza dos exercícios de treino (2. 28. 29. 32. 38. 48. 49). a estrutura e a dinâmica da carga (26. 30. 32). o desenvolvimento das capacidades motoras (3. 17. 20) e o sistema de competições. Deste último não falaremos aqui. remetendo os interessados para alguns ensaios e estudos em que é tratado (1. 25. 41. 46).OS EXERCÍCIOS DE TREINO A Teoria dos Sistemas Funcionais de Anochin (cf. 48) remete para a necessidade de uma grande frequência e especificidade contextual de estímulos e feed-backs. A Teoria da Adaptação condiciona as possibilidades de adaptação do organismo às chamadas “reservas de adaptação”. Estes pressupostos determinariam que o espectro de factores a treinar estivesse limitado às exigências mais relevantes da estrutura do rendimento num determinado desporto. A não ser assim (Boiko. 1987. citado em 49) as possibilidades de adaptação do organismo diminuiriam perante o aumento do número de factores aos quais este se deveria adaptar.

The inflammatory system has an important role in muscle injury and repair. Serum creatine kinase (CK) is often used as systemic biomarker representing muscle damage. Considerable variation exists in CK response between different subjects. Genetic elements may act as predisposition factors for exertional srhabdomyolysis. Based on their biological activity. we hypothesized that in healthy subjects IL6 G-174C and TNFA G-308A promoter polymorphisms would be associated with CK response to exercise. We determined serum CK activity pre- and post-maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles.

In response to various aggressive stimuli. the endothelial cell modulates its properties to restore vascular homeostasis. Usually. changes in the endothelial cell phenotype are transient and do not compromise the subsequent re-establishment of endothelial function. However. in certain pathological conditions. such as atherosclerosis. endothelial function is chronically disturbed. and this alteration is a critical step in the progression of the disease. In recent years. advances in knowledge have improved our understanding of the physiopathology of atherosclerosis. which is now known to be a dynamic and progressive process proceeding from endothelial dysfunction and inflammation of the vascular wall. The evolution and prognosis of atherosclerosis. along with the efficacy of therapeutic modalities. can be assessed by measuring the circulating levels of various biomarkers expressed or released by the endothelium.

The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men. who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5–22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3–19.7) taller. respectively. In contrast. there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century. whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm. and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8–144.8).

Vol. 44. No. 3. pp. 466–473. 2012. Purpose: Physical activity has many health benefits. and to implement strategies. mainly in those groups with insufficient levels of practice. it is important to evaluate physical activity. The main purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of physical activity in the Portuguese population aged 10 yr and older using accelerometry. Methods: The accelerometers were worn for four consecutive days. and a valid record was defined as at least 3 d with 10 h of wear time. including one weekend day. Considering these conditions. 4696 participants were included. Results: According to the recommendations of 60 minIdj1 of physical activity. 36% of participants age 10–11 yr (boys= 51.6%. girls= 22.5%) and 4% age 16–17 yr (boys= 7.9%. girls= 1.2%) were considered sufficiently active. In adulthood. È70% of participants age 18–64 yr (men=76.6%. women= 65.2%) and 35% age older than 64 yr (men= 46%. women= 29%) reached the recommendation of 30 minIdj1 of physical activity. when counting every minute of moderate or greater intensity. Considering bouts of 10 min or more of moderate or greater intensity in participants older than 17 yr. the prevalence was 4%–6% at 18–39 yr. 7%–9% at 40–64 yr. and È3% in persons age 65 yr or older.

However. over the last decades. there have been numerous fatalities. mainly caused by accidental or voluntary ingestion. PQ poisoning is an extremely frustrating condition to manage clinically. due to the elevated morbidity and mortality observed so far and due to the lack of effective treatments to be used in humans. PQ mainly accumulates in the lung (pulmonary concentrations can be 6 to 10 times higher than those in the plasma). where it is retained even when blood levels start to decrease. The pulmonary effects can be explained by the participation of the polyamine transport system abundantly expressed in the membrane of alveolar cells type I. II. and Clara cells.

Epidemiologic studies indicate that exposure to pesticides can be a risk factor in the incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). A strong correlation has been reported between exposure to paraquat and PD incidence in Canada. Taiwan. and the United States. This correlation is supported by animal studies showing that paraquat produces toxicity in dopaminergic neurons of the rat and mouse brain. However. it is unclear how paraquat triggers toxicity in dopaminergic neurons. Based on the prooxidant properties of paraquat. it was hypothesized that paraquat may induce oxidative stress-mediated toxicity in dopaminergic neurons. To explore this possibility. dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells were treated with paraquat. and several biomarkers of oxidativestress were measured.

1219556,Profiling of RNA degradation for estimation of post morterm interval,2013,Fernanda Sampaio-Silva and Teresa Magalhães and Félix Carvalho and Ricardo Jorge Dinis-Oliveira and Ricardo Silvestre,8,PloS one,2,e56507,Public Library of Science,An estimation of the post mortem interval (PMI) is frequently touted as the Holy Grail of forensic pathology. During the first hours after death. PMI estimation is dependent on the rate of physical observable modifications including algor. rigor and livor mortis. However. these assessment methods are still largely unreliable and inaccurate. Alternatively. RNA has been put forward as a valuable tool in forensic pathology. namely to identify body fluids. estimate the age of biological stains and to study the mechanism of death. Nevertheless. the attempts to find correlation between RNA degradation and PMI have been unsuccessful. The aim of this study was to characterize the RNA degradation in different post mortem tissues in order to develop a mathematical model that can be used as coadjuvant method for a more accurate PMI determination. For this purpose. we performed an eleven-hour kinetic analysis of total extracted RNA from murine's visceral and muscle tissues. The degradation profile of total RNA and the expression levels of several reference genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. A quantitative analysis of normalized transcript levels on the former tissues allowed the identification of four quadriceps muscle genes (Actb. Gapdh.

This interaction is an important factor in relation to their bioavailability and is considered the basis of several important properties of tannins. namely. the development of astringency. It has been generally accepted that astringency is due to the tannin-induced complexation and/or precipitation of salivary proline-rich proteins (PRPs) in the oral cavity. However. this complexation is thought to provide protection against dietary tannins. Neverthless. there is no concrete evidence and agreement about which PRP families (acidic. basic. and glycosylated) are responsible for the interaction with condensed tannins.

We report here that 75% of the high-grade bladder tumours. presenting elevated proliferation rates and high risk of recurrence/progression expressed STn. However. it was mainly found in non-proliferative areas of the tumour. namely in cells invading the basal and muscle layers. STn was also found in tumour-adjacent mucosa. which suggests its dependence on a field effect of the tumour. Furthermore. it was not expressed by the normal urothelium. demonstrating the cancer-specific nature of this antigen. STn expression correlated with that of sialyltransferase ST6GalNAc.I. its major biosynthetic enzyme. The stable expression of ST6GalNAc.I in the bladder cancer cell line MCR induced STn expression and a concomitant increase of cell motility and invasive capability. Altogether. these results indicate …,True,9P8sK94AAAAJ:hNFvT5Kh_mEC,75,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574789113000458,7979101251112285728,/scholar?cites=7979101251112285728,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574789113000458,0,0,0

Additionally. a new methodology. based on protection of the lectins with their target sugars prior to coupling with MNPs. was proposed to overcome the nonspecific nature of conjugation. This approach contributed to preserve lectin conformation. increasing by 40% and 90% the affinity of ConA and MA for glycoproteins in relation to synthesis with nonprotected lectins. Optimal operating conditions (temperature. time) and maximum binding capacities were further determined for each lectin by use of fetuin as a reference.

Ltd.,Albumin is an important plasma antioxidant protein. contributing to protecting mechanisms of cellular and regulatory long‐lived proteins. The metal‐catalyzed oxidation (MCO) of proteins plays an important role during oxidative stress. In this study. we examine the oxidative modification of albumin using an MCO in vitro system. Mass spectrometry. combined with off‐line nano‐liquid chromatography. was used to identify modifications in amino acid residues. We have found 106 different residues oxidatively damaged. being the main oxidized residues lysines. cysteines. arginines. prolines. histidines and tyrosines. Besides protein hydroxyl derivatives and oxygen additions. we detected other modifications such as deamidations. carbamylations and specific amino acid oxidative modifications.
