Bringing familiar resources/organisms to new lands allowed humans to thrive in areas with few recognizable nutritional sources. and allowed establishment of familiar surroundings in unfamiliar locations. It is not only our ability to adapt to new environments but also the ability to adapt environments to our requirements that has made us successful as a species. At the same time. human dispersal and movement of organisms have introduced nuisance species to new environments and enabled parasites and pathogens to follow us and encounter new potential hosts (Araujo et al. 2008).As technological advances allowing farther and faster travel increase the connectedness of human populations. species introductions have also increased. For a species to become invasive. it must 1) be introduced to a new range. 2) establish itself. and 3) have the physiological and/or ecological propensity to cause a negative impact (Clinton 1999). Williamson’s (1996)“tens” rule posits that~ 10% of species will make it through each of these three transitions on the path to invasiveness. although other studies suggest 1,True,BYLnheMAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=kent1384952870,,,,https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=kent1384952870&disposition=inline,0,0,0

1088647,Genetic Distance as a Function of Geographic Distance in Ohio Dusky Salamanders,2005,Lisa Regula Meyer,,,,,,Evolution typically begins as geographic separation. leading to genetic isolation. or speciation. 'Island examples' of geographic isolation are common. but situations less severe lead to evolution. Mobility and degree of ubiquity influence geographic separation. Northern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus fuscus) are neither mobile nor widespread. They remain within metres of streams because of moisture needs due to cutaneous respiration. Considering this. small amounts of geographic separation might drive evolution. The purpose of this study is to investigate the degree of genetic similarity between two populations of dusky salamander in Ohio. We expect greater differences between the sites. given their degree of geographic separation. than we do within the sites. We collected DNA from dusky salamanders in two Ohio locations. Analysis included veiwing of rehybridized DNA. and fragment length matching. We found small but significant genetic differences between the two populations.,True,BYLnheMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/470,,,,https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/handle/1811/470/srthesis.pdf?..,0,0,0

It because the distance of user is far from System of monitoring dan controlling quality of water. By using Wireless Communication. user can monitored and controlled the quality of water in the other place. We use Video Channel from video sender to applicate the wireless communication system. We choose video channel because it has wider bandwith than audio channel. The success of the wireless communication system depends on the success of transmitting date from microcontroller that be placed in the transmitter side of the video sender to microcontroller that be placed in the receiver side of the video sender. If the transmitting signal from the input side of the the transmitter side of the video sender is similar with the receiving signal from the output of receiver side of the video sender. The transmitting date and the receiving date from the microcontroller are displayed at. In order to display the microcontroller dates in laptop monitor. we need USB to TTL Serial The Converter Cable. Because of the signal shape is random. we use crosscorellation formula to analyze the caracteristic of the communication channel. Crosscorellation can determine the degree of simirality of transmitting signal and the receiving signal. From the success of microcontroller transmitting date and crosscorellation computation from the communication signal. we can get the best communication bit rate is 38400 bps.,True,a6mAIwEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,http://repository.akprind.ac.id/sites/files/C57-62Pius.pdf,3920235974949015575,/scholar?cites=3920235974949015575,,http://repository.akprind.ac.id/sites/files/C57-62Pius.pdf,0,0,0

L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium contained in Biokul plain yoghurt with the addition of katuk leaves in 3 concentrations formulas. ie 1 gram. 2 grams and 3 grams. Katuk leaves yoghurt of each formula were made with 3 replications. and then were compared to control (yogurt without katuk leaves addition) organolepticly by five panelists. Data then was statistically analyzed using Kruskal Wallis Test and supported by qualitative analysis. Results indicated that each formula and control showed little differences in terms of color. aroma. flavor and texture. but the differences were not statistically significant. It was therefore concluded that the addition of katuk leaves up to 3 g in 100 ml UHT milk does not affect the characteristis of produced yoghurt and still relatively the same as ordinary yoghurt.,True,a6mAIwEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,http://seminar.uny.ac.id/icriems/sites/seminar.uny.ac.id.icriems/files/prosiding/B-08.pdf,,,,http://seminar.uny.ac.id/icriems/sites/seminar.uny.ac.id.icriems/files/prosiding/B-08.pdf,0,0,0

It is shown that their accumulation intensity in pollen sacs increases in proportion to the dose and reaches its maximum in the P 32 variant after using a 8.0 MBq/ml dose. The migration intensity was the lowest in the 2.0 MBq/ml variant (0.14-0.223 MBq/100 mg). It is estimated that P 32 and S 35 have significantly affected the vitality of tea plant pollens through the anomalies of their development. After using 2.0 and 4.0 MBq/ml doses. the vitality of the pollen is reduced in proportion to the dose and the development anomalies increase. Particulalry. the viability of pollen decrease compared to the control group. but the frequency and range of development anomalies increases. These include the slow development of the plant or the acceleration of the development of the primary nucleus. polyspermia. undeveloped pollen tube. etc. The use of processed P 32 and S 35 tea pollens in hybridization significantly increases the frequency of new formations and results in variability in the domination of signs.

In all experiments. the studied organisms were incubated in different chlorophyllin concentrations in the dark. and then exposed to sunlight to stimulate the lethal photosensitizing action of chlorophyllin. Snails lethal concentrations for six hours of sunlight exposure were as follows: LC90 (131.86 ppm). LC50 (82.68 ppm). LC25 (56.93 ppm) and LC10 (33.76 ppm). The lethal action of chlorophyllin is affected by several factors including: light source. duration of sunlight exposure. the developmental stage of the snails and the presence of infection. On the cellular level. histological sections revealed marked destruction of certain tissues with loss of their landmarks. Chlorophyllin also had a profound lethal effect on the larval stages of Schistosoma mansoni.

Two thirds of the world’s population live in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. Asia. and Latin America. Many of these people live in absolute poverty and are vulnerable to dozens of diseases. Tropical health problems constitute a huge burden on developing countries. hindering socio-economic development. reducing life quality. impairing physical and cognitive development. causing adverse pregnancy outcomes. and limiting adult productivity within the workforce. This burden is even heavier in poorly resourced communities. In light of this situation. and as stated in Sustainable Development Goals. the World Health Organization is committed to eradicating the epidemics of AIDS. tuberculosis. malaria. and various neglected tropical diseases and combating hepatitis. water-borne diseases. and other communicable diseases by 2030.Tropical health encompasses a diverse group of issues related to infectious diseases (viral. bacterial. parasitic. and fungal infections). non-communicable diseases. and malnutrition and its consequences. Whereas some of these issues are being properly tackled. others continue to be neglected. On a global scale. Africa. the Eastern Mediterranean region. and Southeast Asia are reported to be the most heavily disease burdened regions. where approximately 50% of all deaths are caused by infectious diseases.

Hassan & Hawazin A …,2016,Abdullah A Hassan,16,Tikrit Journal for Agricultural Sciences,4,,Tikrit University,Phytate (myo-inositol hexakisphosphate) is the predominant form of storage of phosphorus in cereals. oilseeds and vegetables which are the major ingredients of animal feed (Reddy et al.. 1982; Wodzinski and Ullah. 1996). Monogastric animals such as swine. poultry and fish are unable to utilize phytate due to the low levels of phytate-degrading enzyme activity in their digestive tracts and inorganic phosphate is added to the feed for the purpose of phosphorous supplementation (Bitar and Reinhold. 1972; Common. 1989). Hence non-metabolized phytate and unabsorbed phosphate pass through the intestinal tract and are excreted in manure causing phosphorous eutrophication. Furthermore. phytate also acts as an antinutritional factor in monogastric animals by chelating proteins and various metal ions needed by the animal. such as calcium. copper. zinc… etc. therefore decreasing the dietary availability of these nutrients (Applegate et al.. 2003; Bohn et al.. 2008; Veum et al.. 2006). Phytase (myo-inositol hexaphosphate phosphohydrolase. EC 3.1. 3.8 or EC 3.1. 3.2. 6) hydrolyzes phytate. thereby releasing inorganic phosphate (Liu et al.. 1998; Wodzinski and Ullah. 1996). Supplemental microbial phytase in meal diets for swine. poultry and fish effectively improves phytate phosphorus utilization by these animals. The phytases enhances the bioavailibility of minerals. protein and phosphorus in monogastric animals decreasing minerals excretion pollution (Augspurger et al.. 2003; Rutherfurd etal.. 2002; Olukosi et al.. 2007).

In this retrospective. we assess the knowledge gained from. but also the limitations of. older studies on bat homing and review the advances in our understanding of homing and navigation in bats. Although we have learned much over the last half-century about the orientation and navigational abilities of bats. particularly our understanding of cues and spatial orientation. we still do not know if bats are capable of true navigation nor how they learn to do so.

Several recent studies have predicted continental-scale declines of hoary bat populations due to interactions with wind turbines. We predicted a decrease in captures at a summer site over 20 years where researchers have captured bats using generally consistent methods. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the relative change in the expected number of captures while controlling for time of year. temperature. and netting effort. We found no decrease in the number of captures for either species.

As armadillos move into more-temperate climates. behavioral adjustments occur in response to decreasing temperatures. Observations in northern latitudes have noted more activity during the daytime in the winter. indicating a shift in circadian rhythm. Such behavioral plasticity may allow individuals to forage when temperatures are optimal for thermoregulation. We recorded armadillo activity for 6 mo using game cameras.

This method is minimally invasive and has been successfully used to yield useful dietary information in closely related snakes (Daltry et al.. 1996; Williams et al.. 2016). To extract faecal samples. individual Galapagos racers were held firmly in one hand around the mid-body. Gentle pressure was then applied slowly to palpate the intestinal tract. three quarters of the way down the body until faecal matter was extruded. Due to the delicate nature of this procedure. training in the field was provided by JC Daltry (see also Daltry et al. 1995; Williams et al.. 2016). Faecal samples were collected in 2 ml micro-centrifuge tubes and fixed in 0.5-1.5 ml of 96% ethanol until examination for contents. An alternative method to identify prey items is forced regurgitation (Drummond and Garcia. 1989; Manjarrez et al.. 2013). but this method is more invasive and requires finding snakes in the process of ingesting or recently ingested prey. which only applied to 7% of our encounters with racers on the Galapagos Islands.

Philippines,,Jacqueline V Bagunu and Virgilio dM Gonzales and Evelyn V Totaan and Myer G Mula and Noel C Surban and Manuelito Mallari and Stephen V Miclat,,,,,,The Golden Apple Snail (GAS). Pomacea canaliculata Lamarck. was once introduced to increase the protein source of Filipino diets. But has now become invasive and a major pest in direct-seeded rice. devouring rice seedlings during the first 30 days of its life cycle. Farmers usually resort to use of chemical molluscicide to combat GAS; however. this has imposed hazards to farm workers. draft animals and non-target organisms. The use of biological controls. such as Ziziphus talanai (balakat) tree in this study. therefore. is a welcome development. The application of dried balakat leaf powder at 7 kg/ha is a feasible and farmer-accepted alternative to chemical molluscicide to control GAS in direct-seeded rice areas of Pampanga. Philippines.

Yeast and Mold (YM) test. and C-metaphase chromosome analysis. Some of the practices relative to possible fruit contamination are hand picking. unsanitized container and contact to the soil during harvesting. The initial microbial count is possibly associated with unacceptable farmer’s practices during pre-harvest and harvesting process. Microbial analyses established that T3 (irradiated AST fruit at 5kGy) is the best irradiation dose to extend the shelf life of fresh tamarind fruit up to 20 days followed by T2 (irradiated AST fruit at 3kGy) that has also the capability to extend the shelf life up to 15 days. On the other hand. T1 (Irradiated AST fruit at 1 kGy) and control are comparable with each other but cannot prolong the shelf-life of tamarind fruit as compared to T3 (irradiated AST fruit at 5kGy and T2 (irradiated AST fruit at 3kGy).

1088779,Non-essential and essential metal effects on intracellular Toxoplasma gondii,2016,Laís Pessanha de Carvalho and Edésio José Tenório de Melo,3,European Journal of Biomedical,5,23-32,,Toxoplasma gondii is an obligatory protozoan parasite that uses sophisticated mechanisms to guarantee its survival at the intracellular environment of all eukaryotic host cells. However. metals are very important for survival and development of several parasites at host intracellular environment. The parasites use essential metals as co-factors or structural components of metalloproteins. These proteins are involved in host cell invasion. establishment on cytoplasm. vacuole formation. parasite multiplication and host cell egress. Nonetheless. the understanding of toxicological and biochemical impact of metallic ions on biological systems of intracellular replicative form of T. gondii-tachyzoite is poorly known. The aim of this study was utilize the relationship of host cell-Toxoplasma gondii to verify the effects of non-essential (CdCl2 and HgCl2) and essential (ZnCl2) metals on the maintenance of intracellular infection. We used different concentrations (1. 3. 5. 8. 10 and 20 µM) and incubation times (2. 12 and 24 h) to observe the progressive toxic effect to parasite. Ultrastructural features were analyzed under light and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that uninfected culture were more susceptible to toxicity of non-essential metals than infected ones. However. the infection decreased during the incubation with these metals while tachyzoites underwent elimination at low time and concentrations of the non-essential metals. These results suggest that parasites were very susceptible to these metals. Therefore. the essential metal (ZnCl2) protected the host cells and parasites against toxic effects of non-essential metals (HgCl2 and CdCl2).,True,veqDOy4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,4,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edesio_Melo2/publication/301823268_NON-ESSENTIAL_AND_ESSENTIAL_METAL_EFFECTS_ON_INTRACELLULAR_TOXOPLAS/links/5a2986890f7e9b63e5351b08/NON-ESSENTIAL-AND-ESSENTIAL-METAL-EFFECTS-ON-INTRACELLULAR-TOXOPLAS.pdf,5786962517804411505,/scholar?cites=5786962517804411505,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edesio_Melo2/publication/301823268_NON-ESSENTIAL_AND_ESSENTIAL_METAL_EFFECTS_ON_INTRACELLULAR_TOXOPLAS/links/5a2986890f7e9b63e5351b08/NON-ESSENTIAL-AND-ESSENTIAL-METAL-EFFECTS-ON-INTRACELLULAR-TOXOPLAS.pdf,0,0,0

A total of 54 rhizobial isolates authenticated to nodulate faba bean plants were evaluated for indole acetic acid (IAA) production. phosphate solubilization and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) utilization. In vitro IAA production was observed in all isolates while phosphate solubilizing and ACC utilizing activities were demonstrated only in 15% of the isolates. Isolates varied significantly for IAA production as well as phosphate solubilization. The average IAA concentration recorded for isolates ranged from 75 to 25µgml-1culture. Phosphate solubilization was more variable with solubilization index ranging from 2 to 4 on Pikovskaya’s agar medium. On the basis of auxins biosynthesis. phosphate solubilization and ACC utilization a pot experiment was conducted for evaluating 2 isolates for the growth promotion and N2 fixation of faba bean. Results showed that inoculation with rhizobial isolates having these PGP traits increased nodulation parameters (90.4% to 70.5% more nodules. 5-6 times larger nodule fresh weight/plant) than isolate lacking these traits. In addition these isolates had a positive impact on growth. N2 fixation and shoot phosphorous (P) content. The two isolates with PGP activity selected in this study increased shoot dry weight by 40-55% and significantly elevated N2 fixation potential and shoot P content compared to isolate without PGP activity.

1088814,Traditional System of Mortuary Vocal Signals in Albania,2012,Bledar Kondi,48,Zeitschrift für Balkanologie,1,60-74,Harrassowitz Verlag,One of the aims of anthropological analysis is to identify the vocal signals of a traditional communication system in a death situation. classify them according to their function in that system and define their singular. particular and universal features. Imagination of death and bereavement. its intuitive deduction and vocal-behavioural externalization as howling. wailing. screaming etc. seems to hypostatize the archetype of crying itself among various local traditions and peoples. However. a howl or a wail can serve as an archetype only when it serves as an ideal for imitation. The expressive vocalisation of affective states shows a remarkable specificity in Albanian space: ulurima (howl). kuja (wailing) in Toskëria (south) and kukatja (‘cooing’.‘outcry’). gjama (roar) in Gegëria (north) are the most emblematic and significant sonic symbols which are extracted from real and mythical sources and are functionally integrated …,True,sz_xO8YAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13173/zeitbalk.48.1.0060,7400804254298237327,/scholar?cites=7400804254298237327,,http://www.zeitschrift-fuer-balkanologie.de/index.php/zfb/article/download/292/290,0,0,0

However. mitotic exit can occur prematurely without proper chromosomal segregation or cytokinesis by a process termed mitotic slippage. It remains controversial whether mitotic slippage increases the cytotoxicity of spindle poisons or the converse. Altering the SAC induces either mitotic cell death or mitotic slippage. While knockout of MAD2-binding protein p31 comet strengthened the SAC and promoted mitotic cell death. knockout of TRIP13 had the opposite effect of triggering mitotic slippage. We demonstrated that mitotic slippage prevented mitotic cell death caused by spindle poisons. but reduced subsequent long-term survival. Weakening of the SAC also reduced cell survival in response to spindle perturbation insufficient for triggering mitotic slippage. of which mitotic exit was …,True,Ke2tULIAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-019-1539-8,17069497371133851709,/scholar?cites=17069497371133851709,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-019-1539-8,0,0,0

Although degradation of cyclin B1 during prolonged mitotic arrest is believed to trigger mitotic slippage. its upstream regulation remains obscure. Whether mitotic slippage is caused by APC/C CDC20 activity that is able to escape spindle-assembly checkpoint (SAC)-mediated inhibition. or is actively promoted by a change in SAC activity remains an outstanding issue. We found that a major culprit for mitotic slippage involves reduction of MAD2 at the kinetochores. resulting in a progressive weakening of SAC during mitotic arrest. A further level of control of the timing of mitotic slippage is through p31 comet-mediated suppression of MAD2 activation. The loss of kinetochore MAD2 was dependent on APC/C CDC20. indicating a feedback control of APC/C to SAC during prolonged mitotic arrest.

1088822,The Role of APOBECs in Viral Replication,2020,Wendy Kaichun Xu and Hyewon Byun and Jaquelin P Dudley,8,,12,1899,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) proteins are a diverse and evolutionarily conserved family of cytidine deaminases that provide a variety of functions from tissue-specific gene expression and immunoglobulin diversity to control of viruses and retrotransposons. APOBEC family expansion has been documented among mammalian species. suggesting a powerful selection for their activity. Enzymes with a duplicated zinc-binding domain often have catalytically active and inactive domains. yet both have antiviral function. Although APOBEC antiviral function was discovered through hypermutation of HIV-1 genomes lacking an active Vif protein. much evidence indicates that APOBECs also inhibit virus replication through mechanisms other than mutagenesis. Multiple steps of the viral replication cycle may be affected. although nucleic acid replication is a primary target. Packaging of APOBECs into virions was first noted with HIV-1. yet is not a prerequisite for viral inhibition. APOBEC antagonism may occur in viral producer and recipient cells. Signatures of APOBEC activity include G-to-A and C-to-T mutations in a particular sequence context. The importance of APOBEC activity for viral inhibition is reflected in the identification of numerous viral factors. including HIV-1 Vif. which are dedicated to antagonism of these deaminases. Such viral antagonists often are only partially successful. leading to APOBEC selection for viral variants that enhance replication or avoid immune elimination.,True,Ke2tULIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,1,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/12/1899,1040555941705533914,/scholar?cites=1040555941705533914,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/8/12/1899/pdf,0,0,0
1088823,Unconventional ER to Endosomal Trafficking by a Retroviral Protein,2020,Wendy Kaichun Xu and Yongqiang Gou and Mary M Lozano and Jaquelin P Dudley,,bioRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) encodes a Rem precursor protein that specifies both regulatory and accessory functions. Rem is cleaved at the ER membrane into a functional N-terminal signal peptide (SP) and the C-terminus (Rem-CT). Rem-CT lacks a membrane-spanning domain and a known ER retention signal. yet was not detectably secreted into cell supernatants. Inhibition of intracellular trafficking by the drug Brefeldin A (BFA). which interferes with the ER to Golgi secretory pathway. resulted in dramatically reduced intracellular Rem-CT levels. A Rem mutant lacking glycosylation sites was cleaved into SP and Rem-CT. but was insensitive to BFA. suggesting that unglycosylated Rem-CT does not exit the ER or reach a degradative compartment. BFA reduction of Rem-CT levels was not rescued by proteasome or lysosomal inhibitors. Rem-CT has simple glycans. which are necessary for Rem-CT stability and trafficking. but indicate that Rem-CT does not traffic through the Golgi. Analysis of wild-type Rem-CT and its glycosylation mutant by confocal microscopy revealed that both were primarily localized to the ER lumen. A small fraction of wild-type Rem-CT. but not the unglycosylated mutant. were co-localized with Rab5+ endosomes. Expression of a dominant-negative (DN) form of ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) (T31N) mimicked the effects of BFA by reducing Rem-CT levels. suggesting that Arf1 prevents Rem-CT localization to a degradative compartment. A DN form of the AAA ATPase. p97/VCP. rescued Rem-CT in the presence of BFA or DN Arf1. Thus.

For 5 consecutive weekends beginning 28 September 2007. bats were captured in mist nets at Walls of Jericho and near Paint Rock. Jackson Co.. Alabama.  In addition to the 21 silver-haired bats. 2 hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) and 2 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were preserved as museum specimens.  Claw. wing. feces. and hair samples were taken from 1 big brown bat and 2 silver-haired bats (1 male and 1 female) for comparison between species.  Mean value of signatures of deuterium in claws of silver-haired bats was -87.07‰ (SE = 14.67).  I used GIS maps of the distribution of stable isotopes of hydrogen to determine estimates of distance traveled during migration using signatures of hydrogen isotopes.  Data from analysis of stable isotopes support previous observations that silver-haired bats are migratory and provide evidence that they migrate great distances. possibly >1.600 km.  There was a significant   interaction of sex by night captured on signatures of deuterium (F2.20 = 5.7. P = 0.022).  One-way ANOVAs revealed no difference between sexes (F1.20 < 0.001.

This study tested the effects of temperature. time. and turnover in the scales of juvenile corn snakes (Elaphe guttata) in a controlled. laboratory environment. Snakes were assigned to four treatment groups (24 C. 27 C. 30 C. and freely thermoregulating). and one snake from each group was sacrificed weekly. Scales from each snake were washed. dried. and analyzed for δD and δ 18 O at the Stable Isotope Research Facility for Environmental Research at the University of Utah. The effects of temperature on the turnover of tissues was only significant when comparing the thermoregulating group to the pooled treatment groups (24 C. 27 C. and 30 C) in the δ 18 O of scales (p= 0.006). After normalizing data on the δD and δ 18 O using percent change for comparison. δ 18 O appeared to be turning over at a faster rate than δD as indicated by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test for homogeneity of slopes (F 1. 53= 69.7. p< 0.001). With further testing of assumptions. a modification of our methods could provide information on the composition of drinking water sources in a species that switches between two isotopically distinct sources. such as during seasonal shifts in habitat or migration. and/or estimates of long-term field metabolic rates based on the turnover of these isotopes.

North Carolina: implications for species restoration,2015,Jessica Davis,,2015 NCUR,,,,The southeastern United States contains the most diverse freshwater fauna in North America. yet many of these species are imperiled. The Sicklefin Redhorse is currently an undescribed species of the genus Moxostoma. endemic to the Hiawassee and Little Tennessee river basins of western North Carolina and northern Georgia. They are listed as a priority wildlife species of North Carolina with a state status of “significantly rare”. and are expected to gain federal protection under the Endangered Species Act within the next year. Like many potamodromous fishes. the Sicklefin Redhorse population is at risk of fragmentation due to stream impediments. habitat degradation. and restriction of its natural home range. The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of the Oconaluftee River. which is historically within Sicklefin Redhorse’s home range. for future reintroductions by tracking movement patterns of translocated individuals. Ten native Sicklefin Redhorse were collected from the Tuckasegee River in Swain County. NC. surgically implanted with radio transmitters. and translocated into the Oconaluftee River. Fish were tracked individually using radio telemetry for six months. Movement patterns for newly translocated fish. as well as seasonal patterns for female Sicklefin Redhorse. were comparable to those found within their current range.

1088872,Stream fish response to intermittency and drying in the Ichawaynochaway Creek Basin,2017,Jessica Lynn Davis,,,,,,Streamflow alteration due to the combined effects of water extraction and climate change is recognized as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. Evidence suggests that streamflow intermittence has increased in the southeastern US (Palmer et al. 2008b. Falke et al. 2011). including the Coastal Plain of Georgia. and is projected to continue increasing in the near future (Larned et al. 2010. Golladay and Hicks 2013). The southeastern US is noteworthy for its abundance and diversity of freshwater fishes. While various biotic and abiotic factors determine fish community structure (Power et al. 1988). streamflow alteration can reduce suitability for native fauna (Pringle et al. 2000). Natural resource managers face the challenge of understanding projected increases in intermittency when working towards conserving biological integrity of freshwater systems. Creating models that predict responses of fishes to extended low flows requires an understanding of the relationships between stream flow. fish populations. and community dynamics (Poff et al. 2010). This study focuses on fishes in a Gulf Coastal Plain stream basin in southwestern Georgia. where streamflows are strongly influenced by agricultural water withdrawals and droughts. to explore the effects of stream intermittency on the composition of biologically diverse fish communities. Increases in irrigated agriculture and domestic water consumption have generated concerns for the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems (Dudgeon et al. 2006). Water resource development affects the pattern of flow variability. including the timing. frequency. and magnitude of flow events. which can act as important drivers …,True,NR-dXH0AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessica_Davis28/publication/321627819_Stream_Fish_Response_to_Intermittency_and_Drying_in_the_Ichawaynochaway_Creek_Basin/links/5a29760a0f7e9b63e535180b/Stream-Fish-Response-to-Intermittency-and-Drying-in-the-Ichawaynochaway-Creek-Basin.pdf,7616800378296128000,/scholar?cites=7616800378296128000,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessica_Davis28/publication/321627819_Stream_Fish_Response_to_Intermittency_and_Drying_in_the_Ichawaynochaway_Creek_Basin/links/5a29760a0f7e9b63e535180b/Stream-Fish-Response-to-Intermittency-and-Drying-in-the-Ichawaynochaway-Creek-Basin.pdf,0,0,0

LaVoie,1,Southeastern Fishes Council Proceedings,59,,,The Sicklefin Redhorse is a rare. undescribed species of Moxostoma. endemic to the Hiwassee and Little Tennessee River basins of western North Carolina and northern Georgia. where it has been eliminated from much of its native range. It is listed as endangered in Georgia and threatened in North Carolina. Although it has not been granted federal protected status. this species is the subject of a Candidate Conservation Agreement between federal. state. tribal. and private stakeholders. of which one objective calls for the re-establishment of Sicklefin Redhorse populations throughout its historical range. The objective of our study was to evaluate suitability of North Carolina’s upper Oconaluftee River for reintroduction of Sicklefin Redhorse. by tracking movement patterns of translocated individuals. Ten native Sicklefin Redhorse were collected from the Tuckasegee River in Swain County. NC. implanted with radio transmitters and translocated into the Oconaluftee River upstream from Ela Dam. Fish were tracked individually using radio telemetry for six months. Movement patterns for newly translocated fish. as well as seasonal patterns for females. were comparable to those shown in previous studies within the current range of Sicklefin Redhorse. Although some fish moved extensively. the sedentary patterns observed in females suggests that the upper Oconaluftee River may provide suitable overwinter habitat for the Sicklefin Redhorse. However. additional data are needed concerning spawning suitability and rates of downstream migration past Ela Dam before reintroducing Sicklefin Redhorse back to this portion of its native range.,True,NR-dXH0AAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://trace.tennessee.edu/sfcproceedings/vol1/iss59/5/,,,,https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1294&context=sfcproceedings,0,0,0

Mitochondrial function could therefore influence resource allocation. Critically. mitochondrial function depends on interactions between proteins encoded by the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Severe incompatibilities between these genomes can have pervasive effects on both fitness and longevity. How milder deficits in mitochondrial function affect life-history trade-offs is less well understood. Here. we analyse how mitonuclear interactions affect the trade-off between fecundity and longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. We consider a panel of 10 different mitochondrial DNA haplotypes against two contrasting nuclear backgrounds (w1118 (WE) and Zim53 (ZIM)) in response to high-protein versus standard diet.

The leading compound demonstrated pronounced antimycotic and antibacterial in vitro activity. comparable to or exceeding that of the reference antifungal (fluconazole. terbinafine) and antibacterial/antiseptic (miramistin. benzalkonium chloride) agents. In contrast to many antimicrobials. the leading compound was also active against biofilm-embedded staphylococci and Escherichia coli. While no biofilm structure destruction occurred. all compounds were able to diffuse into the matrix and reduce the number of colony-forming units by three orders of magnitude at 16 × MBC. The leading compound was significantly less toxic than miramistin and benzalkonium chloride and more toxic than the reference antifungal drugs.

There were noninvaded individuals from a natural population of L. stagnalis and laboratory culture; poorly (rear sporocysts and rediae) and heavily invaded (numerous cercariae) ones from a natural population. The AT values for both noninvaded groups were practically identical (31.6 and 32.4 hours. respectively). The AT values for the heavily invaded ones (18.0 hours) were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than for all of groups which mentioned above. The AT value for the non-selected sample from a natural population (22.5 hours) was rather low because of their strong infestation of mollusks (up to 84.6%) with cercaria.

The study of differential migration offers unique opportunities to identify such mechanisms and allows comparisons of the costs and benefits of migration. The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics of short and long-distance migrations. and fitness consequences. in a long-lived seabird species. We combined demographic monitoring (survival. phenology. hatching success) of 58 Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) breeding on Bonaventure Island (Canada) and biologging technology (Global Location Sensor or GLS loggers) to estimate activity and energy budgets during the non-breeding period for three different migration strategies: to the Gulf of Mexico (GM). southeast (SE) or northeast (NE) Atlantic coast of the U.S. Survival. timing of arrival at the colony and hatching success are similar for short (NE. SE) and long-distance (GM) migrants. Despite similar fitness consequences. we found. as expected. that the overall energetic cost of migration is higher for long-distance migrants. although the daily cost during migration was similar between strategies. In contrast. daily maintenance and thermoregulation costs were lower for GM migrants in winter. where sea-surface temperature of the GM is 4-7o C warmer than SE and NE. In addition. GM migrants tend to fly 30 min less per day in their wintering area than other migrants.

The Arctic tundra is a low productivity ecosystem supporting simple food webs. but several predators often feed on the same prey species. lemmings. known for their large‐amplitude population fluctuations. We examined mechanisms involved in reducing intra‐guild competition and allowing coexistence of four avian predators (snowy owls. glaucous gulls. rough‐legged hawks and long‐tailed jaegers) feeding on a pulsed resource (brown and collared lemmings). We compared the size and species of prey consumed by predators to see if resource partitioning occurred. We also verified if spatial segregation in nesting areas could be another mechanism allowing coexistence. Finally. we tested if the absence of the snowy owl. a dominant and irruptive species. triggered a competitive release on the smallest predator. the jaeger. with …,True,LpCpjSYAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,0,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1365-2656.13346,,,,,0,0,0

The recent discovery that mutations in genes encoding structural RNA exosome subunits cause tissue-specific diseases makes defining the role of this complex within specific tissues critically important. Mutations in the RNA exosome component 3 (EXOSC3) gene cause Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1b (PCH1b). an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder. The majority of disease-linked mutations are missense mutations that alter evolutionarily-conserved regions of EXOSC3. The tissue-specific defects caused by these amino acid changes in EXOSC3 are challenging to understand based on current models of RNA exosome function with only limited analysis of the complex in any multicellular model in vivo. The goal of this study is to provide insight into how mutations in EXOSC3 impact the function of the RNA exosome. To assess the tissue-specific roles and requirements for the Drosophila ortholog of EXOSC3 termed Rrp40. we utilized tissue-specific RNAi drivers. Depletion of Rrp40 in different tissues reveals a general requirement for Rrp40 in the development of many tissues including the brain. but also highlight an age-dependent requirement for Rrp40 in neurons. To assess the functional consequences of the specific amino acid substitutions in EXOSC3 that cause PCH1b. we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to generate flies that model this RNA exosome-linked disease.

J. Dev. Biol,,325-333,,The POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) genes encode a large transcription factor family comprising 6 classes (pou1f to pou6f) involved in many developmental processes. such as cell commitment and differentiation. The pou3f class contains four members (pou3f1. pou3f2. pou3f3. pou3f4) characterized by expression in ectodermal tissue derivatives. such as nervous system and otic vesicle. during mammalian development. In order to obtain insights into the potential conservation of this class of transcription factors in vertebrates. we carried out a phylogenetic analysis and a comprehensive comparative study of pou3f expression in the frog Xenopus laevis. All vertebrates examined possessed members of the four pou3f subfamilies. excepting the zebrafish. which lacked a pou3f4 gene. Whole mount in situ hybridization and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses revealed that Xenopus pou3f genes were expressed in the forming neural tube and their expression was maintained in the brain. mostly in the dorsal part. at tailbud stages.

1088961,Ambulacrarians and the ancestry of deuterostome nervous systems,2019,Laurent Formery and Michael Schubert and Jenifer C Croce,,,,31-59,Springer. Cham,The evolutionary origin and history of metazoan nervous systems has been at the heart of numerous scientific debates for well over a century. This has been a particularly difficult issue to resolve within the deuterostomes. chiefly due to the distinct neural architectures observed within this group of animals. Indeed. deuterosomes feature central nervous systems. apical organs. nerve cords. and basiepidermal nerve nets. Comparative analyses investigating the anatomy and molecular composition of deuterostome nervous systems have nonetheless succeeded in identifying a number of shared and derived features. These analyses have led to the elaboration of diverse theories about the origin and evolutionary history of deuterostome nervous systems. Here. we provide an overview of these distinct theories. Further. we argue that deciphering the adult nervous systems of representatives of all deuterostome …,True,H6iEC0YAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23459-1_3,7077711295904228866,/scholar?cites=7077711295904228866,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Laurent_Formery/publication/336392542_Ambulacrarians_and_the_Ancestry_of_Deuterostome_Nervous_Systems/links/5f4a66b3458515a88b859b6f/Ambulacrarians-and-the-Ancestry-of-Deuterostome-Nervous-Systems.pdf,0,0,0

This study aims to design and test the primer optimum temperature for the S. typhimurium flagellin gene (fljB) with the Gradient Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique. The in silico analysis using Professional Clone Manager program 9.2 for the primer design showed that the fljB primer pair could amplify S. typhimurium fljB fragments to produce amplicon with size 106 base pairs (bp). Evaluation of the primer ability of the design result and determination of the optimum temperature to produce amplicons of the right size was carried out by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Gradient. The temperature variation on PCR-Gradient is 56–61 C. The S. typhimurium isolate as a template for the Gradient PCR process has a concentration of 53.75 ng/μΛ with purity (A260/280) of 1.85. The results of the study generously information that the fljB primer provides optimal results at annealing temperatures 60 C. This is indicated by the production of a DNA band with a size of 106 base pairs in accordance with the analysis in silico and has a thickness band intensity. Based on the results obtained. it can be concluded that the optimal temperature of the fljB primer of S. typhimurium is 60 C.

This study aimed to map the regulatory networks driven by circular RNAs (circRNAs) in CSC-enriched colorectal cancer (CRC) spheroid cells. The spheroid cells established from two CRC cell lines acquired stemness properties in pluripotency gene expression and multi-lineage differentiation capacity. Genome-wide sequencing identified 1503 and 636 circRNAs specific to the CRC parental and spheroid cells. respectively. In the CRC spheroids. algorithmic analyses unveiled a core network of mRNAs involved in modulating stemness-associated signaling pathways. driven by a circRNA–microRNA (miRNA)–mRNA axis. The two major circRNAs. hsa_circ_0066631 and hsa_circ_0082096. in this network were significantly up-regulated in expression levels in the spheroid cells. The two circRNAs were predicted to target and were experimentally shown to down-regulate miR-140-3p. miR-224. miR-382. miR-548c-3p and miR-579. confirming circRNA sponging of the targeted miRNAs. Furthermore. the affected miRNAs were demonstrated to inhibit degradation of six mRNA targets. viz. ACVR1C/ALK7. FZD3. IL6ST/GP130. SKIL/SNON. SMAD2 and WNT5. in the CRC spheroid cells. These mRNAs encode proteins that are reported to variously regulate the GP130/Stat. Activin/Nodal. TGF-β/SMAD or Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways in controlling various aspects of CSC stemness.

The applications of multifarious rhizobacteria can help to overcome these issues. however. the effect of co-inoculation of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and biochar on growth andnutrient levelsin soybean and on the level of soil nutrients and enzymes needs in-depth study. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of co-inoculation of multifarious Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 and Pseudomonas putida TSAU1 and different levels (1 and 3%) of biochar on growth parameters and nutrient levelsin soybean and on the level of soil nutrients and enzymes. Effect of co-inoculation of rhizobacteria and biochar (1 and 3%) on the plant growth parameters and soil biochemicals were studied in pot assay experiments under greenhouse conditions. Both produced good amounts of indole-acetic acid;(22 and 16 µg mL− 1). siderophores (79 and 87% SU). and phosphate solubilization (0.89 and 1.02 99 g mL− 1). Co-inoculation of B. japonicum with P. putida and 3% biochar significantly improved the growth and nutrient content ofsoybean and the level of nutrients and enzymes in the soil. thus making the soil more fertile to support crop yield.

It is shown that the studied cotton species differ in the content of water soluble protein markers. designated according to their electrophoretic mobility by the symbols H-0.13 and B-0.18 and the buffer fraction. denoted by the characters AU and BD. Inheritance of protein markers H-0.13 and B-0.18 corresponds to monohybrid co-dominant cleavage. The loci of protein markers H-0.13 and B-0.18 are interconnected with a number of biochemical and morphological characters. Protein markers H-0.13 and B-0.18 turned out to be convenient when studying the genealogy of G.hirsutum L. and G.barbadense L. species. In diploid cotton species of the genomic group D. protein H-0.13 was found in seeds of the species G. trilobum. and protein B-0.18 in the species G. thurberi. which suggests that these cotton species participated in the formation of the amphidiploid species G.hirsutum L. and G.barbadense L. The cotton species studied also differ in the composition of protein markers buffer fraction. The species of cotton G.hirsutum L. contains protein markers designated by the symbols AC. BD. and BCD. whereas in the species G.barbadense L. there are only protein markers AC. The cleavage of protein markers AC and BD in generations of interspecific hybrids depends on the combination of hybrids.

Tuta absoluta (Meyrick)(Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). a destructive pest on tomato. has invaded most Afro-Eurasian countries. Recently invaded by the pest. most tomato crops in greenhouses and open fields in Tajikistan are currently suffering major damage. While failure in management using chemical insecticide has been frequently observed. alternative options such as biological control is urgently needed. In this study. we evaluated the effectiveness of the common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens)(Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) against T. absoluta. In controlled laboratory conditions. C. carnea showed high predation rate on both T. absoluta eggs (ie. 36±2 eggs within 24 h and 72±4 eggs within 48 h) and larvae. especially it can attack the larvae both inside and outside the leaf galleries (ie. an average of 22% of the larvae was killed inside. and an average of 35% was killed outside). In a cage exclusion experiment. T. absoluta showed relatively low larval density in the cages with pre-fruiting release of C. carnea. whereas the larval density was four to six times higher in the “no release” cages. In the “post-fruiting release” cages. the pest population that had already built up during the pre-fruiting stage eventually crashed. In an open-field experiment. the tomato crops in control plots were fully destroyed. whereas low levels of larvae density and damage were observed in the biocontrol plots. Moreover. the field release of C. carnea resulted in significantly higher tomato yield than those without release. despite no differences between the “pre-fruiting release” and “post-fruiting release” treatments.

1089005,Characterizing the effects of chronic 2G centrifugation on the rat skeletal system,2017,Aimee Johnson and Ryan Scott and April E Ronca and Tana M Hoban-Higgins and Charles A Fuller and Joshua S Alwood,,,,,,During weightlessness. the skeletal system of astronauts is negatively affected by decreased calcium absorption and bone mass loss. Therefore. it is necessary to counteract these changes for long-term skeletal health during space flights. Our long-term plan is to assess artificial gravity (AG) as a possible solution to mitigate these changes. In this study. we aim to determine the skeletal acclimation to chronic centrifugation. We hypothesize that a 2G hypergravity environment causes an anabolic response in growing male rats. Specifically. we predict chronic 2G to increase tissue mineral density. bone volume fraction of the cancellous tissue and to increase overall bone strength. Systemically. we predict that bone formation markers (ie. osteocalcin) are elevated and resorption markers (ie. tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) are decreased or unchanged from controls. The experiment has three groups. each with an n8: chronic 2g. cage control (housed on the centrifuge. but not spun). and a vivarium control (normal rat caging). Pre-pubescent. male Long-Evans rats were used to assess our hypothesis. This group was subject to 90 days of 2G via centrifugation performed at the Chronic Acceleration Research Unit (CARU) at University of California Davis. After 90 days. animals were euthanized and tissues collected. Blood was drawn via cardiac puncture and the right leg collected for structural (via microcomputed tomography) and strength quantification. Understanding how counteract these skeletal changes will have major impacts for both the space-faring astronauts and the people living on Earth.,True,Xy9lW6wAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,0,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20170011058,,,,,0,0,0

However. some effects of this approach on rodent physiology are under-studied. specifically the effects on ovarian estrogen production which drives the estrous cycle. To resolve this deficiency. we conducted a ground-based validation study using the HU model. while monitoring estrous cycles in 16-weeks-old female C57BL6 mice. Animals were exposed to HU for 12 days following a 3 day HU cage acclimation period. and estrous cycling was analyzed in HU animals (n= 22). normally loaded HU Cage Pair-Fed controls (CPF; n= 22). and Vivarium controls fed ad libitum (VIV; n= 10). Pair feeding was used to control for potential nutritional deficits on ovarian function. Vaginal cells were sampled daily in all mice via saline lavage. Cells were dried and stained with crystal violet. and the smears evaluated using established vaginal cytology techniques by two individuals blinded to the animal treatment group. Estrous cyclicity was disrupted in nearly all HU and CPF mice. while those maintained in VIV had an average normal cycle length of 4.8+/-0.5 days. with all stages in the cycle visibly observed. CPF and HU animals arrested in the diestrous phase. which precedes the pre-ovulatory estrogen surge. Additionally. infection-like symptoms characterized by vaginal discharge and swelling arose in several HU animals. which we suspect was due to an inability of these mice to properly groom themselves. and/or due to the change in the gravity vector relative to the vaginal opening. which prevented drainage of the lavage solution.

One countermeasure for the skeletal health of astronauts includes an antiresorptive of the bisphosphonate (BP) drug class. We asked. does the combination of an anti-resorptive and high-force exercise during weightlessness have negative effects on bone remodeling and strength? In this study. we developed an integrated model to mimic the mechanical strain of exercise via cyclical loading (CL) in mice treated with the BP Zoledronate (ZOL) combined with hind limb unloading (HU) to simulate weightlessness. We hypothesized that ZOL prevents structural degradation from simulated weightlessness and that CL and ZOL interact to render CL less effective. Thirty-two C57BL/6 mice (male. 16 weeks old. n= 8/group) were exposed to 3 weeks of either HU or normal ambulation (NA). Cohorts of mice received one subcutaneous injection of ZOL (45μg/kg). or saline vehicle (VEH). prior to the start of HU.

Ex vivo μCT was performed on all subjects to determine cancellous and cortical architectural parameters. Static and dynamic histomorphometry were carried out for the left and right tibiae to determine osteoclast-and osteoblast relevant surfaces.

Current countermeasures include an anti-resorptive drug class. bisphosphonates (BP). and high-force loading regimens. Does the combination of anti-resorptives and high-force exercise during weightlessness have negative effects on the mechanical and structural properties of bone? In this study. we implemented an integrated model to mimic mechanical strain of exercise via cyclical loading (CL) in mice treated with the BP Zoledronate (ZOL) combined with hindlimb unloading (HU). Our working hypothesis is that CL combined with ZOL in the HU model induces additive structural and mechanical changes.

Objectives: To examine the validity of this claim and review the possible implications and repercussion of such a claim–if true–on some aspects of mitochondrial biochemistry and biophysics. Results: Both the chemical gradient and the electrical gradient Gibbs energy terms in the central equation of chemiosmotic theory are temperature dependent. the first explicitly and the second implicitly. A hotter mitochondrion–as claimed–would imply a 3% correction in the chemical gradient term. but we cannot estimate the corresponding effect on the electrical term at this time since the functional dependence of the voltage on the temperature is not known to the best of the authors’ knowledge. Further. if this claim is true and to the extent claimed (10 C). this may imply some heat-engine character for mitochondrial thermodynamic operation albeit this may only represent 4% at most.Conclusions: Doubts and criticisms regarding the suggestion of a hotter mitochondrion have been raised and are briefly discussed. These doubts are contrasted with some data and considerations that support the claim of a hotter mitochondrion. It is concluded that the mitochondrion is probably hotter than its environment but not to the extent claimed by Chrétien et al. and that the thermodynamic efficiency and the mode of operation of the mitochondrion as an electrochemical battery are very slightly perturbed by even the maximum claimed revision of the temperature of its operation.,True,YonkS68AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,2,https://periodicals.karazin.ua/biophysvisnyk/article/view/14663,99322309833015644,/scholar?cites=99322309833015644,,https://periodicals.karazin.ua/biophysvisnyk/article/download/14663/14534,0,0,0

Taking into account these assumptions. it is shown that most of the instabilities investigated are stipulated by the sign change of derivative of kinetic coefficients with respect to electron temperature.

Research has been conducted to evaluate the influence of cell immobilization on cell growth and catharanthine production in C.roseus culture. Callus was first initiated in MS medium with 1.5 mg/L 2.4-D and 0.15 mg/L kinetin. The cell agregate derived from callus of Catharanthus roseus was cultured in MS medium with 2mg/L NAA and 0.2 mg/L kinetin. and subcultured every 10 days for 4 times before immobilization. Immobilization was conducted by using 2.5% Na-alginate. The cell growth and production pattern of catharanthine in the cells agregate were observed every 3 days for 27 days. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted by using HPLC. eluted by using methanol : acetonitrile : diamoniumhydrogenphosphate (3:4:3). rate: 1ml/minute.

Water resources have been declining in many catchments during recent decades. This study investigated patterns of river water quality status in a peri-urban/rural catchment in Bolivia in relation to land use during a 26 year period. Satellite images were used to determine changes in land use. To assess water quality. data in the dry season from former studies (1991–2014). complemented with newly collected data (2017). were analysed using the National Sanitation Foundation-Water Quality Index method and the Implicit Pollution Index method. The highest rates of relative increase in land use area were observed for forest. urban. and peri-urban areas. whereas relative decreases were observed for water infiltration zones. bare soil. shrubland. and grassland areas. The water quality indices revealed clear water quality deterioration over time. and from catchment headwaters to outlet. Statistical analyses revealed a significant relationship between decreasing water quality and urban expansion. These results demonstrate the need for an effective control programme. preferably based on water quality index approaches as in the present study and including continuous monitoring of runoff water. mitigation of pollution. and water quality restoration. in order to achieve proper water management and quality.

Even though the interpretation of natural language messages is generally conceived as the result of a conscious processing of the message content. the influence of unconscious factors is also well known. What is still insufficiently known is the way such factors work. We have tackled interpretation assuming it is a process. whose basic features are the same for the whole humankind. and employing a naturalistic approach (careful observation of phenomena in conditions the closest to “natural” ones. and precise description before and independently of data statistical analysis).Methodology. Our field research involved a random sample of 102 adults. We presented them with a complete real world-like case of written communication using unabridged message texts. We collected data (participants’ written reports on their interpretations) in controlled conditions through a specially designed questionnaire (closed and opened answers); then. we treated it through qualitative and quantitative methods.Principal Findings. We gathered some evidence that. in written message interpretation. between reading and the attribution of conscious meaning. an intermediate step could exist (we named it “disassembling”) which looks like an automatic reaction to the text words/expressions. Thus. the process of interpretation would be a discontinuous sequence of three steps having different natures: the initial “decoding” step (i.e.. reading. which requires technical abilities). disassembling (the automatic reaction. an unconscious passage) and the final conscious attribution of meaning.

After 6 generations and about 96% of homozygosity. 60 separate recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were recovered. The parental lines were previously subjected to molecular screening for polymorphism. The polymorphic markers detected in the parental inbred lines were screened across the genomic DNA of all the RILs for segregating allelic loci. Presence or absence of gel bands were scored as alleles due to the homogeneity attained by the inbred lines after 6 generations of self-fertilization. From the polymorphic markers detected. 19 were scored throughout the RIL population.

Majeed and S.H. Abbas and M. Noman,33,"Sarhad J. Agric.,",(2),282-287,,Deficiency of Phosphorus (P) is a serious concern for agricultural productivity in more than 90% of Pakistan’s soils. In addition to P deficiency. high pH level and soil carbonate contents further limit the utilization of P by plants. This research was conducted during wheat cropping season of year 2010 and 2011 and it consisted of determination of the residual effect of six treatments (T0= control without rock phosphate & farmyard manure. T1= rock phosphate@ 150 kg P2O5 per hectare. T2= FYM@ 5 tons per hectare. T3= RP@ 100 kg P2O5 per hectare+ FYM@ 5 tons per hectare. E0= without effective microbes and E1= EM-Biozote@ 50 l ha-1) on yield parametrs of wheat crop planted after the harvest of rice. All yield parameters significantly increased by the treatments consisting of RP (100 kg) with FYM (5 t ha-1) and EM@ 50 l ha-1. which also enhanced the nutrient uptake of the crop. It can be concluded that accurate use of cheaper rock phosphate. farm yard manure and effective microbes proved as an alternative of costly fertilizers and sustaining the agricultural productivity.

It presents critical and creative perspectives to generate alternative structures of subjectivity. These alternative structures gain relevance when intersectional variables of privilege and discrimination as political tools are set in crisis by a postanthropocentric awareness. The thesis of this article is that in order to understand and develop postanthropocentric intersectional positions. the microbial posthuman joins the cartographies of the posthuman as a material possibility from microscopic biological matter and philosophical and artistic thought. This microbial posthuman also allows for a reframing in the light of microbiopolitics. a redistribution of pain. life and death within a broader notion of life.,True,MVURUtIAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,0,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/ta/2018/00000016/00000003/art00009,,,,,0,0,0

The State as well as Central Government was not in a position to release the promised funds to the marine fishing communities in the state of Andhra Pradesh especially to the Prakasam District.

The poverty alleviation programmes of both the GOs & NGOs are either nominal or temporary or non-functional due to the short sightedness. growing disparities among the fishing communities based on the gears that were used. ultimately leading to the depletion of fish by overfishing in the study area.

Studies were conducted on two freshwater Chlorophytes. Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus to evaluate heterotrophic growth rate and biomass productivity in filter-sterilized defined medium (BG 11) and municipal wastewater. both with varying concentrations of nitrogen (N). For each isolate. cultures were separately incubated in triplicate at room temperature with constant agitation on a shaker at 150 rpm for 9 days. In 0.25 mg N/L BG11 medium. the growth rate and biomass productivity of C. vulgaris were 0.28 day-1 and 3.5 g·L-1. respectively. In wastewater. the same amount of N addition resulted in a higher growth rate 0.44 day-1 and associated biomass productivity of 4.96 g·L-1. Increasing N levels to 0.5 mg N/L in BG11 caused an increase in growth rate (0.37 day-1) and biomass productivity (4.28 g·L-1). while the increase in N in wastewater caused growth to decline to 0.32 day-1 with decreased biomass productivity of 2.19 g·L-1. A further increase in N to 1.0 mg N/L in BG11 caused an increase in the growth rate (0.43 day-1) and a decrease in biomass productivity (3.64 g·L-1). while in wastewater. growth rate and productivity of C. vulgaris were 0.32 day-1 and 2.31 g·L-1. respectively. Overall. C. vulgaris grew faster and produced greater biomass than S. obliquus under comparable conditions. Based on high growth rate and biomass productivity of C. vulgaris. it could be a potential candidate for further consideration for simultaneous wastewater treatment and biofuel production.,True,xeOvFG4AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,3,https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=63719,6369327234345521073,/scholar?cites=6369327234345521073,,https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=63719,0,0,0

This study investigated the foraging behavior of guppy in relation to its use as a biological control method of mosquito larvae under varying conditions of prey types. the physicochemical condition of the habitat and also the social context in which they are foraging. Guppies were exposed to mosquito larvae of Culex and Anopheles under varying conditions which included foraging alone. female focal singly and male focal singly. alongside male and/or female conspecifics in laboratory and field water samples. The study showed that female guppy fed significantly more than the male guppy both in the presence and absence of companions. the guppies’ higher preference for Culex to Anopheles larvae was significant at p< 0.05 and their foraging behavior was better in the laboratory water as compared to their habitat water. These results suggest that the preference and the foraging behavior of the guppies varied with social and environmental conditions which may be as a result of varying social conditions and the relative differences in the physicochemical quality of the media. It is apparent that the sex of the forager. the social environment. habitat quality and complexity are each capable of affecting foraging behavior and prey use. therefore these factors should be integrated when introducing guppies as biological agent for mosquito control.,True,xeOvFG4AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,1,https://www.academia.edu/download/49454876/ANALYSIS_OF_THE_FORAGING_BEHAVIOR_OF_GUP20161008-3843-1j8mll8.pdf,4724191295050401075,/scholar?cites=4724191295050401075,,https://www.academia.edu/download/49454876/ANALYSIS_OF_THE_FORAGING_BEHAVIOR_OF_GUP20161008-3843-1j8mll8.pdf,0,0,0
1089140,Coupling Microalgae Productivity to Wastewater Treatment and Biofuel Production,2015,Omowunmi Fadeyi,,,,,,Microalgae are emerging as one of the most promising agents for bioremediation through their abilities to remove polluting nutrients while converting biomass produced into lipids. In this study. growth and biomass productivity by microalgae strains. Chlorella vulgaris. Scenedesmus obliquus and TG511 (Gloeocystis vesiculosa) were evaluated for coupling wastewater treatment to biodiesel production. The isolates were heterotrophically cultured in filter-sterilized defined medium (BG11) or secondary municipal wastewater that was fortified with NaNO3 (0.25. 0.5 and 1 mg/L) to find the levels of nitrogen at which biomass productivities of C. vulgaris. S. obliquus and G. vesiculosa (TG511) would be optimized. The result showed that the biomass productivities of C. vulgaris. S. obliquus and G. vesiculosa cultivated in 1 mg/L NaNO 3 of modified BG11 were 3.64. 3.37 and 4.11 gram per liter respectively. Corresponding biomass productivities by the isolates in wastewater were 2.31. 1.27 and 1.78 grams per liter respectively. The nitrate removal efficiency by C. vulgaris. S. obliquus and G. vesiculosa at concentration of 1 mg/LW were 23.43. 4.61 and 20.48%. respectively. In the three isolate used. the commonly dominant Fatty Acid Methyl Esters were Palmitic. Oleic. Linoleic and Linolenic acid which ranged from is similar 16% to 30%. 17% to 57%. 4% to 44% and 4% to 21%. respectively.

It is one of the important steps towards creating the 21st century learning environment as it promotes the integration of student-centered and technology-enriched learning environment for learners. Despite the many benefits that this learning tool has to offer. many educators are still reluctant to integrate this kind of technology in their classes which resulted in low implementation of this technology among the educators.  Therefore. this study is intended to determine pre-service teachers’ experience and perceptions towards digital storytelling for 21st century skills in learning environment. A set of questionnaire has been distributed to 150 trainee teachers from the Faculty of Education in one of public universities in Malaysia. The result of this study reveals that preservice teachers’ have moderately experienced the use of digital storytelling in their learning (M=2.98; SD=1.332). The finding also showed that the pre-service teachers responded positively towards the use of digital storytelling in the classroom (M=3.94; SD=0.713). The correlation analysis further showed that. the pre-service teachers’ experience with digital storytelling has significantly given impact on their perception towards the implementation of this tool in teaching and learning process.

The experiment was carried out by exposing onion to 10. 100. 500 and 1000 µM AlCl 3 for 24. 48 and 72 hour. Parameters observed were root length and diameter. root tip mitotic index. cortical parenchyma cell length and cortical cell layer thickness. Onion defense response observed by measuring mallic. citric and oxalic acid quantitatively. and the accumulation of Al and callose in root qualitatively. Results showed that an increase in the concentration of Al caused a decrease in root length. At concentrations up to 100 µM. Al increased root diameter cell length whilst at higher concentrations. Al decreased both parameters. Compared to control. all Al-treated root had lower index mitosis with 10 uM Al-treated root displayed highest IM. Since root treated with Al higher than 10 µM showed none or very low mitotic activity. chromosome aberration can only be observed in 10 uM Al–treated roots. Root defense response via Al and callose accumulation was increased with the increasing of Al concentrations. Organic acids were present in higher amounts in root than in medium with a ratio of 5000: 1. Oxalic acid appeared to be the major organic acid that played a role in defense mechanisms against Al stress. Based on the results. it can be concluded that (1) Al 3+ were toxic to Allium cepa because it caused root growth inhibition and chromosomal aberrations;(2) defense response for Al 3+ stress were via the increase of callose as well as Al accumulation and organic acids content in root cells.,True,4LdqTdAAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,0,https://jms.fmipa.itb.ac.id/index.php/jms/article/view/805,,,,https://jms.fmipa.itb.ac.id/index.php/jms/article/download/805/528,0,0,0

In the current study. we shed the light on the relation between P53 and some aspects of gastric carcinoma patients by using immunohistochemical assay by taking 43 biopsies randomly from patients already have gastrectomy. samples were collected during the period from January 2015 until January 2016. including 26 patients above 50 years old and 17 under that age. male: female ratio 2: 1 with 30 men and 13 women. Histological grade including 21 well differentiated. 13 moderately and 9 poor differentiated types. According to TNM staging. 26 patients out of 43 falling in stages I and II. and the rest 17 patients were falling in stages III and IV. Whereas. the current study involved 27 smoker patients and 16 non-smokers. Here and by using immunohistochemical assay. P53 were detected in 28 out of 43 patients (65%). in the other hand. the positive results related in highly significant association to each of age. gender. histological grade. stage of the tumor and tobacco smoking of gastric carcinoma patients.,True,cWM1tpwAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noor_Al_Huda_Saeed2/publication/341275994_EXPRESSION_OF_TUMOR_SUPPRESSOR_GENE_P53_CORRELATION_WITH_GASTRIC_ADENOCARCINOMA_PATIENTS_BY_USING_IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL_ASSAY/links/5eb7769f4585152169c13644/EXPRESSION-OF-TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR-GENE-P53-CORRELATION-WITH-GASTRIC-ADENOCARCINOMA-PATIENTS-BY-USING-IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL-ASSAY.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Noor_Al_Huda_Saeed2/publication/341275994_EXPRESSION_OF_TUMOR_SUPPRESSOR_GENE_P53_CORRELATION_WITH_GASTRIC_ADENOCARCINOMA_PATIENTS_BY_USING_IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL_ASSAY/links/5eb7769f4585152169c13644/EXPRESSION-OF-TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR-GENE-P53-CORRELATION-WITH-GASTRIC-ADENOCARCINOMA-PATIENTS-BY-USING-IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL-ASSAY.pdf,0,0,0
