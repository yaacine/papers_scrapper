Characterization of MHS included infrared and X-ray fluorescence analysis. The effect of shaking time. initial dye concentration. temperature. adsorbent dosage and pH has been investigated. The results of adsorption experiments indicate that the maximum capacity of Congo Red and Naphthol Green B dyes at equilibrium (q e) and percentage of removal at pH 6 are 40 mg/g. 93 %. and 10 mg/g. 52 %. respectively. Some kinetic models were used to illustrate the adsorption process of Congo Red and Naphthol Green B dyes using MHS waste. Thermodynamic parameters such as (ΔG.

Ce. Nd. Sm) on resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin was studied. The effect of pH. shaking time. and temperature on the metal distribution coefficients was examined. The RF resin affinity for the examined lanthanides increases with a decrease in the ionic radius of the metal ion: Sm > Ce > Nd > La. The capacity of RF resins for the lanthanides shows the same trend. Because of the relatively high capacity of the resin. the presence of interfering ions affects the sorption percentage of the light REEs insignificantly. The thermodynamic functions of the sorption process were determined. They show that the adsorption of the light lanthanides on RF resin occurs spontaneously with the dehydrated metal ion.,True,_gCZqfwAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC,18,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S1066362211040102,7505176884408223603,/scholar?cites=7505176884408223603,,,0,0,0

Diponegoro University,Copper/Copper oxide (Cu/Cu2O) nanoparticles were synthesized by modified chemical reduction method in an aqueous medium using hydrazine as reducing agent and copper sulfate pentahydrate as precursor. The Cu/Cu2O nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The analysis revealed the pattern of face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure of copper Cu metal and cubic cuprites structure for Cu2O. The SEM result showed monodispersed and agglomerated particles with two micron sizes of about 180 nm and 800 nm. respectively. The TEM result showed few single crystal particles of face-centered cubic structures with average particle size about 11-14 nm. The catalytic activity of Cu/Cu2O nanoparticles for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was investigated and compared with manganese oxide MnO2. The results showed that the second-order equation provides the best correlation for the catalytic decomposition of H2O2 onCu/Cu2O. The catalytic activity of hydrogen peroxide by Cu/Cu2O is less than the catalytic activity of MnO2 due to the presence of copper metal Cu with cuprous oxide Cu2O.© 2015 BCREC UNDIP.

However. compared to ruthenium dyes. most organic sensitizers generally exhibit narrower absorption bands at shorter wavelengths. resulting in less effective light-harvesting. This disadvantage is related to their commonly accepted design rule (relying on the well-known D–π–A concept) in which an electron-donating group (D) and an electron-withdrawing group (A) are connected through a suitable π-spacer (π).[4] In fact. small π-bridges are usually preferred in comparison to more π-extended spacers that do increase the portion of absorbed sunlight but. at the same time. facilitate the formation of undesired aggregates [5] and are relatively unstable when irradiated with high-energy photons.[6] However. the formation of dye aggregates can be limited by the use of suitable co-adsorbents.[7] although with unpredictable results in terms of device efficiency.

Indigoids are natural dyes that have been produced for centuries. and indigo is currently the most produced dye worldwide. Herein we review the history of these materials. their chemistry and physical properties. and their semiconducting characteristics in the solid state. Due to hydrogen bonding and π‐stacking. indigo and Tyrian purple form highly‐ordered crystalline thin films. Such films have been used to fabricate high‐performance organic field‐effect transistors with ambipolar charge transport. as well as complementary‐like circuits. Mobility values were found to be in the range of 10−2–0.4 cm2/Vs. With performance on par with the best available organic semiconductors. indigoids demonstrate the potential of sustainable electronics …,True,AXO1lWYAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,115,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijch.201100130,16428331437661444146,/scholar?cites=16428331437661444146,,,0,0,0

Unlike pentacene. quinacridone has limited intramolecular π-conjugation and becomes highly colored in the solid state due to strong intermolecular electronic coupling. We found that quinacridone shows a field-effect mobility of 0.1 cm2/V·s. comparable to mobilities of pentacene in similarly prepared devices.

Nevertheless. even utilization of TADF can be further improved. introducing a novel concept. This is demonstrated by a new class of brightly luminescent low-cost Cu(I) compounds. for which the emission stems from both the lowest excited triplet T1 and singlet S1 state. At T = 300 K. these materials exhibit quantum yields of more than ΦPL = 90% at short emission decay times. About 80% of the emission intensity stems from the singlet due to TADF. but importantly. an additional 20% is contributed by the lower lying triplet state according to effective spin–orbit coupling (SOC). SOC induces also a relatively large zero-field splitting of the triplet being unusual for Cu(I) complexes.

The choice of cerium was related to its low toxicity associated with bacteriostatic properties; cerium-doped bioactive glasses could be useful when implantation concerns local infected areas. The maximum value that permitted forming a homogeneous glass was 13.5 wt% and enabled us to get a better insight into CeO2 effect on the chemical behaviour of glasses. The as-quenched glasses were characterized by means of magnetic and spectroscopic measurements that revealed the prevailing presence of cerium (III).

Solid content appears to be the most important parameter among the studied ones. As well known. it has an influence both on viscosity. shear behaviour and yield stress. Instead the additive. an industrial grade sodium polyacrilate. has demonstrated to have a poor effect on the viscosity and yield stress. In synergy with curing time. temperature showed a different effect with respect to its classic rheological influence.

Despite this fact. relatively little progress has been made in the field of pressure recognition compared to the areas of sight and voice recognition. mainly because good artificial “electronic skin” with a large area and mechanical flexibility is not yet available. The fabrication of a sensitive skin consisting of thousands of pressure sensors would require a flexible switching matrix that cannot be realized with present silicon-based electronics.

Usually. sensitive and spatially accurate pressure sensors are achieved through conformal contact with the surface; however. this also makes them sensitive to mechanical deformation (bending). Indeed. when a soft object is pressed by another soft object. the normal pressure cannot be measured independently from the mechanical stress. Here. we show a pressure sensor that measures only the normal pressure. even under extreme bending conditions.

However. the additional steps often required to install and remove directing groups currently detract from the efficiency. The strategy of reversible installation of a directing group via an imine linkage has recently emerged. with the imine formed and hydrolysed in situ. Such transient directing groups can promote transition metal catalysed functionalisation of unactivated C–H bonds of aldehydes. ketones and amines. This approach removes additional steps usually required for covalent directing groups and can use catalytic quantities of the imine forming component.
