1054642,Hesperidin. an antioxidant flavonoid. prevents acrylonitrile‐induced oxidative stress in rat brain,2008,El‐Sayed M El‐Sayed and Osama M Abo‐Salem and Mohamed F Abd‐Ellah and Gamil M Abd‐Alla,22,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,4,268-273,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,Acrylonitrile (ACN) is a volatile. toxic liquid used as a monomer in the manufacture of synthetic rubber. styrene plastics. acrylic fiber. and adhesives. ACN is a potent neurotoxin. A role for free radical mediated lipid peroxidation in the toxicity of ACN has been suggested. We examined the ability of hesperidin. an antioxidant flavonoid. to attenuate ACN‐induced alterations in lipid peroxidation in rat brains. The daily oral administration of ACN to male albino rats in a dose of 50 mg/kg bwt for a period of 28 days produced a significant elevation in brain lipid peroxides measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) amounting to 107%. accompanied by a marked decrease in brain‐reduced glutathione (GSH) content reaching 63%. In addition. ACN administration resulted in significant reductions in the enzymatic antioxidant parameters of brain; superoxide dismutase (SOD). catalase (CAT). glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐Px). and …,True,P_wb79MAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,60,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbt.20237,14584795116294542208,/scholar?cites=14584795116294542208,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/El_Sayed_El-Sayed4/publication/312653147_Hesperidin_an_antioxidant_flavonoid_prevents_acrylonitrile-induced_oxidative_stress_in_rat_brain/links/5a96c5d2a6fdccecff0a37df/Hesperidin-an-antioxidant-flavonoid-prevents-acrylonitrile-induced-oxidative-stress-in-rat-brain.pdf,0,0,0

1054650,Copeptin: a neuroendocrine biomarker in acute myocardial infarction,2013,Ahmed Elshafei and Gamil Abdalla and Ossama Abd El-Motaal and Tarek Salman,,Annual Research & Review in Biology,,1040-1054,,Copeptin is a novel neuroendocrine peptide recently introduced to the field of acute medicine biomarkers. It is 39 amino acids glycopeptide cosynthesized with arginine vasopressin (AVP) and released together in stoichiometric pattern from the hypothalamus upon stimulation of AVP release. Due to difficulties of AVP assay. copeptin largely replaced it in clinical assay as surrogate biomarker because copeptin has easier and more valid measurement methods. In acute stress condition. copeptin rises and reflects stress level exactly like AVP which was largely known as mediator of non-specific stress conditions beside its prominent role in water homeostasis. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an acute stress state in which plasma copeptin rises. Early identification of AMI is a problem due to the delayed appearance of the cardiospecific troponins which start to rise within 6-9 hours from the onset of chest pain. In the recent years many studies concluded that. when copeptin is combined with cardiac troponins in diagnosis of patients presenting with acute chest pain in early hours. it accelerates early rule in of AMI and rule out of non-MI patients. This review article discusses the biochemical and physiological basics of copeptin beside its clinical diagnostic value in AMI according to results and conclusions of some studies carried out on copeptin in AMI diagnostic field.,True,P_wb79MAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,13,http://www.journalarrb.com/index.php/ARRB/article/view/25001,7163718999822199907,/scholar?cites=7163718999822199907,,http://www.journalarrb.com/index.php/ARRB/article/download/25001/46768,0,0,0

In response to several stresses and during photorespiration plants use reactive oxygen species as signaling molecules. The Arabidopsis thaliana catalase2 (cat2) mutant lacks a peroxisomal catalase and under photorespiratory conditions accumulates H2O2. which leads to activation of cell death. A cat2 double mutant collection was generated through crossing and scored for cell death in different assays. Selected double mutants were further analyzed for photosynthetic performance and H2O2 accumulation. We used a targeted mutant analysis with more than 50 cat2 double mutants to investigate the role of stress hormones and other defense regulators in H2O2-mediated cell death.

1054660,Stress marker signatures in lesion mimic single and double mutants identify a crucial leaf age-dependent salicylic acid related defense signal,2017,Eve Kaurilind and Mikael Brosche,12,Plos one,1,e0170532,Public Library of Science,Plants are exposed to abiotic and biotic stress conditions throughout their lifespans that activates various defense programs. Programmed cell death (PCD) is an extreme defense strategy the plant uses to manage unfavorable environments as well as during developmentally induced senescence. Here we investigated the role of leaf age on the regulation of defense gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Two lesion mimic mutants with misregulated cell death. catalase2 (cat2) and defense no death1 (dnd1) were used together with several double mutants to dissect signaling pathways regulating defense gene expression associated with cell death and leaf age. PCD marker genes showed leaf age dependent expression. with the highest expression in old leaves. The salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis mutant salicylic acid induction deficient2 (sid2) had reduced expression of PCD marker genes in the cat2 sid2 double mutant demonstrating the importance of SA biosynthesis in regulation of defense gene expression. While the auxin- and jasmonic acid (JA)- insensitive auxin resistant1 (axr1) double mutant cat2 axr1 also led to decreased expression of PCD markers; the expression of several marker genes for SA signaling (ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1. PR1 and PR2) were additionally decreased in cat2 axr1 compared to cat2. The reduced expression of these SA markers genes in cat2 axr1 implicates AXR1 as a regulator of SA signaling in addition to its known role in auxin and JA signaling.

1054674,An overview of the biodiversity and biogeography of terrestrial green algae,2009,Fabio Rindi and Haj A Allali and Daryl W Lam and Juan M López-Bautista,125,Biodiversity hotspots,,,Nova Science Publishers,Microscopic green algae are among the most widespread microrganisms occurring in terrestrial environments. For more than two centuries. generalizations on the diversity and biogeography of these organisms have been based entirely on morphological species concepts. However. ultrastructural and molecular data produced in the last 30 years have revealed a scenario in substantial contrast with morphological classifications. It has become clear that these organisms have been affected by an extreme morphological convergence. which has restricted their morphology to a narrow range. not indicative of their great genetic diversity. Their habit is very simple and uniform. usually referable to a few types (unicellular. uniseriate filamentous. sarcinoid colony) and offers very few characters useful for taxonomic and systematic purposes. These factors make the identification of terrestrial green algae and a correct interpretation of their biogeography very difficult.“Flagship” taxa with easily recognizable habit are the ones for which the best generalizations are possible. Examples of such taxa include the order Trentepohliales (for the highest diversity occurs in humid tropical regions of central-south America and south-eastern Asia) and members of the order Prasiolales (which are typically associated with polar and cold-temperate regions). In consideration of the recent developments. it is clear that many basic concepts about the biogeography of terrestrial green algae will have to be reconsidered critically. A deep understanding of this topic will require considerable work on many aspects of the biology of these organisms (systematics. distribution. dispersal …,True,dtjHHkIAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,72,http://nadre.ethernet.edu.et/record/1189/files/BiodiversityHotspotgeog.pdf#page=121,7701865120837847930,/scholar?cites=7701865120837847930,,http://nadre.ethernet.edu.et/record/1189/files/BiodiversityHotspotgeog.pdf#page=121,0,0,0

Chlorophyta) and comparative analyses of siphonous green seaweed plastomes,2016,Daryl W Lam and Juan M Lopez-Bautista,2,Cymbella,,23-32,,The green algal order Bryopsidales is mostly comprised of large conspicuous siphonous seaweeds. From this green algal order. a de novo chloroplast genome was sequenced for Caulerpa racemosa. The plastid genome was circular and lacked the inverted repeat commonly found in vascular green plants. The C. racemosa genome was 176.522 base pairs long and represents the largest plastid genome currently known for the Bryopsidales. Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses were performed with the addition of previously published bryopsidalean plastome data. Overall. the genome contained a similar gene complement to other bryopsidalean species. However. C. racemosa was missing the ycf47 gene that encodes for PP-bond-hydrolysis-driven amino acid involved in protein translocation across the thylakoid membrane. Phylogenomic analysis. based on a 50-gene dataset. supported the current taxonomy for C. racemosa and was similar to previously published Bryopsidales phylogenies. Specifically. the monophyly of suborders Bryopsidineae and Halimedineae was strongly supported. Mauve based synteny analyses suggested several genomic rearrangement events in both suborders. Overall. there were more rearrangements in the Halimedineae as compared to the Bryopsidineae. When compared to other species of this order. the larger genome size of C. racemosa was due to more abundant and longer introns. more intergenic space. and the presence of large open reading frames (ORFs).

Both patients presented with retrosternal pain. odynophagia and dysphagia. Symptoms developed after 3 days of treatment with doxycycline in patient 1 and after 3 months of treatment with alendronate in patient 2. Endoscopy revealed ulcerative lesions in the mid-esophagus. sparing the distal esophagus. Biopsies showed inflammatory infiltrate (patient 1) and ulceration and hyperplastic cells (patient 2).

Results: Eleven papers studied the role of gray-scale and Doppler ultrasound and two further studies analyzed the relationship between liver stiffness and staging of esophageal varices. The parameters that proved to be valuable for diagnosis of esophageal varices and reached statistcal significance were: diameter of the spleen> 15 cm. congestion index of the portal vein> 0.154 cm× sec. portal hipertensive index> 2.08. liver stiffness> 43.97 kPa. portal vein diameter> 13 mm. renal artery resistance index≥ 0.7 and development of new porto-systemic collaterals.

The coexistence of multiple male and/or female morphs is widely believed to be maintained through negative frequency-dependent selection imposed by social interactions. However. remarkably few empirical studies have evaluated how social interactions. morph frequencies and fitness parameters relate to one another under natural conditions. Here. we test two hypotheses proposed to explain the maintenance of a female polymorphism in a species with extreme geographical variation in morph frequencies. We first elucidate how fecundity traits of the morphs vary in relation to the frequencies and densities of males and female morphs in multiple sites over multiple years. Second. we evaluate whether the two female morphs differ in resource allocation among fecundity traits. indicating alternative tactics to maximize reproductive output. We present some of the first empirical evidence collected under natural conditions that egg number and clutch mass was higher in the rarer female morph. This morph-specific fecundity advantage gradually switched with the population morph frequency. Our results further indicate that all investigated fecundity traits are negatively affected by relative male density (i.e. operational sex ratio). which confirms male harassment as selective agent. Finally. we show a clear trade-off between qualitative (egg mass) and quantitative (egg number) fecundity traits. This trade-off. however. is not morph-specific.

Here. for the first time. we test whether mimetic fidelity varies with mimic/model ratios in an intraspecific mimicry system. in which signal receivers are the same species as the mimics and models.

This phenomenon is commonly observed in damselfly species where the coexistence of different female colour morphs is often explained in the context of sexual conflict.

A case in point is the widespread North American damselfly Nehalennia irene. in which one female morph occurs predominantly in populations in Western Canada. while another morph is more common in Eastern Canada.

We present a significant link between the difference in lithology of these levels and elasmobranch community structure. In general. selachians are notably more common in clayey levels. while batoids predominate in sandy levels.

To understand the contribution of selective factors in maintaining polymorphism. we investigated large-scale (>1000 km) geographic variation in morph frequencies and fitness-related physiological traits in the damselfly Nehalennia irene. As fitness-related physiological traits. we investigated investment in immune function (phenoloxidase activity). energy storage and fecundity (abdomen protein and lipid content). and flight muscles (thorax protein content). In the first part of the study. our aim was to identify selective agents maintaining the large-scale spatial variation in morph frequencies. Morph frequencies varied considerably among populations. but. in contrast to expectation. in a geographically unstructured way. Furthermore. frequencies co-varied only weakly with the numerous investigated ecological parameters. This suggests that spatial frequency patterns are driven by stochastic processes. or alternatively. are consequence of highly variable and currently unidentified ecological conditions.

Ischnura elegans: No differences between female morphs,2011,Niels Bouton and Arne Iserbyt and Hans Van Gossum,11,Journal of Insect Science,1,112,Oxford University Press,Female polymorphism is observed in various animal species. but is particularly common in damselflies. The maintenance of this polymorphism has traditionally been explained from frequency and density dependent sexual conflict. however. the role of abiotic factors has recently attracted more interest. Here. the role of ambient temperature in shaping life-history was investigated for the three female morphs of Ischnura elegans (Vander Linden) (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae). Eggs were obtained from the three mature female morphs for two populations in the Netherlands. Using a split-brood design. eggs of both populations were divided between a cold and a warm treatment group in the laboratory. and egg survival and hatching time were measured. Significant thermal plasticity was found in both hatching time and egg survival between both temperature treatments.

1054717,Regulation of transcription by Ultraviolet-B radiation in Arabidopsis thaliana,2015,Christos N Velanis,,,,,,Plants are sessile photo-autotrophic organisms and need to adapt constantly to a dynamic environment. Light is of utmost importance for plants to be able to monitor their surroundings. Ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B; 280-315 nm) is an intrinsic part of sunlight and. depending on the wavelength and the fluence rate. it may be a stressful signal or an “informational” one. The so called photomorphogenic responses of plants to UV-B are largely mediated by the UV-B specific photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8). which “senses” UV-B via a tryptophan based mechanism.  UVR8 is localised in the cytoplasm and the nucleus mainly as a homodimer. Upon UV-B irradiation it splits to its monomers and accumulates in the nucleus where it has been found to interact with the E3 Ubiquitin ligase COP1. In the nucleus UVR8 has been shown to associate with chromatin on loci of UV-B responsive genes. including  that encoding for the bZIP transcription factor (TF) ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5).  a key effector of UVR8-dependent signalling pathways. The binding of UVR8 to chromatin appears to take place via interaction with histones (H2B in particular) rather than DNA itself. However. this association with chromatin seems not to be UV-B specific. The above data suggest a mechanistic basis for an assumed function of UVR8 in the regulation transcription. It seems likely that UVR8 interacts with other proteins associated with chromatin to promote remodelling and/or recruits/activates TFs which in turn stimulate transcription of its target genes. The main objective of this study was to address the above working hypothesis.,True,rRFpq4kAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,http://theses.gla.ac.uk/6204/,,,,,0,0,0

1054718,Zebrafish larvae exhibit rheotaxis and can escape a continuous suction source using their lateral line,2012,Julia Olszewski and Melanie Haehnel and Masashige Taguchi and James C Liao,7,PloS one,5,e36661,Public Library of Science,Zebrafish larvae show a robust behavior called rheotaxis. whereby they use their lateral line system to orient upstream in the presence of a steady current. At 5 days post fertilization. rheotactic larvae can detect and initiate a swimming burst away from a continuous point-source of suction. Burst distance and velocity increase when fish initiate bursts closer to the suction source where flow velocity is higher. We suggest that either the magnitude of the burst reflects the initial flow stimulus. or fish may continually sense flow during the burst to determine where to stop. By removing specific neuromasts of the posterior lateral line along the body. we show how the location and number of flow sensors play a role in detecting a continuous suction source. We show that the burst response critically depends on the presence of neuromasts on the tail. Flow information relayed by neuromasts appears to be involved in the selection of appropriate behavioral responses. We hypothesize that caudally located neuromasts may be preferentially connected to fast swimming spinal motor networks while rostrally located neuromasts are connected to slow swimming motor networks at an early age.,True,gY9KMZYAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,73,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036661,3578700222464113643,/scholar?cites=3578700222464113643,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036661,0,0,0

We performed patch-clamp recordings of afferent neurons that contact neuromasts in the posterior lateral line of anesthetized. transgenic larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) to show that larger cells are born earlier. have a lower input resistance. a lower spontaneous firing rate. and tend to contact multiple neuromasts …,True,gY9KMZYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,40,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.01108.2011,7729285335823615911,/scholar?cites=7729285335823615911,,https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.01108.2011,0,0,0

The ability to sense flow informs many behaviors. such as schooling. predator avoidance. and rheotaxis. Here. we developed a new approach to stimulate individual neuromasts while either recording primary sensory afferent neuron activity or swimming motoneuron activity in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Our results allowed us to characterize the transfer functions between a controlled lateral line stimulus. its representation by primary sensory neurons. and its subsequent behavioral output. When we deflected the cupula of a neuromast with a ramp command. we found that the connected afferent neuron exhibited an adapting response which was proportional in strength to deflection velocity.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The lateral line system of larval zebrafish is emerging as a model to study a range of topics in neurobiology. from hair cell regeneration to sensory processing. However. despite numerous studies detailing the patterning and development of lateral line neuromasts. little is known about the organization of their connections to afferent neurons and targets in the hindbrain. We found that as fish grow and neuromasts proliferate over the body surface. the number of afferent neurons increases linearly. The number of afferents innervating certain neuromasts increases over time. while it decreases for other neuromasts. The ratio of afferent neurons to neuromasts differs between the anterior and posterior lateral line system. suggesting potential differences in sensitivity threshold or spatial resolution.

In the larval zebrafish. they are likely the only source of central dopaminergic projections to the periphery. Here. we characterized posterior tubercular dopaminergic fibers projecting to peripheral sense organs. with a focus on the lateral line neuromasts. We labelled and identified catecholaminergic neurons and their projections by combining two immunofluorescence techniques. (i) using an antibody against Tyrosine hydroxylase. and (ii) using an antibody against GFP in transgenic zebrafish expressing in catecholaminergic neurons either membrane-anchored GFP to track fibers. or a Synaptophysin-GFP fusion to visualize putative synapses. We applied the CLARITY method to six days old whole zebrafish larvae to stain and analyze dopaminergic projections by confocal microscopy. We found that all lateral line neuromasts receive direct innervation by posterior tubercular dopaminergic neurons. and tracked these projections in detail. In addition. we found dopaminergic fibers projecting to the anterior and posterior lateral line ganglia. and extensive central dopaminergic arborizations around the terminal projection field of the lateral line afferent neurons in the hindbrain medial octavolateralis nucleus. Therefore. dopaminergic innervation may affect lateral line sense information at different processing stages.

In humans. this proliferation barrier constitutes a tumor suppressor mechanism and may be involved in cellular aging. Yet the heterogeneity of the senescence phenotype has hindered the understanding of its onset. Here we investigated the regulation of telomere length and its control of senescence heterogeneity. Because the length of the shortest telomeres can potentially regulate cell fate. we focus on their dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed a stochastic model of telomere dynamics built on the protein-counting model. where an increasing number of protein-bound telomeric repeats shift telomeres into a nonextendable state by telomerase.

To prevent neuronal hyperexcitability. potassium ions have to be taken up quickly. However. the dynamics of the activity-dependent potassium fluxes and the molecular pathways underlying extracellular potassium homeostasis remain elusive. To decipher the specific and acute contribution of astroglial Kir4.1 channels in controlling potassium homeostasis and the moment to moment neurotransmission. we built a tri-compartment model accounting for potassium dynamics between neurons. astrocytes and the extracellular space. We here demonstrate that astroglial Kir4.1 channels are sufficient to account for the slow membrane depolarization of hippocampal astrocytes and crucially contribute to extracellular potassium clearance during basal and high activity. By quantifying the dynamics of potassium levels in neuron-glia-extracellular space compartments. we show that astrocytes buffer within 6 to 9 seconds more than 80% of the potassium released by neurons in response to basal. repetitive and tetanic stimulations. Astroglial Kir4.1 channels directly lead to recovery of basal extracellular potassium levels and neuronal excitability. especially during repetitive stimulation. thereby preventing the generation of epileptiform activity. Remarkably. we also show that Kir4.1 channels strongly regulate neuronal excitability for slow 3 to 10 Hz rhythmic activity resulting from probabilistic firing activity induced by sub-firing stimulation coupled to Brownian noise. Altogether. these data suggest that astroglial Kir4.1 channels are crucially involved in extracellular …,True,1-DQPzQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,57,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004137,16478505217616429900,/scholar?cites=16478505217616429900,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004137,0,0,0

To dissect quantitatively the different determinants of elongation speed. we use probabilistic modeling to estimate initiation and local elongation rates from ribosome profiling data. This model-based approach allows us to quantify the extent of interference between ribosomes on the same transcript. We show that neither interference nor the distribution of slow codons is sufficient to explain the observed heterogeneity. Instead. we find that electrostatic interactions between the ribosomal exit tunnel and specific parts of the nascent polypeptide govern the elongation rate variation as the polypeptide makes its initial pass through the tunnel. Once the N-terminus has escaped the tunnel. the hydropathy of the nascent polypeptide within the ribosome plays a major role in modulating the speed. We show that our results are consistent with the biophysical properties of the tunnel.,True,1-DQPzQAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,50,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007166,689526539648587182,/scholar?cites=689526539648587182,,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007166,0,0,0

A common paradigm in tensor-related algorithms advocates unfolding (or flattening) the tensor into a matrix and applying classical methods developed for matrices. Despite the popularity of such techniques. how the functional properties of a tensor changes upon unfolding is currently not well understood. In contrast to the body of existing work which has focused almost exclusively on matricizations. we here consider all possible unfoldings of an order-k tensor. which are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of partitions of {1.…. k}.

Yet the underlying mechanism driving these periods remain unclear. We show here within a mean-field model that the residence times of the neuronal membrane potential in cortical Up states does not follow a Poissonian law. but presents several peaks. Furthermore. the present modeling approach allows extracting some information about the neuronal network connectivity from the time distribution histogram. Based on a synaptic-depression model. we find that these peaks. that can be observed in histograms of patch-clamp recordings are not artifacts of electrophysiological measurements. but rather are an inherent property of the network dynamics. Analysis of the equations reveals a stable focus located close to the unstable limit cycle. delimiting a region that defines the Up state. The model further shows that the peaks observed in the Up state time distribution are due to winding around the focus before escaping from the basin of attraction. Finally. we use in vivo recordings of intracellular membrane potential and we recover from the peak distribution. some information about the network connectivity. We conclude that it is possible to recover the network connectivity from the distribution of times that the neuronal membrane voltage spends in Up states.,True,1-DQPzQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,15,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00096/full,11758091712098107179,/scholar?cites=11758091712098107179,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00096/full,0,0,0

We suppose that prey migration is dependent on predator density. according to a general function. We consider two different time scales in the dynamics of the model. a fast one describing patch to patch migration. and a slow one involving local prey and predator interaction. We take advantage of the time scales to reduce the dimension of the model by use of methods of aggregation of variables. and thereby examine the effect of predator density-dependent migration of prey on the stability of the predator–prey system.

Although this model has been widely studied in the past. the extent of collision between particles and the average distance between a particle to its nearest neighbor have not been quantified explicitly. We provide here a theoretical analysis of such quantities via the distribution of isolated particles.

1054738,Using default constraints of the spindle assembly checkpoint to estimate the associated chemical rates,2012,Khanh Dao Duc and David Holcman,5,BMC biophysics,1,1-11,BioMed Central,Default activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint provides severe constraints on the underlying biochemical activation rates: on one hand. the cell cannot divide before all chromosomes are aligned. but on the other hand. when they are ready. the separation is quite fast. lasting a few minutes. Our purpose is to use these opposed constraints to estimate the associated chemical rates. To analyze the above constraints. we develop a markovian model to describe the dynamics of Cdc20 molecules. We compute the probability for no APC/C activation before time t. the distribution of Cdc20 at equilibrium and the mean time to complete APC/C activation after all chromosomes are attached. By studying Cdc20 inhibition and the activation time. we obtain a range for the main chemical reaction rates regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint and transition to anaphase.,True,1-DQPzQAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,12,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2046-1682-5-1,4033788167362671602,/scholar?cites=4033788167362671602,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2046-1682-5-1,0,0,0

1054739,The key parameters that govern translation efficiency,2020,Dan D Erdmann-Pham and Khanh Dao Duc and Yun S Song,10,Cell systems,2,183-192. e6,Cell Press,Translation of mRNA into protein is a fundamental yet complex biological process with multiple factors that can potentially affect its efficiency. Here. we study a stochastic model describing the traffic flow of ribosomes along the mRNA and identify the key parameters that govern the overall rate of protein synthesis. sensitivity to initiation rate changes. and efficiency of ribosome usage. By analyzing a continuum limit of the model. we obtain closed-form expressions for stationary currents and ribosomal densities. which agree well with Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore. we completely characterize the phase transitions in the system. and by applying our theoretical results. we formulate design principles that detail how to tune the key parameters we identified to optimize translation efficiency. Using ribosome profiling data from S. cerevisiae. we show that its translation system is generally consistent with these principles …,True,1-DQPzQAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,11,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471219304648,5347548504026416432,/scholar?cites=5347548504026416432,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05609,0,0,0

After we collected several specimens identified as I. seladonium. we decided to redescribe this species and discovered that the male. previously described as belonging to this species. was misidentified by MELLO LEITÃO (1923). Thus. in this paper the male of I. seladonium is newly described and the reproductive organs of male and female are described and illustrated in detail. Notes on the behavior and natural history of I. seladonium are presented based on the observation of live specimens in the field and in captivity. An immature of I. seladonium was observed constructing a hinged retreat with silk and little pieces of bark. a behavior not previously seen for other Aviculariinae. Two courtship events were observed and photographed. leg tapping and palpal drumming of the male on female's body and dorsum-ventral movements of the female's abdomen while the male was inserting the embolus were documented to Aviculariinae for the first time.

Goeldia is the only genus of Titanoecidae with species in the Neotropical region and includes eight species diagnosed by the presence of a patellar process in the male palp. The new species. Goeldia zyngierae sp. nov.. was found living inside the Casa de Pedra cave. Ribeira. Itabaiana. Sergipe. Brazil. Goeldia zyngierae sp. nov. is diagnosed by the tegular process with a small constriction near the base of the dorsal part and by a distal narrowing. more visible in the dorsal side of the patellar process of the male palp. The female epigynum shows a pair of sinuous depressions and a large mid field that does not close the copulatory openings as in Goeldia luteipes Keyserling. 1878. The vulva presents a narrow and straight copulatory duct in comparison with those of Goeldia mexicana Pickard-Cambridge. 1896 and a narrow spermathecae. The description includes illustrations of the genital organs. measurements of the body and legs and leg spination. Notes on the natural history show that inside the cave the spiders live farther than the first 40 m. in the aphotic zone. under stones or on the wall. They were never observed alone or walking on the ground. and the webs contained two to thirty spiders of different life stages. living together. suggesting a possible cooperative behavior.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) participate in tissue repair processes and may have a role during impaired wound healing. In this study. autologous transplantation of ASCs was used to determine if it increases angiogenesis and skin graft survival and enhances wound healing in diabetic rats.MethodsAdipose-derived stem cells were successfully isolated and cultured.

The in vitro isolation and expansion of MSCs involve the use of foetal bovine serum (FBS). However. many concerns have been raised regarding the safety of this product. In this study. alternative additives derived either from peripheral or cord blood were tested as an FBS replacement. Methods: Platelet lysates (PL) from peripheral and cord blood were used for the expansion of MSCs. The levels of growth factors in peripheral blood (PB) and cord blood (CB) PLs were determined using the Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM). Finally. the cell doubling time (CDT). tri-lineage differentiation and phenotypic characterization of the MSCs expanded with FBS and PLs were determined. Results: MSCs treated with culture media containing FBS and PB-PL. were successfully isolated and expanded. whereas MSCs treated with CB-PL could not be maintained in culture. Furthermore. the MRM analysis yielded differences in growth factor levels between PB-PL and CB-PL. In addition. the MSCs were successfully expanded with FBS and PB-PL and exhibited tri-lineage differentiation and stable phenotypic characteristics. Conclusion: PB-PL could be used as an alternative additive for the production of MSCs culture medium applied to xenogeneic-free expansion and maintenance of MSCs in large scale clinical studies.

A cord blood bank (CBB) must ensure that the final product of transplantation is represented accurately from quality control (QC) products of the UCB unit. The use of a tube segment attached to the UCB unit as well as a separate 1.8 mL cryovial containing an identical aliquot of the cryopreserved UCB unit product was exposed to the same post-processing freezing and storage conditions as the UCB unit. Eventually. the utility of the attached segment and the 1.8 mL cryovial was evaluated as valid QC tools in order the final UCB unit graft to be validated.Methods: A total of 30 cord blood (CB) units. stored in liquid nitrogen. with their attached segments and 1.8 mL cryovials were thawed and several QC parameters (total nucleated cells (TNCs).

1054772,GlnR-mediated regulation of short-chain fatty acid assimilation in Mycobacterium smegmatis,2018,Xin-Xin Liu and Meng-Jia Shen and Wei-Bing Liu and Bang-Ce Ye,9,Frontiers in microbiology,,1311,Frontiers,Assimilation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) plays an important role in the survival and lipid biosynthesis of Mycobacteria. However. regulation of this process has not been thoroughly described. In the present work. we demonstrate that GlnR as a well-known nitrogen-sensing regulator transcriptionally modulates the AMP-forming propionyl-CoA synthetase (MsPrpE). and acetyl-CoA synthetases (MsAcs) is associated with SCFAs assimilation in Mycobacterium smegmatis. a model Mycobacterium. GlnR can directly activate the expression of MsprpE and Msacs by binding to their promoter regions based upon sensed nitrogen starvation in the host. Moreover. GlnR can activate the expression of lysine acetyltransferase encoding Mspat. which significantly decreases the activity of MsPrpE and MsAcs through increased acylation. Next. growth curves and resazurin assay show that GlnR can further regulate the growth of M. smegmatis on different SCFAs to control the viability. These results demonstrate that GlnR-mediated regulation of SCFA assimilation in response to the change of nitrogen signal serves to control the survival of M. smegmatis. These findings provide insights into the survival and nutrient utilization mechanisms of Mycobacteria in their host. which may enable new strategies in drug discovery for the control of tuberculosis.,True,gPcmgVsAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,13,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01311/full,9789251630337482098,/scholar?cites=9789251630337482098,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01311/full,0,0,0

Given evidence and anticipated impacts of climate variability. this is especially true with respect to sea ice and its role in animal life history in northern regions. We examined relationships between the extent of consolidated spring ice cover (pack and landfast). nest initiation and clutch size in common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in northern Labrador. a sub-Arctic region on the east coast of Canada. Our initial prediction was that eiders would delay nesting and have smaller clutches in years with more extensive spring ice cover. Between 1998 and 2003. we surveyed coastal islands for breeding eiders and collected information on nest age and clutch size. For those years. we estimated ice cover based on Radarsat-1 images supplied by the Canadian Ice …,True,bjhMGdEAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,17,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-011-1110-2.pdf,2455358497163505755,/scholar?cites=2455358497163505755,,,0,0,0

The special role of gNPs is related to antibacterial agents. fluorescent markers and carriers for drug delivery. However. application of gNPs for construction of amperometric biosensors (ABSs) is not well documented. The aim of the current research was to study potential advantages of using gNPs in biosensorics. The extracellular metabolites of the yeast Ogataea polymorpha were used as reducing agents for obtaining gNPs from the corresponding inorganic ions. Several gNPs were synthesized. characterized and tested as enzyme carriers on the surface of graphite electrodes (GEs). The most effective were Pd-based gNPs (gPdNPs). and these were studied further and applied for construction of laccase-and alcohol oxidase (AO)-based ABSs. AO/GE. AO-gPdNPs/GE. laccase/GE and laccase-gPdNPs/GE were obtained. and their analytical characteristics were studied. Both gPdNPs-modified ABSs were found to have broader linear ranges and higher storage stabilities than control electrodes. although they are less sensitive toward corresponding substrates. We thus conclude that gPdNPs may be promising for construction of ABSs for enzymes with very high affinities to their substrates.

It was shown that selectivity for the target analyte could be increased by modulating the working electrode potential. Analytical parameters of three variants of the amperometric analyzer that differed in the chemical structure/configuration of the working electrode were studied. The constructed analyzer was tested on wastewater solutions that contained formaldehyde. A simple low-cost biosensor was developed for semi-quantitative detection of airborne formaldehyde in concentrations exceeding the threshold level. This biosensor is based on a change in the color of a solution that contains a mixture of alcohol oxidase from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. horseradish peroxidase and a chromogen. following exposure to airborne formaldehyde. The solution is enclosed within a membrane device. which is permeable to formaldehyde vapors. The most efficient and sensitive biosensor for detecting formaldehyde was the one that contained alcohol oxidase with an activity of 1.2 U· mL− 1.

1054813,Study of sedation. pre-anesthetic and anti-anxiety effects of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) extract compared with diazepam in rats,2012,Ramin Shishehgar and Ali Rezaie and Mehrdad Nazeri,,Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances,,,Medwell Online,Humulus lupulus (hops) is a climbing perennial vine that vigorously grows 20-35 feet each year. Humulus lupulus is a member of the hemp family which has grown wild since ancient times in Europe. Asia and North America. The female flowers mature in late Summer and are used to add bitterness. flavor and aroma to beer. In ancient times the young shoots were eaten as a vegetable and the dried flowers were used for their slight narcotic effect and sedative action in the treatment of mania. toothache. earache and neuralgia. One modern herbal medicine practitioners continue to use hops as a sedative and mild hypnotic as well as for its endocrine. free radical scavenging and antitumor properties. The aim of this study was to investigation of the sedation. pre-anesthetic and anti-anxiety effects of hop (Humulus lupulus L.) extract compared with diazepam in rats. In the present study 30 wistar male rats weighting 300±10 g and about 3 months old were used for laboratory experiments. In order to evaluate the sedation and pre-anesthetic effects of hop extract compared with diazepam. 50 mg kg-1 of extract in 1st group. 100 mg kg-1 in 2nd group. 1.2 mg kg-1 in 3rd group. 2 mg kg-1 in Group 4th. 2 mg kg-1 amount of dimethyl sulfoxide was injected intra peritoneal in 5th group and 6th group did not receive any drug.

Oxidative stress is currently suggested as a mechanism underlying diabetes mellitus complications. The present study was designed to assess the liver injury as a complication of diabetes mellitus and to evaluate the hepaoprotective properties of ethanolic extract of Saffron (dried stigmas of Crocus sativus L.) in streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. Aminotransferases. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) were measured to determine the concentration of intracellular hepatic enzymes that have leaked into the circulation and serve as a marker of hepatocyte injury. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin were measured to assess biliary function. Albumin was measured to reflect liver synthetic function. The lipid peroxidation product. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced Glutathione (GSH) content was measured to assess free radical activity in the liver tissues. The enzymatic activities of Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-Px). Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT) were measured as indicators of antioxidation in liver tissue. Moreover. histopathological observations were assayed at the degree of hepatic injury. For this purpose. male Wistar rats were made diabetic with a single injection of STZ (75 mg kg-1 ip).

This study was designed to investigate the effect of pre-treatment with Turnip root ethanolic extract (TREE) on kidney histopathology and function markers in renal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) induced injury in the rats. A total of 80 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham. IR model and two I/R+ TREE (1% and 2%)-treated groups (n= 20 per group). I/R groups’ kidneys were subjected to 60 min of global ischemia at 37 C followed by 30 min of reperfusion. After 24h of reperfusion period. the rats were sacrificed. Kidney function tests and histopathological examination were also performed. Results were compared with a group of rats with sham operation. High serum creatinine. blood urea nitrogen and uric acid were observed in I/R rats compared to the sham rats. Pre-treatment of TREE extracts for 30 days prior to IR operation improved renal function. reduced IR induced renal inflammatory and oxidative injury.

Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) is used as a choice treatment in many superficial burn wounds. But. some studies have questioned its efficacy. The main objective of this study was to compare the effects of normal saline (NS) and SSD on healing of superficial skin burn wounds in rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned in two different groups including treatment and control. with 20 animals each. After sedation. a type II skin burn wound in the shape of a 1-cm diameter circle was created in the dorsum of the rats with boiled water contact. In treatment group. NS and in control group. SSD was used topically for care. Diameter of the wound as well as the hair growing grade was determined on days 3. 7 and 14 post-intervention. In each step of the experiment. histopathological sections were prepared; thereafter reepithelialization and alleviation of inflammation at the healing site of burn wound were assessed. Statistically. the data obtained were compared between the groups. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the mean diameter of the wound on days 3 and 14 (p= 0.089. p= 0.495). The mean diameter of the wound was significantly lower in treatment (NS) group on day 7 (p< 0.001). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding the mean hair growth score in different stages of the experiment (p= 1. p= 0.647. p= 0.805).

Tests that are based on indirect immunofluorescence method (IF). are easy and fast. The aim of this study was the comparison of culturing of amniotic fluid with the indirect IF of serum antibody in abortion and preterm labor. In this study 518 aborted mothers or preterm labor were included. Exclusion criteria were the patients who had been suspicious to non-infectious etiology. The blood and amniotic fluid was obtained in sterile way as specimens. The blood specimen used for indirect IF test and amniotic fluid for microbial culturing. Five hundred and twelve patients completed the inclusion criteria. The age of mothers was between 19 to 42 years with the mean age of 29.83. Twenty-nine patients (5.66%) had preterm labor and 483 (94.33%) patients were aborted. In indirect IF. 6 patients (1.17%) revealed titer of 1: 400 and greater for L. monocytogenes. In culturing method. in 77 cases (15.03%) amniotic fluids showed positive results. From these. 5 (0.97%) confirmed for L. monocytogenes but 6 cases were positive in IF. In the comparison with gold standard method of culture method. the indirect IF had 100% sensitivity but had 87.8% specificity. Indirect IF should be confirmed by culturing of infected specimens.

From an evolutionary perspective. there is evidence that pesticide tolerance can be achieved via two mechanisms: selection for constitutive tolerance over multiple generations or by inducing tolerance within a single generation via phenotypic plasticity. While both mechanisms can allow organisms to persist in contaminated environments. they might result in different performance trade‐offs including population susceptibility to parasites. We have identified 15 wood frog populations that exist along a gradient from close to agriculture and high. constitutive pesticide tolerance to far from agriculture and inducible pesticide tolerance.

We hypothesized those strategies of endogenous osmolytes proline. glycine betaine and choline accumulation in moderately halophilic bacterial strains Staphylococcus haemolyticus (ST-9) and Bacillus subtilis RH-4 isolated from saline rhizosphere have a role in improving bacterial and plant growth by alleviating salt stress. We checked the effect of varying salt stress (0. 0.5. 1. 1.5. 2. 2.5 M NaCl) on bacterial growth and osmolyte accumulation. The data showed that bacterial growth was affected by increasing salt stress however. cells cultured in the presence of 1.5 M NaCl stress showed higher accumulation of osmolytes.

We hypothesized that two previously isolated salt tolerant strains.

These strains can favour plant growth due to their endogenous osmolyte accumulation. To ascertain this. strains were checked for osmolyte accumulation under salt stress. Growth and osmolyte accumulation of inoculated and non-inoculated seeds of the economically significant plant. Zea mays Var. EV. 90. was recorded. Seeds were sown in soil supplemented with and without exogenous proline and glycine betaine and salt stress for 15 days. The results show that strains can accumulate osmolytes (preferably glycine betaine) at higher salt stress. Inoculation and exogenous osmolytes (10 mM) improved the plant growth at higher salt stress. However. concurrent application had an amplified effect. Endogenous level of osmolyte (preferably glycine betaine) on the fresh weight basis was significantly higher and improved bacterial and plant growth under stress.

We here demonstrate a new imaging approach. called asymmetric-detection time-stretch optical microscopy (ATOM). which can deliver ultrafast label-free high-contrast flow imaging with well delineated cellular morphological resolution and in-line optical image amplification to overcome the compromised imaging sensitivity at high speed. We show that ATOM can separately reveal the enhanced phase-gradient and absorption contrast in microfluidic live-cell imaging at a flow speed as high as~ 10 m/s. corresponding to an imaging throughput of~ 100.000 cells/sec.

Artificial cells are defined as the encapsulation of biologically active material in a biological or synthetic membrane.

A microfluidic double emulsion system is used to encapsulate a mammalian cell-free expression system that is able to express membrane proteins into the bilayer or soluble proteins inside the vesicles.

There have been limited studies of using mammalian cell-free expression (CFE) system as the ‘cytosol’ of artificial cells. We exploit glass capillary droplet microfluidics for the encapsulation of mammalian CFE within double emulsion templated vesicles. The complexity of the physicochemical properties of HeLa cell-free lysate poses a challenge compared with encapsulating simple buffer solutions. In particular. we discovered the formation of aggregates in double emulsion templated vesicles encapsulating mammalian HeLa CFE. but not with bacterial CFE. The aggregates did not arise from insolubility of the proteins made from CFE nor due to the interaction of mammalian CFE with the organic solvents in the middle phase of the double emulsions. We found that aggregation is dependent on the concentration of poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) surfactant. a critical double emulsion-stabilizing surfactant. and the lysate concentration in mammalian CFE. Despite vesicle instability and reduced protein expression. we demonstrate protein expression by encapsulating mammalian CFE system. Using mass spectrometry and Western blot. we identified and verified that actin is one of the proteins inside the mammalian CFE that aggregated with PVA surfactant.

1054850,Advanced microfluidic device designed for cyclic compression of single adherent cells,2018,Kenneth KY Ho and Ying Lin Wang and Jing Wu and Allen P Liu,6,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,,148,Frontiers,Cells in our body experience different types of stress including compression. tension. and shear. It has been shown that some cells experience permanent plastic deformation after a mechanical tensile load was removed. However. it was unclear whether cells are plastically deformed after repetitive compressive loading and unloading. There have been few tools available to exert cyclic compression at the single cell level. To address technical challenges found in a previous microfluidic compression device. we developed a new single-cell microfluidic compression device that combines an elastomeric membrane block geometry to ensure a flat contact surface and microcontact printing to confine cell spreading within cell trapping chambers. The design of the block geometry inside the compression chamber was optimized by using computational simulations. Additionally. we have implemented step-wise pneumatically controlled cell trapping to allow more compression chambers to be incorporated while minimizing mechanical perturbation on trapped cells. Using breast epithelial MCF10A cells stably expressing a fluorescent actin marker. we successfully demonstrated the new device design by separately trapping single cells in different chambers. confining cell spreading on microcontact printed islands. and applying cyclic planar compression onto single cells. We found that there is no permanent deformation after a 0.5 Hz cyclic compressive load for 6 minutes was removed. Overall. the development of the single-cell compression microfluidic device opens up new opportunities in mechanobiology and cell mechanics studies.,True,-ojGbz4AAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,8,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00148/full,9693898967069521233,/scholar?cites=9693898967069521233,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00148/full,0,0,0

Electrochemical lactate sensors were fabricated. placed into 5 Fr central venous catheters (CVCs). and paired with wireless potentiostat devices. Following in vivo evaluation and calibration. sensors were placed within the jugular and femoral veins of a porcine subject as a preliminary assessment of in vivo measurement accuracy. The mobile electronic circuit potentiostat devices supplied the operational voltage for the sensors. measured the resultant steady-state current. and recorded the sensor response values in internal memory storages. An in vivo time trace of implanted intravenous (IV) sensors demonstrated lactate values that correlated well with the discrete measurements of blood samples on a benchtop point-of-care sensor-based instrument. Currents measured continuously from the implanted lactate sensors over 10 h were converted into lactate concentration values through use of a two-point in vivo calibration. Study shows that intravenously implanted sensors had more accurate readings. faster peak-reaching rates. and shorter peak-detection times compared to subcutaneously placed sensors. IV implanted and subcutaneously placed sensors closer to the upper body (in this case neck) showed faster response rates and more accurate measurements compared to those implanted in the lower portion of the porcine model.

Here we show that compressive stress enhanced invasion. matrix degradation. and invadopodia formation of breast cancer cells. We further identified Piezo1 channels as the putative mechanosensitive cellular components that transmit the compression to induce calcium influx. which in turn triggers activation of RhoA. Src. FAK. and ERK signaling. as well as MMP-9 expression. Interestingly. for the first time we observed invadopodia with matrix degradation ability on the apical side of the cells. similar to those commonly observed at the cell’s ventral side. Furthermore. we demonstrate that Piezo1 and caveolae were both involved in mediating the compressive stress-induced cancer cell invasive phenotype as Piezo1 and caveolae were often colocalized. and reduction of Cav-1 expression or disruption of caveolae with methyl-β-cyclodextrin led to not only reduced Piezo1 expression but also attenuation of the invasive phenotypes promoted by compressive stress. Taken together. our data indicate that mechanical compressive stress activates Piezo1 channels to mediate enhanced cancer cell invasion and matrix degradation that may be a critical mechanotransduction pathway during. and potentially a novel therapeutic target for. breast cancer metastasis,True,-ojGbz4AAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,3,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513218v1.abstract,10439921565859973435,/scholar?cites=10439921565859973435,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/01/07/513218.full.pdf,0,0,0

In particular. it focuses on the mutual dependency of theoretical conjectures about learning in the experimental sciences and technological opportunities in creating learning environments. The design process involves a detailed analysis of the expert task and knowledge. e.g.. spectrophotometry as a method for the determination of the concentration of a compound in a solution. In so doing. modifications in transposing tasks and knowledge to the learning situation can be monitored. The remote laboratory is described. as well as the specific features that alter the degree of fidelity of the learning situation in comparison with the expert one.

Most symbionts are gram-negative. and two types of bacteria have traits of Archaea and one type of bacteria is similar to Planctomycetes.

Identifying prognostic markers and potential targets is essential for improved MDS therapy.We explored how GFI136N influences onset and progression of MDS and investigated the biological mechanisms behind our findings.To examine the role of GFI136N with regard to progression of MDS to AML. we characterized the status of GFI1 in 201 German …,True,kJEuR9MAAAAJ:lSLTfruPkqcC,1,https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/124/21/3245/97623,6455556629080004762,/scholar?cites=6455556629080004762,,,0,0,0

1054905,Rôle du facteur de transcription Gfi1b au cours de l’hématopoïèse précoce,2016,Damien Grapton,,,,,,"Résumé (s)Le facteur de transcription Growth factor independent 1b (GFI1b) est impliqué à différents stades dans la régulation de l'hématopoïèse. Il est notamment fortement exprimé dans les cellules souches hématopoïétiques et au cours de la différenciation des cellules des lignées érythroïdes et mégacaryocytaires. Grâce à un modèle de délétion conditionnelle chez la souris par le système CreLox. nous avons montré que l'absence de GFI1b entraîne une prolifération de cellules mégacaryocytaires incapables de produire des plaquettes. Notre étude ne permet pas de confirmer formellement la prolifération des cellules souches dans la moelle osseuse précédemment observée par notre équipe dans un autre modèle murin. En revanche. les souris GFI1b"" knockout"" présentent une augmentation des cellules souches circulantes dans le sang périphérique. Une analyse moléculaire préliminaire montre que GFI1b pourrait influer sur la régulation par le cycle circadien de la mobilisation de ces cellules dans le sang. Finalement. notre étude des effets biologiques de la délétion de GFI1b dans le compartiment hématopoïétique des souris adultes nous a permis de définir de façon plus précise le rôle de GFI1b dans l'hématopoïèse et de confirmer son rôle majeur dans la régulation de la mégacaryopoïèse et la production de plaquettes matures.",True,kJEuR9MAAAAJ:RGFaLdJalmkC,0,https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/13679,,,,https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1866/13679/Grapton_Damien_2015_memoire.pdf?sequence=2,0,0,0

The pool of long-lived HSCs is maintained throughout life by the self-renewal ability of HSCs. New evidence suggests the process of alternative splicing is an important regulator of the maturation and activation of blood and immune effector cells. It is presently estimated that almost all multi-exon genes in human genome undergo alternative pre-mRNA splicing. and aberrant splicing has been linked to a variety of human pathologies. However. the role that pre-mRNA splicing may have for HSCs behaviour remains largely unexplored. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates alternative splicing by binding exonic splicing silencers elements (ESS) resulting in exon exclusion from the mature mRNA.

We term this phenomenon “cyclic mechanical reinforcement.” as the bond strength remembers the history of force application and accumulates over repeated cycles. but does not require force to be sustained.

They are essential to both cell motility and function by bidirectionally sensing and transmitting mechanical and biochemical stimulations. Several types of cell-matrix adhesions have been identified and they share many key molecular components. such as integrins and actin-integrin linkers. Mechanochemical coupling between ECM molecules and the actin cytoskeleton has been observed from the single cell to the single molecule level and from immune cells to neuronal cells. However. the mechanisms underlying force regulation of integrin-mediated mechanotransduction still need to be elucidated. In this review article. we focus on integrin-mediated adhesions and discuss force regulation of cell-matrix adhesions and key adaptor molecules. three different force-dependent behaviors. and …,True,buHJrm8AAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014482716303172,11877992746137949386,/scholar?cites=11877992746137949386,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101173/,0,0,0

This vital capability is programmed in the thymus through selection of αβT-cell receptors (αβTCRs) recognizing peptides bound to MHC molecules (pMHC). Here. we show that the pre-TCR (preTCR). a pTα-β heterodimer appearing before αβTCR expression. directs a previously unappreciated initial phase of repertoire selection. Contrasting with the ligand-independent model of preTCR function. we reveal through NMR and bioforce-probe analyses that the β-subunit binds pMHC using Vβ complementarity-determining regions as well as an exposed hydrophobic Vβ patch characteristic of the preTCR. Force-regulated single bonds akin to those of αβTCRs but with more promiscuous ligand specificity trigger calcium flux.

Numerous studies have shown the critical roles of N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 in gene expression; however. few studies have focused on the H2A C-terminal tail. Here we present thorough computational studies on a single nucleosome particle showing the linker DNA closing and opening. which is thought to be nucleosome breathing. With our simulation. the H2A C-terminal and H3 N-terminal tails were found to modulate the nucleosome conformation differently. The H2A C-terminal tail regulates nucleosome conformation by binding to linker DNA at different locations. whereas the H3 N-terminal tail regulates linker DNA by binding to it in different patterns. Further MD simulation on tail truncated structures corroborates this analysis.

T‐cell functional outcomes correlate with 2D kinetics of membrane‐embedded T‐cell receptors (TCRs) binding to surface‐tethered peptide‐major histocompatibility complex molecules (pMHCs). However. most studies have measured TCR–pMHC kinetics for recombinant TCRs in 3D by surface plasmon resonance. which differs drastically from 2D measurements. Here. we compared pMHC dissociation from native TCR on the T‐cell surface to recombinant TCR immobilized on glass surface or in solution. Force on TCR–pMHC bonds regulated their lifetimes differently for native than recombinant TCRs.

The concave structure formed by a group of LRRs is thought to facilitate binding to globular protein domains with increased affinities. However. little is known about the conformational dynamics of LRRs in such a structure. e.g.. whether and how force induces conformational changes in LRRs to regulate protein binding and signal transduction. Here we investigated the platelet glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα). a demonstrated mechanoreceptor with known crystal structures for the N-terminal domain (GPIbαN). as a model for LRR-containing proteins using a combined method of steered molecular dynamics simulations and single-molecule force spectroscopy with a biomembrane force probe.

Crystal structures of P- and E-selectin suggest a two-state model in which ligand binding to the lectin domain closes loop 83–89 around the Ca2+ coordination site. enabling Glu-88 to engage Ca2+ and fucose. This triggers further allostery that opens the lectin/EGF domain hinge. The model posits that force accelerates transition from the bent (low affinity) to the extended (high affinity) state. However. transition intermediates have not been described. and the role of Glu-88 in force-assisted allostery has not been examined.

Age. cardiovascular disease. and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for severe disease and death from viral infection. Immunometabolic therapies for these populations hold promise to reduce the risks of death and disability. Such interventions have pleiotropic effects that might not only target the virus itself but also enhance supportive care to reduce cardiopulmonary complications. improve cognitive resilience. and facilitate functional recovery. Ketone bodies are endogenous metabolites that maintain cellular energy but also feature drug-like signaling activities that affect immune activity. metabolism. and epigenetics.

However. the underlying cause of this phenotype has not been well characterized. Furthermore. the splenomegaly phenotype seen in lymphotoxin (LT) signaling-deficient mice is characterized by increased numbers of splenocytes and splenic neutrophils. Splenomegaly. as well as the related phenotype of increased lymphocyte counts in non-lymphoid tissues. is thought to result from the absence of secondary lymphoid tissues in LT-deficient mice. We now present evidence that mice deficient in LTα 1 β 2 or LTβR develop splenomegaly and increased numbers of lymphocytes in non-lymphoid tissues in a microbiota-dependent manner.

Notably. a role for lymphotoxin as a key effector cytokine has emerged to add to its foundational contribution to lymphoid organogenesis. It is now clear that lymphotoxin contributes to host defense for a wide variety of pathogens. and the lymphotoxin receptor is a defining feature of and regulatory mechanism in both innate and adaptive immunities. Specifically. lymphotoxin contributes to Th education. licensing of IL-22 production from type 3 innate lymphoid cells. and even maintains innate myeloid populations within the fully developed lymph node. Most recently. lymphotoxin has been implicated in regulation of the microbiota and metabolic disease.

Класифікаційна проблематика належить до категорії найбільш складних розділів ґрунтознавства. Наука про ґрунт дуже молода. Вона нараховує всього близько 130 років і постійно розвивається. На новому етапі її розвитку виникає необхідність вирішувати нові класифікаційні питання. Тому є закономірною поява класифікацій ґрунтів окремих учених і національних класифікацій різних держав світу. Це подібний процес розвитку будь-якої природничої науки. Бажання ґрунтознавців мати інтегровану класифікацію ґрунтів світу: є занадто складним завданням. Перші і вагомі кроки в цьому відношенні зроблено у класифікаціях ФАО-ЮНЕСКО і світовій реферативній базі (WRB)[8]. Але добре відомо. що інтегроване знання можливе тільки на диференційованій основі. Без диференціації знань немає інтеграції. а без інтеграційних процесів немає диференціації. Тому національні класифікації. що поступово з’являються.-явище закономірне. Нині багато країн світу мають «свою» класифікацію ґрунтів. Вирішення класифікаційної проблематики в Україні має свої особливості. По-перше. Україна була складовою царської Росії. на теренах якої зародилося ґрунтознавство. Першу генетичну класифікацію ґрунтів було розроблено засновником науки про грунт ВВ Докучаєвим. яку з часом доповнили ММ Сибірцев. КД Глінка. ПС Косович. Подруге. Україна була союзною республікою у складі Радянського Союзу. де класифікаційна проблематика ґрунтів досить інтенсивно і продуктивно розроблялася.

The so-called ‘‘hyperacute’’extradural haematoma displays ‘‘bubbles’’iso or hypodense within the hyperdense mass [1]. This combination of different densities has been attributed to three possible causes: 1) The coexistence of fresh blood. which has a low attenuation capacity. with clotted blood. 2) A decrease in hematocrit. 3) A mixture of blood with CSF due to dural tears.

We present the case of a patient who developed a brain abscess around a ventricular catheter left in place after removing the valvular system. CASE REPORT: This 38 years old woman. underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting for hydrocephalus secondary to an acoustic neurinoma. During a period of thirteen years she suffered two episodes of meningitis. and after the second one the CSF shunt was removed excepting for the ventricular catheter which appeared to be adherent to the choroid plexus. One year later. a brain abscess arised around that catheter. and both the abscess and the catheter were removed (Proteus mirabilis was the cultured germ). DISCUSSION: In spite of the risks related to removal of a proximal catheter adherent to the choroid plexus. the risk linked to the removal of a ventricular catheter must be counterbalanced with the risk of infection.,True,eNMwt5YAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,7,https://europepmc.org/article/med/15558205,4351227096678580349,/scholar?cites=4351227096678580349,,,0,0,0

In an attempt to better understand the Brca2-interacting properties. we examined four partners of the two isoforms of Brca2 identified in Arabidopsis (AtRad51. AtDmc1. and two AtDss1 isoforms). The two Brca2 and the two Dss1 isoforms are named AtBrca2(IV). AtBrca2(V). AtDss1(I). and AtDss1(V) after their chromosomal localization. We first show that both AtBrca2 proteins can interact with either AtRad51 or AtDmc1 in vitro. and that the N-terminal region of AtBrca2 is responsible for these interactions.

The chromo domain protein LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1) is a subunit of a plant PRC1-like complex in Arabidopsis thaliana and recognizes histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. a silencing epigenetic mark deposited by the PRC2 complex. We have identified and studied an LHP1-Interacting Factor2 (LIF2). LIF2 protein has RNA recognition motifs and belongs to the large hnRNP protein family. which is involved in RNA processing. LIF2 interacts in vivo. in the cell nucleus. with the LHP1 chromo shadow domain. Expression of LIF2 was detected predominantly in vascular and meristematic tissues. Loss-of-function of LIF2 modifies flowering time. floral developmental homeostasis and gynoecium growth determination. lif2 ovaries have indeterminate growth and produce ectopic inflorescences with severely affected flowers showing proliferation of ectopic stigmatic papillae and ovules in short-day conditions. To look at how LIF2 acts relative to LHP1. we conducted transcriptome analyses in lif2 and lhp1 and identified a common set of deregulated genes. which showed significant enrichment in stress-response genes. By comparing expression of LHP1 targets in lif2. lhp1 and lif2 lhp1 mutants we showed that LIF2 can either antagonize or act with LHP1. Interestingly. repression of the FLC floral transcriptional regulator in lif2 mutant is accompanied by an increase in H3K27 trimethylation at the locus. without any change in LHP1 binding. suggesting that LHP1 is targeted independently from LIF2 and that …,True,WLO8zCUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,49,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016592,15720425561533349224,/scholar?cites=15720425561533349224,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0016592,0,0,0

Because of their unique nuclear dimorphism. ciliates are powerful unicellular eukaryotic models to study the mechanisms involved in PGR. At each sexual cycle. the germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny. but the somatic nucleus. essential for gene expression. is destroyed and a new somatic nucleus differentiates from a copy of the germline nucleus. In Paramecium tetraurelia. the development of the somatic nucleus involves massive PGR. including the precise elimination of at least 45.000 germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences. IES). IES excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: a domesticated transposase. PiggyMac. is essential for DNA cleavage. and DSB repair at excision sites involves the Ligase IV. a specific component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. At the genome-wide level. a huge number of programmed DSBs must be repaired during this process to allow the assembly of functional somatic chromosomes. To understand how DNA cleavage and DSB repair are coordinated during PGR. we have focused on Ku. the earliest actor of NHEJ-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and three Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the genome of P. tetraurelia: Ku70a and Ku80c are produced during sexual processes and localize specifically in the developing new somatic nucleus.

Thanks to their unique nuclear dimorphism and to their original mechanism of programmed DNA elimination from their somatic nucleus (macronucleus). ciliates are emerging model organisms for the study of the impact of transposable elements on genomes. The germline genome of the ciliate Paramecium. located in its micronucleus. contains thousands of short intervening sequences. the IESs. which interrupt 47% of genes. Recent data provided support to the hypothesis that an evolutionary link exists between Paramecium IESs and Tc1/mariner transposons. During development of the macronucleus. IESs are excised precisely thanks to the coordinated action of PiggyMac. a domesticated piggyBac transposase. and of the NHEJ double-strand break repair pathway. A PiggyMac homolog is also required for developmentally programmed DNA elimination in another ciliate. Tetrahymena. Here. we present an overview of the life cycle of these unicellular eukaryotes and of the developmentally programmed genome rearrangements that take place at each sexual cycle. We discuss how ancient domestication of a piggyBac transposase might have allowed Tc1/mariner elements to spread throughout the germline genome of Paramecium. without strong counterselection against insertion within genes.,True,WLO8zCUAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,29,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/436196.pdf,13244628678502743099,/scholar?cites=13244628678502743099,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/436196.pdf,0,0,0

No organism can tolerate the absence of this activity. In this article. we show that dUTPase function is conserved between E. coli (Escherichia coli). yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and that it is essential in Arabidopsis as in both micro-organisms. Using a RNA interference strategy. plant lines were generated with a diminished dUTPase activity as compared to the wild-type. These plants are sensitive to 5-fluoro-uracil. As an indication of DNA damage. inactivation of dUTPase results in the induction of AtRAD51 and AtPARP2. which are involved in DNA repair. Nevertheless. RNAi/DUT1 constructs are compatible with a rad51 mutation. Using a TUNEL assay. DNA damage was observed in the RNAi/DUT1 plants. Finally. plants carrying a homologous recombination (HR) exclusive substrate transformed with the RNAi/DUT1 construct exhibit a seven times increase in homologous recombination events. Increased HR was only detected in the plants that were the most sensitive to 5-fluoro-uracils. thus establishing a link between uracil incorporation in the genomic DNA and HR. Our results show for the first time that genetic instability provoked by the presence of uracils in the DNA is poorly tolerated and that this base misincorporation globally stimulates HR in plants.,True,WLO8zCUAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,23,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018658,1813617790924849994,/scholar?cites=1813617790924849994,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018658,0,0,0

1055004,Greater than X kb: a quantitative assessment of preservation conditions on genomic DNA quality. and a proposed standard for genome-quality DNA,2016,Daniel G Mulcahy and Kenneth S Macdonald III and Seán G Brady and Christopher Meyer and Katharine B Barker and Jonathan Coddington,4,PeerJ,,e2528,PeerJ Inc.,Advances in biodiversity genomic sequencing will increasingly depend on the availability of DNA samples—and their quantifiable metadata—preserved in large institutional biorepositories that are discoverable to the scientific community. Improvements in sequencing technology constantly provide longer reads. such that longer fragment length. higher molecular weight. and overall “genome-quality” DNA (gDNA) will be desirable. Ideally. biorepositories should publish numerical scale measurements of DNA quality useful to the user community. However. the most widely used technique to evaluate DNA quality. the classic agarose gel. has yet to be quantified. Here we propose a simple and economical method using open source image analysis software to make gDNA gel images quantifiable. and propose percentage of gDNA “greater than X kb” as a standard of comparison. where X is a band from any widely used DNA ladder with desirably large band sizes. We employ two metadata standards (“DNA Threshold” and “Percent above Threshold”) introduced as part of the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) Darwin Core extension. We illustrate the method using the traditionally used HindIII ladder and the 9.416 base-pair (bp) band as a standard. We also present data. for two taxa. a vertebrate (fish) and an invertebrate (crab). on how gDNA quality varies with seven tissue preservation methods. time since death. preservation method (i.e. buffers vs. cold temperatures). and storage temperature of various buffers over time. Our results suggest that putting tissue into a buffer prior to freezing may be better than directly into ultra-cold conditions.,True,2hKMwcwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,16,https://peerj.com/articles/2528/,13252025381027287583,/scholar?cites=13252025381027287583,,https://peerj.com/articles/2528/,0,0,0

TLRs are a phylogenetically conserved diverse family of sensors that drive innate immune responses following interactions with PAMPs. TLR3 and TLR4 recognize viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) and bacterial endotoxin LPS. respectively. Importantly. these receptors differ in their downstream adaptor molecules. Thus far. only a few studies have investigated the effects of TLR3 and TLR4 in macrophages. However. a genome-wide search for the effects of these TLRs has not been performed in microglia using RNA-seq. Gene expression patterns were determined for the BV-2 microglial cell line when stimulated with viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) or bacterial endotoxin LPS to identify novel transcribed genes. as well as investigate how differences in downstream signaling could influence gene expression in innate immunity. Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation revealed that common and unique patterns of proinflammatory genes were significantly up-regulated in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. However. the IFN/viral response gene showed a stronger response to TLR3 stimulation than to TLR4 stimulation. Unexpectedly. TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation did not activate IFN-ß and IRF3 in BV-2 microglia. Most importantly. we observed that previously unidentified transcription factors (TFs) (i.e.. IRF1.

Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins are a group of epigenetic regulators that associate with acetylated histones and facilitate the transcription of target genes. A novel synthetic BET inhibitor. JQ1. was proven to exert immunosuppressive activities by inhibiting the expression of IL-6 and Tnf-α in macrophages. However. a genome-wide search for JQ1 molecular targets is largely unexplored in microglia. The present study was aimed at evaluating the anti-inflammatory function and underlying genes targeted by JQ1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells using two transcriptomic techniques: global transcriptomic biological duplicate RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR.

TLR agonists) are required to maintain essential macrophage function. The profound effects on biological outcomes of inflammation associated with IFN-γ pretreatment (“priming”) and TLR4 ligand bacterial LPS-induced macrophage activation (M1 or classical activation) have long been recognized. but the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Therefore. we analyzed gene expression profiles of macrophages and identified genes. transcription factors (TFs) and transcription co-factors (TcoFs) that are uniquely or highly expressed in IFN-γ-mediated TLR4 ligand LPS-inducible versus only TLR4 ligand LPS-inducible primary macrophages. This macrophage gene expression has not been observed in macrophage cell lines. We also showed that IL-4 and IL-13 (M2 or alternative activation) elicited the induction of a distinct subset of genes related to M2 macrophage polarization. Importantly. this macrophage gene expression was also associated with promoter conservation. In particular. our approach revealed novel roles for the TFs and TcoFs in response to inflammation.

In this review. we begin by describing the policy and management drivers for landscape-scale riverine research and we synthesize the technological advances that have enabled dramatic progress in the field. We then describe the development of landscape-scale riverine research through a series of landmark theoretical and review papers. Focusing on landscape-fish relationships. we consider the degree to which past efforts have been successful at meeting three challenges:(1) Has new research effectively incorporated the strengths of new technologies or are we doing the same old thing with more expensive data?(2) Have we incorporated key concepts from landscape ecology to improve our understanding of how landscapes affect rivers?(3) Have we been able to use landscape analyses to address management and policy needs? We conclude with a review of opportunities for advancement in the field of landscape-scale riverine research. These include moving toward the development of mechanistic theories of how landscapes affect rivers across disparate regions; considering the spatio-temporal structure of human impacts to landscapes; harnessing new statistical tools; and carefully defining landscape and response metrics to capture specific features.,True,uNL5HG8AAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,45,https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/46187,3661552680908380457,/scholar?cites=3661552680908380457,,https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/download/46187.pdf,0,0,0

1055027,Land Use,2018,Clemens Trautwein and Florian Pletterbauer,,,,241-252,Springer. Cham,Dendritic stream-river networks are the backbone of most landscapes on earth’s surface and determine linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These networks are hierarchically organized from microhabitats to the scale of whole catchments (Frissell et al. 1986). Accordingly. many processes of lotic freshwater ecosystems are determined by this hierarchically nested structure of river networks and their interlinkages. Hynes (1975) emphasized the importance of the linkage between the conditions within a river catchment and the fiows of energy. materials. and organisms in the river as a dynamic ecosystem. These fiows are interwoven in complex. cross-linked relationships of ecosystem functioning. Up to now. it is a prime challenge to understand these functions in detail and to robustly manage riverine landscapes in a sustainable manner. Starting with the work of Hynes (1975). the scale of riverine management was understood to occur over entire river catchments or even river basins with several concepts that integrated this perception (Vannote et al. 1980; Frissell et al. 1986; Ward 1989; Poff 1997; Fausch et al. 2002; Ward et al. 2002; Burcher et al. 2007). These theoretical frameworks seek to understand and to quantify interactions between landscape conditions over large spatial extents and instream responses. Ultimately. the catchment approach was even implemented into legal frameworks. such as the Water Framework Directive (WFD). which recognizes the river basin as relevant management scale (European Parliament 2000).,True,uNL5HG8AAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC,0,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27726/1002280.pdf?sequence=1#page=240,,,,https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/27726/1002280.pdf?sequence=1#page=240,0,0,0

Here. we report the genome sequence of a microbial eukaryote. the oxymonad Monocercomonoides sp.. which revealed that this organism lacks all hallmark mitochondrial proteins. Crucially. the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster assembly pathway. thought to be conserved in virtually all eukaryotic cells. has been replaced by a cytosolic sulfur mobilization system (SUF) acquired by lateral gene transfer from bacteria. In the context of eukaryotic phylogeny. our data suggest that Monocercomonoides is not primitively amitochondrial but has lost the mitochondrion secondarily. This is the first example of a eukaryote lacking any form of a mitochondrion. demonstrating that this organelle is not absolutely essential for the viability of a eukaryotic cell.,True,SAmb8kYAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC,242,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216302639,9356230620708028496,/scholar?cites=9356230620708028496,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216302639,0,0,0

Euglena gracilis in particular has noted metabolic flexibility. reflected by an ability to thrive in a range of harsh environments. E. gracilis has been a popular model organism and of considerable biotechnological interest. but the absence of a gene catalogue has hampered both basic research and translational efforts. We report a detailed transcriptome and partial genome for E. gracilis Z1. The nuclear genome is estimated to be around 500 Mb in size. and the transcriptome encodes over 36.000 proteins and the genome possesses less than 1% coding sequence. Annotation of coding sequences indicates a highly sophisticated endomembrane system. RNA processing mechanisms and nuclear genome contributions from several photosynthetic lineages. Multiple gene families. including likely signal transduction components. have been massively expanded. Alterations in protein abundance are controlled post-transcriptionally between light and dark conditions. surprisingly similar to trypanosomatids. Our data provide evidence that a range of photosynthetic eukaryotes contributed to the Euglena nuclear genome. evidence in support of the ‘shopping bag’ hypothesis for plastid acquisition. We also suggest that euglenids possess unique regulatory mechanisms for achieving extreme adaptability. through mechanisms of paralog expansion and gene acquisition.,True,SAmb8kYAAAAJ:vxA22ZmNLkoC,42,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-019-0626-8,3224489523831925093,/scholar?cites=3224489523831925093,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-019-0626-8,0,0,0

In Trypanosoma brucei. four DNA polymerases. namely PolIA. PolIB. PolIC. and PolID. related to bacterial DNA polymerase I (PolI). were shown to be localized in mitochondria experimentally. These mitochondrion-localized DNA polymerases are phylogenetically distinct from other family A DNA polymerases. such as bacterial PolI. DNA polymerase gamma (Polγ) in human and yeasts.“plant and protist organellar DNA polymerase (POP)” in diverse eukaryotes. However. the diversity of mitochondrion-localized DNA polymerases in Euglenozoa other than Trypanosomatida is poorly understood. In this study. we discovered putative mitochondrion-localized DNA polymerases in broad members of three major classes of Euglenozoa—Kinetoplastea. Diplonemea. and Euglenida—to explore the origin and evolution of trypanosomatid PolIA-D. We unveiled distinct inventories of mitochondrion-localized DNA polymerases in the three classes:(1) PolIA is ubiquitous across the three euglenozoan classes.(2) PolIB. C. and D are restricted in kinetoplastids.(3) new types of mitochondrion-localized DNA polymerases were identified in a prokinetoplastid and diplonemids. and (4) evolutionarily distinct types of POP were found in euglenids. We finally propose scenarios to explain the inventories of mitochondrion-localized DNA polymerases in Kinetoplastea. Diplonemea. and Euglenida.

1055035,Heterotrophic Euglenid Rhabdomonas Costata Resembles Its Phototrophic Relatives in Many Aspects of Molecular and Cell Biology,2020,Petr Soukal and Štěpánka Hrdá and Anna Karnkowska and Rafał Milanowski and Jana Szabová and Miluše Hradilová and Hynek Strnad and Čestmír Vlček and Ivan Čepička and Vladimir Hampl,,,,,,23 Euglenids represent a group of protists with diverse modes of feeding. To date. only a partial genomic 24 sequence of Euglena gracilis and transcriptomes of several phototrophic and secondarily osmotrophic 25 species are available. while primarily heterotrophic euglenids are seriously undersampled. In this work. 26 we begin to fill this gap by presenting genomic and transcriptomic drafts of a primary osmotroph. 27 Rhabdomonas costata. The current genomic assembly length of 100 Mbp is 14× smaller than that of 28 E. gracilis. Despite being too fragmented for comprehensive gene prediction. comparison of the 29 transcriptomic and genomic data revealed features of its introns. including several candidates for 30 nonconventional introns. 16% of transcripts bear a recognizable partial splice leader sequence. A set of 31 39.585 putative R. costata proteins were predicted from the transcriptome. Annotation of the 32 mitochondrial core metabolism provides the first data on the facultatively anaerobic mitochondrion of 33 R. costata. which in most respects resembles the mitochondrion of E. gracilis with certain level of 34 streamlining. R. costata synthesises heme by a mitochondrial-cytoplasmatic C4 pathway with enzymes 35 orthologous to those found in E. gracilis. The low percentage of green algae-affiliated genes. supports 36 the ancestrally osmotrophic status of this species. 37,True,SAmb8kYAAAAJ:qCaWouos7ogC,0,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-112847/latest.pdf,,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-112847/latest.pdf,0,0,0

Fototrofní krásnoočka. která tvoří dobře podpořenou skupinu. se vyznačují přítomností zeleného plastidu vzniklého sekun- dární endosymbiózou se zelenou řasou příbuznou dnešnímu rodu Pyramimonas. Obecně přijímaná teorie pozdního nabytí plastidu (plastid-late hypothesis) tvrdí. že k této en- dosymbióze došlo po oddělení fototrofních krásnooček od zbytku skupiny Euglenozoa. Endosymbiotická událost je vždy spojena s tokem genů z endosymbionta do jádra hos- titele. I když dojde k úplné ztrátě endosymbionta lze předpokládat. že genom hostitele byl obohacen o geny endosymbiotického původu. Některé současné fylogenetické ana- lýzy odhalily v genomu trypanosom (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatida) geny potenciálně plastidového původu.

A total of 129 pigs of three different genotypes were included in the experiment. After slaughter. the carcasses were weighed and backfat thickness was measured. On the next day. carcass dissection described by Walstra and Merkus (1995) was determined. Four prime cuts (shoulder. loin. ham and belly) were further dissected to meat. bones and fat with skin. Intramuscular fat content was analysed in a laboratory from the samples (100 g) of musculus longissimus dorsi. The results were statistically analysed using SAS/STAT and a linear model was used to find the dependence of intramuscular fat content. Correlation coefficients between carcass traits and intramuscular fat were also calculated. Sex of pigs. and particularly weight of lean meat and weight of fatty parts had a significant effect on intramuscular fat content (P< 0.0001 and P= 0.0022) while no effect of the genotype and slaughter weight was observed. Significant differences between castrates and gilts were found in almost all observed traits. eg average backfat thickness (29.01 vs. 25.56 mm). percentage of meat (52.77 vs. 57.68%). intramuscular fat content (2.49 vs. 2.00%). Generally. the intramuscular fat in the pig population is not sufficient (2.25%). therefore it would be desirable to include this trait in selection strategies in pig breeding.,True,RvOdYEQAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,38,https://81.0.228.28/publicFiles/00197.pdf,12272520460931574375,/scholar?cites=12272520460931574375,,https://81.0.228.28/publicFiles/00197.pdf,0,0,0

One hundred and forty-five hybrid pigs were weighed and scanned one to three days before slaughter by device ALOKA SSD 500. Each pig was scanned by both probes but at different levels of intensity. Cross-sectional images of longissimus dorsi muscle were processed by video image analysis for prediction of intramuscular fat content. Day after slaughter a sample of longissimus dorsi muscle was taken for laboratory analysis of true content of intramuscular fat. Correlation coefficients between predicted and true IMF content were calculated. Better results were achieved by probe 3.5 MHz than 5.0 MHz. Statistically significant correlation was found between analyzed IMF and estimated one at intensity of 80 % (r = 0.31). less significant at intensity of 75 % (r = 0.20).

During aging and in neurodegenerative disorders. these mechanisms are compromised. In fact. neurons show unique age-related changes in function and metabolism. resulting in greater susceptibility to insults and diseases. Aging affects the cells in the nervous system much as do cells in other organ systems. More precisely. as the nervous system ages. neuron metabolism may change. inducing glucose hypometabolism. impaired transport of critical substrates underlying metabolism. alterations in calcium signalling. mitochondrial dysfunction and so on. Moreover. in neuronal aging an accumulation of dysfunctional and aggregated proteins and mitochondria is observed. as a result of an oxidative imbalance: reduced antioxidant defenses and/or increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These changes lead to greater vulnerability of neurons in various regions of the brain and increasing susceptibility to various diseases.

The mechanotransduction regulates several aspects of the cell behavior. including migration. proliferation. and differentiation in a time-dependent manner. Several reports have indicated that cell behavior and fate are not transmitted by a single signal. but rather by an intricate network of many signals operating on different length and timescales that determine cell fate. Since cell biology and biomaterial technology are fundamentals in cell-based regenerative therapies. comprehending the interaction between cells and biomaterials may allow the design of new biomaterials for clinical therapeutic applications in tissue regeneration. In this work. we present the most relevant mechanism by which the biomechanical properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) influence cell reprogramming. with particular attention on the new technologies and materials engineering. in which are taken into account not only the biochemical and biophysical signals patterns but also the factor time.

In particular. the modulation of metabolic and energetic pathways in cancer cells has been discussed in some reports. but subsequently has been neglected for a long time. Meanwhile. over the past 20 years. a recovery of the study regarding cancer metabolism has led to an increasing consideration of metabolic alterations in tumors. Cancer cells must adapt their metabolism to meet their energetic and biosynthetic demands. which are associated with the rapid growth of the primary tumor and colonization of distinct metastatic sites. Cancer cells are largely dependent on aerobic glycolysis for their energy production. but are also associated with increased fatty acid synthesis and increased rates of glutamine consumption. In fact. emerging evidence has shown that therapeutic resistance to cancer treatment may arise from the deregulation of glucose metabolism. fatty acid synthesis. and glutamine consumption. Cancer cells exhibit a series of metabolic alterations induced by mutations that lead to a gain-of-function of oncogenes. and a loss-of-function of tumor suppressor genes. including increased glucose consumption. reduced mitochondrial respiration. an increase of reactive oxygen species. and cell death resistance; all of these are responsible for cancer progression.

However. no significant differences occur between LH and hCG treatments. measured as activation of downstream signals. such as Creb phosphorylation. Stard1 gene expression and testosterone synthesis. These data demonstrate that the responses to human LH/hCG are only quantitatively and not qualitatively different in murine cells. at least in terms of cAMP and Erk1/2 activation. and equal in activating downstream steroidogenic events.

To this purpose. phospho-extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2). protein kinase B (pAKT). cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB) activation and procaspase 3 cleavage were evaluated over three days by Western blotting. along with the expression of target genes by real-time PCR and cell viability by colorimetric assay.

Cell treatment by LH is accompanied by increased (serum-starved) cell viability. while hCG decreased the number of viable cells. The hCG-specific. pro-apoptotic effect was blocked by a physiological dose of 17β-estradiol. resulting in pAKT activation. lack of procaspase 3 cleavage and increased cell viability.

1055067,Impact of gene polymorphisms of gonadotropins and their receptors on human reproductive success,2015,Marino M Casarini L and Santi D,,,,,Reproduction,Gonadotropins and their receptors’ genes carry several single-nucleotide polymorphisms resulting in endocrine genotypes modulating reproductive parameters. diseases. and lifespan leading to important implications for reproductive success and potential relevance during human evolution. Here we illustrate common genotypes of the gonadotropins and gonadotropin receptors’ genes and their clinical implications in phenotypes relevant for reproduction such as ovarian cycle length. age of menopause. testosterone levels. polycystic ovary syndrome. and cancer. We then discuss their possible role in human reproduction and adaptation to the environment. Gonadotropins and their receptors’ variants are differently distributed among human populations. Some hints suggest that they may be the result of natural selection that occurred in ancient times. increasing the individual chance of successful mating. pregnancy. and effective post-natal parental cares. The gender-related differences in the regulation of the reproductive endocrine systems imply that many of these genotypes may lead to sex-dependent effects. increasing the chance of mating and reproductive success in one sex at the expenses of the other sex. Also. we suggest that sexual conflicts within the FSH and LH–choriogonadotropin receptor genes contributed to maintain genotypes linked to subfertility among humans. Because the distribution of polymorphic markers results in a defined geographical pattern due to human migrations rather than natural selection. these polymorphisms may have had only a weak impact on reproductive success.

Nonetheless. BRCA-testing in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients is not universally introduced in clinical practice. A retrospective analysis was conducted. firstly. to evaluate the rate of BRCA-positive families among those presenting a family history of PC besides breast and/or ovarian cancer. Secondly. the relationship between BRCA pathogenic variants and PC risk was evaluated. Finally. the characteristics of PC developed in BRCA families were described. Among 5143 family trees reporting breast and/or ovarian cancer cases. 392 showed a family history of PC. A total of 35 families (24.5% selected by the Modena Criteria and 21.3% by the NCCN Criteria) were positive to BRCA testing. Among the BRCA1 mutations. 36.8% were found within a region defined by c. 3239–c. 3917. whilst 43.7% of BRCA2 mutations were located within c. 7180–c. 8248.

We describe a novel large rearrangement of the BRCA1 gene identified in an Italian woman affected by an early onset bilateral breast cancer and a family history of hereditary breast cancer. The proband and her parents were negative for the presence of point mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to detect rearrangements in the BRCA1 gene. The breakpoint of the rearrangement identified in the proband was defined by restriction mapping and PCR amplification.

С начала официальной регистрации (1991г.) отмечен значительный рост уровня заболеваемости токсокарозом населения юга России. который колебался от 0.03 в 1991г. (Информационный бюллетень. 1992г.) до 2.32 на 100 тыс. населения в 2012 г. По данным статистического наблюдения. заболеваемость токсокарозом населения Российской Федерации в период с 2008 по 2012 гг. составляет в среднем 2.1 на 100 тыс. населения. колеблясь от0в Республике Дагестан до 31.4 на 100 тыс. населения в Республике Алтай. Такую вариабельность данных официальной статистики не всегда можно объяснить эколого-гельминтологическим состоянием внешней среды. При этом на ряде территорий с высоким уровнем заболеваемости. в частности. в Алтайском крае доля детей составляет 16.7%. в Краснодарском крае токсокароз в 6 раз чаще регистрируется у взрослых. В Республике Дагестан при высоких уровнях заболеваемости другими геогельминтозами (аскаридозом и трихоцефалезом) токсокароз не регистрируется. Учитывая различную частоту выявления случаев токсокароза на различных территориях юга России. нами было проведено сероэпидемиологическое обследование условно здоровых жителей на некоторых территориях с целью изучения частоты контакта населения с возбудителем токсокароза и особенностей распространения данного гельминтоза.,True,8mL-NSAAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,17,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/15918659,11909721160725912561,/scholar?cites=11909721160725912561,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/15918659,0,0,0

Such induced defenses are often mediated by early defense signaling (EDS) rapidly activated by the perception of herbivore associated elicitors (HAE) that includes transient accumulations of jasmonic acid (JA). Analyzing 60 HAE-induced leaf transcriptomes from closely-related Nicotiana species revealed a key gene co-expression network (M4 module) which is co-activated with the HAE-induced JA accumulations but is elicited independently of JA. as revealed in plants silenced in JA signaling. Functional annotations of the M4 module were consistent with roles in EDS and a newly identified hub gene of the M4 module (NaLRRK1) mediates a negative feedback loop with JA signaling. Phylogenomic analysis revealed preferential gene retention after genome-wide duplications shaped the evolution of HAE-induced EDS in Nicotiana.

1055090,Galactose utilization sheds new light on sugar metabolism in the sequenced strain Dekkera bruxellensis CBS 2499,2015,Md Moktaduzzaman and Silvia Galafassi and Claudia Capusoni and Ileana Vigentini and Zhihao Ling and Jure Piškur and Concetta Compagno,15,FEMS yeast research,2,,Oxford University Press, Dekkera bruxellensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are considered two phylogenetically distant relatives. but they share several industrial relevant traits such as the ability to produce ethanol under aerobic conditions (Crabtree effect). high tolerance towards ethanol and acids. and ability to grow without oxygen. Beside a huge adaptability. D. bruxellensis exhibits a broader spectrum in utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources in comparison to S. cerevisiae. With the aim to better characterize its carbon source metabolism and regulation. the usage of galactose and the role that glucose plays on sugar metabolism were investigated in D. bruxellensis CBS 2499.
