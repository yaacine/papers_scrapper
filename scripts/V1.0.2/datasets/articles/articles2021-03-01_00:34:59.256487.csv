RVFV encodes a nucleoprotein (N) that encapsidates the viral RNA. The N protein is the major component of the ribonucleoprotein complex and is also required for genomic RNA replication and transcription by the viral polymerase. Here we present the 1.6 Å crystal structure of the RVFV N protein in hexameric form. The ring-shaped hexamers form a functional RNA binding site. as assessed by mutagenesis experiments. Electron microscopy (EM) demonstrates that N in complex with RNA also forms rings in solution. and a single-particle EM reconstruction of a hexameric N-RNA complex is consistent with the crystallographic N hexamers. The ring-like organization of the hexamers in the crystal is stabilized by circular interactions of the N terminus of RVFV N. which forms an extended arm that binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the core domain of an adjacent subunit. The conformation of the N-terminal arm differs from that seen in a previous crystal structure of RVFV. in which it was bound to the hydrophobic pocket in its own core domain. The switch from an intra- to an inter-molecular interaction mode of the N-terminal arm may be a general principle that underlies multimerization and RNA encapsidation by N proteins from Bunyaviridae. Furthermore. slight structural adjustments of the N-terminal arm would allow RVFV N to form smaller or larger ring-shaped oligomers and potentially even a multimer with a super-helical subunit arrangement.

To understand the implications of HEL2i scanning for catalytic activity and signalling by RIG‐I. we examined its ATPase activity when stimulated by duplex RNAs of varying lengths and 5′ composition. We identified a minimal RNA duplex that binds one RIG‐I molecule. stimulates robust ATPase activity. and elicits a RIG‐I‐mediated interferon response in cells.

The viral protease is therefore considered as an ideal antiviral drug target. To facilitate the development of protease inhibitors. we report three high-resolution co-crystal structures of bZiPro with peptidomimetic inhibitors composed of a P1-P4 segment and different P1′ residues. Compounds 1 and 2 possess small P1′ groups that are split off by bZiPro. which could be detected by mass spectrometry. On the other hand. the more potent compound 3 contains a bulky P1′ benzylamide structure that is resistant to cleavage by bZiPro. demonstrating that presence of an uncleavable C-terminal cap contributes to a slightly improved inhibitory potency.

This technique is particularly useful in target-based drug discovery projects as it provides protein-ligand binding information in solution. Accumulated studies have shown that NMR will play more and more important roles in multiple steps of the drug discovery process. In a fragment-based drug discovery process. ligand-observed and protein-observed NMR spectroscopy can be applied to screen fragments with low binding affinities. The screened fragments can be further optimized into drug-like molecules. In combination with other biophysical techniques. NMR will guide structure-based drug discovery. In this review. we describe the possible roles of NMR spectroscopy in drug discovery. We also illustrate the challenges encountered in the drug discovery process. We include several examples demonstrating the roles of NMR in target-based drug discoveries such as hit identification. ranking ligand binding affinities. and mapping the ligand binding site.

The present review will be focused on recent structural and protein-protein interaction information involving two viroporins found in enveloped viruses that target the respiratory tract;(i) the envelope protein in coronaviruses and (ii) the small hydrophobic protein in paramyxoviruses. Deletion of these two viroporins leads to viral attenuation in vivo. whereas data from cell culture shows involvement in the regulation of stress and inflammation. The channel activity and structure of some representative members of these viroporins have been recently characterized in some detail. In addition. searches for protein-protein interactions using yeast-two hybrid techniques have shed light on possible functional roles for their exposed cytoplasmic domains. A deeper analysis of these interactions should not only provide a more complete overview of the multiple functions of these viroporins. but also suggest novel strategies that target protein-protein interactions as much needed antivirals. These should complement current efforts to block viroporin channel activity.

This involves the so-called outer and inner membrane association clasps (OMC and IMC. respectively). In the α chain. the OMC involves a GxxxG-like motif. whereas in the IMC a conserved juxtamembrane GFFKR motif experiences a backbone reversal that partially fills the void generated by TM separation towards the cytoplasmic half. However. the GFFKR motif of several α integrin cytoplasmic tails in non-bicelle environments has been shown to adopt an α-helical structure that is not membrane-embedded and which was shown to bind a variety of cytoplasmic proteins. Thus it is not known if a membrane-embedded backbone reversal is a conserved structural feature in α integrins. We have studied the system αLβ2 because of its importance in leukocytes. where integrin deactivation is particularly important. Herein we show that the backbone reversal feature is not only present in αIIb but also in αL-TM when reconstituted in bicelles.

1170757,Quantifying the relationship between co-expression. co-regulation and gene function,2004,Dominic J Allocco and Isaac S Kohane and Atul J Butte,5,BMC bioinformatics,1,1-10,BioMed Central,It is thought that genes with similar patterns of mRNA expression and genes with similar functions are likely to be regulated via the same mechanisms. It has been difficult to quantitatively test these hypotheses on a large scale because there has been no general way of determining whether genes share a common regulatory mechanism. Here we use data from a recent genome wide binding analysis in combination with mRNA expression data and existing functional annotations to quantify the likelihood that genes with varying degrees of similarity in mRNA expression profile or function will be bound by a common transcription factor. Genes with strongly correlated mRNA expression profiles are more likely to have their promoter regions bound by a common transcription factor. This effect is present only at relatively high levels of expression similarity. In order for two genes to have a greater than 50% chance of sharing a common transcription factor binder. the correlation between their expression profiles (across the 611 microarrays used in our study) must be greater than 0.84. Genes with similar functional annotations are also more likely to be bound by a common transcription factor. Combining mRNA expression data with functional annotation results in a better predictive model than using either data source alone. We demonstrate how mRNA expression data and functional annotations can be used together to estimate the probability that genes share a common regulatory mechanism. Existing microarray data and known functional annotations are sufficient to identify only a relatively small percentage of co-regulated genes.,True,NDyEvlQAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,366,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-18,5652866507955114355,/scholar?cites=5652866507955114355,,https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-18,0,0,0

Anion exchange resins can bind and accumulate the algal cells out of suspension to form a dewatered concentrate. Treatment of the resin-bound algae with sulfuric acid/methanol elutes the algae and regenerates the resin while converting algal lipids to biodiesel. Hydrophobic polymers can remove biodiesel from the sulfuric acid/methanol. allowing the transesterification reagent to be reused. We show that in situ transesterification of algal lipids can efficiently convert algal lipids to fatty acid methyl esters while allowing the resin and transesterification reagent to be recycled numerous times without loss of effectiveness.

1170798,Resins that reversibly bind algae for harvesting and concentration,2013,Jessica Jones and Christine Beran and James Beach and Martin Poenie,32,Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy,4,1143-1149,,Algae have great potential to address a number of important needs such as water remediation and as a feedstock for biofuel and biochemicals. At present. harvesting or removing algae is expensive. especially in terms of the cost of making biofuel. The expense of harvesting algae arises from the cost of pumping and processing large amounts of water. In an effort to explore less expensive methods for harvesting. a series of weak anion exchange resins incorporating various weak bases with different pKa values were developed to bind and release algae as a function of pH. The best of these resins bind about 10% of their weight in algae. show 100% reversibility and reusability. and the ability to concentrate algae from dilute suspension to 30 g L−1. Furthermore. they have the potential for desalting algae grown in high salt media.

However. detecting T cell activation in live tissues remains a challenge due to highly noisy data. We developed a Bayesian probabilistic model to identify T cell activation based on calcium flux. a increase in intracellular calcium concentration that occurs during T cell activation. Because a T cell has unknown number of flux events. the implementation of posterior inference requires trans-dimensional posterior simulation.

Thymocytes expressing T cell receptors (TCRs) with high affinity for self-antigens displayed by medullary antigen presenting cells (APCs) undergo either negative selection or diversion to the regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage. thus ensuring maturation of non-autoreactive T cells. Because many self-antigens are expressed by only a small percentage of medullary thymic epithelial cells. thymocytes must enter the medulla and efficiently scan APCs therein to encounter the full array of self-antigens that induce central tolerance. Chemokine receptors play a critical role in promoting medullary entry and rapid motility of post-positive selection thymocytes. We found that the chemokine receptor CCR8 is expressed by post-positive selection CD4+ single positive (SP) thymocytes in mice. while the corresponding chemokine ligands are expressed by medullary APCs. and thus hypothesized that CCR8 would promote thymocyte medullary entry and/or rapid motility to induce negative selection.

Despite their indispensable role in generating functional T cells. the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate TEC development from endodermal progenitors in the third pharyngeal pouch (3 rd PP) are not fully understood. We recently reported that the T-box transcription factor TBX1 negatively regulates TEC development. Although initially expressed throughout the 3 rd PP. Tbx1 becomes downregulated in thymus-fated progenitors and when ectopically expressed impairs TEC progenitor proliferation and differentiation.

The thymic medulla is a specialized microenvironment in which post-positive selection thymocytes are screened for reactivity against a wide range of self-antigens. Autoreactive cells are tolerized via clonal deletion or differentiation into the regulatory T cell lineage. Both thymic dendritic cells (DCs) and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) present auto-antigens to thymocytes to induce central tolerance. Thus. it is critical that post-positive selection thymocytes enter the medulla and interact efficiently with antigen-presenting cells therein to avoid export of autoreactive naïve T cells.

Recent studies have demonstrated that ligation of OX40 can augment T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity in pre-clinical models and more importantly. OX40 agonists are under clinical development for cancer immunotherapy. OX40 is of particular interest as a therapeutic target as it is not expressed on naïve T cells but rather. is transiently up-regulated following TCR stimulation. Although TCR engagement is necessary for inducing OX40 expression. the downstream signals that regulate OX40 itself remain unclear. In this study. we demonstrate that OX40 expression is regulated through a TCR and common gamma chain cytokine-dependent signaling cascade that requires JAK3-mediated activation of the downstream transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5. Furthermore. combined treatment with an agonist anti-OX40 mAb and IL-2 augmented tumor immunotherapy against multiple tumor types. Dual therapy was also able to restore the function of anergic tumor-reactive CD8 T cells in mice with long-term well-established (>5 wks) tumors. leading to increased survival of the tumor-bearing hosts. Together. these data reveal the ability of TCR/common gamma chain cytokine signaling to regulate OX40 expression and demonstrate a novel means of augmenting cancer immunotherapy by providing dual anti-OX40/common gamma chain cytokine-directed therapy.,True,s4KJ-usAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C,45,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034467,5268011864096327219,/scholar?cites=5268011864096327219,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034467,0,0,0

However. to realize the full potential of immunotherapy. a comprehensive understanding of immune networks and how mutations impact network structure and functional output across cancer types is instrumental. Herein we systematically interrogated somatic mutations that could express neoantigens and alter immune responses in cancer patients compared to wild-type controls. To do so. we developed a network-based immunogenomics model (NIPPER) with scoring systems to prioritize critical genes and mutations eliciting differential HLA binding affinity and alternate responses to immunotherapy. These mutations are enriched in essential protein domains and often alter tumor infiltration by immune cells. affecting T cell receptor repertoire and B cell clonal expansion. Furthermore. we devised an interactome network propagation framework integrated with drug associated gene signatures to identify potential immunomodulatory drug candidates.

This recognition system is in stark contrast to the adaptive immune system. which relies on highly variable. randomly generated antigen receptors. A key limitation of the innate immune system's reliance on fixed PRRs is its inflexibility in responding to rapidly evolving pathogens. Recent advances in our understanding of inflammasome activation suggest that the innate immune system also has sophisticated mechanisms for responding to pathogens for which there is no fixed PRR.

For example. the random distributions might be indexed by a categorical covariate indicating the treatment levels in a clinical trial and might represent random effects distributions under the respective treatment combinations. We propose a model that describes dependence across random distributions in an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-type fashion. We define a probability model in such a way that marginally each random measure follows a Dirichlet process (DP) and use the dependent Dirichlet process to define the desired dependence across the related random measures.

This is achieved by augmenting the original probability model on data and parameters to a probability model on data. parameters and actions in such a way that the marginal distribution on the actions is proportional to expected utility.

Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication. followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications. giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25.498 genes encoding proteins from 11.000 families. similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans-the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families. indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes.

Why? Broadly. there are three reasons for pathogen failure. Either (1) the plant is unable to support the niche requirements of a potential pathogen and is thus a nonhost; or (2) the plant possesses preformed structural barriers or toxic compounds that confine successful infections to specialized pathogen species; or (3) upon recognition of the attacking pathogen. defense mechanisms are elaborated and the invasion remains localized. All three types of interaction are said to be incompatible. but only the latter resistance mechanism depends on induced responses.

Auditory hair cells emerge from a Sox2-positive sensory patch in the inner ear epithelium. which is progressively restricted during development. This restriction depends on the action of signaling molecules. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling is important during sensory specification: attenuation of Fgfr1 disrupts cochlear hair cell formation; however. the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we report that in the absence of FGFR1 signaling. the expression of Sox2 within the sensory patch is not maintained. Despite the down-regulation of the prosensory domain markers. p27Kip1.

In craniates. the trunk sensory system has evolved from simple mechanosensory neurons inside the spinal cord (intramedullary). called Rohon-Beard (RB) cells. to multimodal sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) outside the spinal cord (extramedullary). The fish and amphibian trunk sensory systems switch from RB cells to DRG during development. while amniotes rely exclusively on the DRG system. The mechanisms underlying the ontogenic switching and its link to phylogenetic transition remain unknown. In Xenopus. Six1 overexpression promoted precocious apoptosis of RB cells and emergence of extramedullary sensory neurons. whereas Six1 knockdown delayed the reduction in RB cell number. Genetic ablation of Six1 and Six4 in mice led to the appearance of intramedullary sensory neuron-like cells as a result of medial migration of neural crest cells into the spinal cord and production of immature DRG neurons and fused DRG. Restoration of SIX1 expression in the neural crest-linage partially rescued the phenotype. indicating the cell autonomous requirements of SIX1 for normal extramedullary sensory neurogenesis. Mouse Six1 enhancer that mediates the expression in DRG neurons activated transcription in Xenopus RB cells earlier than endogenous six1 expression. suggesting earlier onset of mouse SIX1 expression than Xenopus during sensory development.

The neuronal network responsible for respiratory rhythm generation in neonatal rat resides in the ventral side of the medulla and is composed of two groups; the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) and the pre-Bötzinger complex group (preBötC). The pFRG partially overlaps in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). which was originally identified in adult cats and rats. Part of the pre-inspiratory (Pre-I) neurons in the RTN/pFRG serves as central chemoreceptor neurons and the CO2 sensitive Pre-I neurons express homeobox gene Phox2b. Phox2b encodes a transcription factor and is essential for the development of the sensory-motor visceral circuits. Mutations in human PHOX2B cause congenital hypoventilation syndrome. which is characterized by blunted ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Here we describe the generation of a novel transgenic (Tg) rat harboring fluorescently labeled Pre-I neurons in the RTN/pFRG. In addition. the Tg rat showed fluorescent signals in autonomic enteric neurons and carotid bodies. Because the Tg rat expresses inducible Cre recombinase in PHOX2B-positive cells during development. it is a potentially powerful tool for dissecting the entire picture of the respiratory neural network during development and for identifying the CO2/O2 sensor molecules in the adult central and peripheral nervous systems.,True,G6OqrlIAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,17,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132475,3171066373834158994,/scholar?cites=3171066373834158994,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132475,0,0,0

To determine the immune response. larvae were infected with S. carpocapsae and Xenorhabdus nematophila to evaluate the effector mechanisms of both humoral and cellular processes. The symbiont bacteria presented an inhibitory effect on the phenoloxidase cascade with a low level of melanization. Besides. X. nematophila activated the synthesis of putative antimicrobial peptides on the hemolymph of infected larvae.

The use of biological insecticides in the form of entomopathogenic organisms is undoubtedly a fundamental resource for the biological control of insect pests in the future. These infectious agents and endogenous parasites generally act by profoundly altering the host’s physiology to death. but their success is closely related to the neutralization of the target insect’s immune response. In general. entomopathogen parasites. entomopathogenic bacteria. and fungi can counteract immune processes through the effects of secretion/excretion products that interfere with and damage the cells and molecules typical of innate immunity. However. these effects are observed in the later stages of infection. whereas the risk of being recognized and neutralized occurs very early after penetration and involves the pathogen surface components and molecular architecture; therefore. their role becomes crucial. particularly in the earliest pathogenesis. In this review. we analyze the evasion/interference strategies that entomopathogens such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis. fungi. nematocomplexes. and wasps implement in the initial stages of infection. ie. the phases during which body or cell surfaces play a key role in the interaction with the host receptors responsible for the immunological discrimination between self and non-self.

In particular. live X. nematophila actively impairs phagocytosis in host’s hemocytes through the secretion of inhibitors of eicosanoids synthesis. In this article we have investigated the cell surface structural features of X. nematophila responsible for the elusion from phagocytosis. To this end we have studied the uptake of heat-killed (hk). fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled X. nematophila by phagocytes from both a host insect and a mammalian species. In vitro dead X. nematophila passively resists engulfment by insect hemocytes without impairing the phagocytosis machinery whereas. unexpectedly. in vivo a significant phagocytosis of dead X. nematophila was observed. X. nematophila in vivo phagocytosis was increased by the co-injection of the specific inhibitor of pro-phenoloxidase (PO) system phenylthiourea (PTU). even if these effects were not observed in in vitro tests. Furthermore. biochemical modifications of X. nematophila cell wall implement in vivo phagocytosis. suggesting that this bacterium avoid phagocytosis because the ligand of phagocytic receptors is somehow buried or disguised in the cell wall. Finally. dead X. nematophila escapes engulfment even by human phagocytes suggesting that X. nematophila could be a useful model to investigate escape from phagocytosis by mammalian macrophages.

NY,Even though insects lack an adaptive immune system. they can survive in environments with many potentially pathogenic invaders. Insects challenge infections by innate immunity defense mechanisms. Among them hemolymph humoral components cooperate to perform melanization (humoral encapsulation) and bacterial clearance. Investigating these two processes is fundamental to understand and check the insect physiological condition either normal or altered by infections or environmental changes. Many experimental protocols to investigate humoral defenses in insects are present in the literature. but discrepancies between them often exist. Such discrepancies are mostly due to the different biology of animal models and to the nature of experimental approach. Here we described less time-consuming and cheaper protocols used to test the activity of both constituent and inducible humoral components …,True,Kwg7-pYAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,1,https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-0259-1_8,9211746539758815226,/scholar?cites=9211746539758815226,,,0,0,0

We demonstrated that the injection of S. aureus into the hemolymph of B. mori larvae led to a marked reduction of their survival rate within 24–48 hours. GPAs were not toxic to the larvae and cured S. aureus infection. Dalbavancin was more effective than first generation GPAs. Due to its great advantages (ie. easy and safe handling. low rearing costs. low antibiotic amount needed for the tests. no restrictions imposed by ethical and regulatory issues). this silkworm infection model could be introduced in preclinical phases—prior to the use of mice—accelerating the discovery/development rate of novel GPAs.,True,Kwg7-pYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC,0,https://www.mdpi.com/734540,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/9/6/300/pdf,0,0,0

One of the main drawbacks of using VMs in fish feed is related to the presence of a variety of anti-nutritional factors. which could trigger an inflammation process in the distal intestine. This reduces the capacity of the enterocytes to absorb nutrients leading to reduced fish growth performances. We evaluated the mitigating effects of butyrate and taurine used as feed additives on the morphological abnormalities caused by a soybean meal (SBM)-based diet in the distal intestine of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax).

We show as well that angiogenesis in this invertebrate shares a surprising degree of similarity with neovascularization in vertebrates. both at the biochemical and cellular levels. because it involves similar growth factors/growth factor receptors. and relies on analogous cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions.

Leeches were injected with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. fluoresceinated yeasts. sulfate spheres and ciliates (Protozoa). Shortly after injection. migrating cells appeared in the area of injection. The response of the cells occurred in relation to the injected micro or macro antigens. Each injection first provoked a migration of cells towards the non-self material. Afterwards. different responses (degranulation. phagocytosis. encapsulation. melanization) occurred.

Besides apoptosis. an increasing body of evidence indicates that in several insect species programmed autophagy also plays a key role in these developmental processes. We have recently characterized the midgut replacement process in Heliothis virescens larva. during the prepupal phase. responsible for the formation of a new pupal midgut. We found that the elimination of the old larval midgut epithelium is obtained by a combination of apoptotic and autophagic events. In particular. autophagic PCD completely digests decaying tissues. and provides nutrients that are rapidly absorbed by the newly formed epithelium. which is apparently functional at this early stage.

However. their roles in this context and the molecular pathways underlying their activation and regulation were only hypothesized. The results of the present study better clarify the timing of the activation of these two processes: autophagic and apoptotic genes are transcribed at the beginning of metamorphosis. but apoptosis intervenes after autophagy. To investigate the mechanisms that promote the activation of autophagy and apoptosis. we designed a set of experiments based on injections of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). Our data demonstrate that autophagy is induced at the end of the last larval stage by the 20E commitment peak. while the onset of apoptosis occurs concomitantly with the 20E metamorphic peak.

Its identification was carried out by means of light and electron microscopy and nucleotide sequencing of 16S gene. The bacterium is capable of rapidly multiplying in the silkworm gut and of invading other body tissues. as demonstrated by deliberate infection of germfree larvae and by subsequent TEM observations. E. mundtii can endure alkaline pH of the silkworm gut and it has been proved to adapt in vitro to commonly applied doses of chloramphenicol. whose use can further contribute to reduce competition by other bacteria in Bombyx mori alimentary canal.The modality of transmission of the infection to the larvae was among the objectives of the present research.

Leeches respond to surgical lesions with the same sequence of events as that described for wound healing in vertebrates. where collagen is important for the development of tensions in healing wounds. functioning as an extracellular scaffold for accurate regeneration of the structures disrupted by surgical or traumatic actions.Results. In surgically lesioned leeches. newly synthesized collagen is arranged in hierarchical structures. Fibrils can be packed and shaped to form cords or tubular structures. thus acting as an extracellular scaffold that directs and organizes the outgrowth of new vessels and the migration of immune cells towards lesioned tissues.

VEGF. TNF-α. TGF-β1. BDNF. BMP-2 and IGF-1). its in vitro effects on cell proliferation and its mechanical behavior.Methods: CGFs were obtained from volunteer donors. Blood cell localization was evaluated after properly morphological staining and immunohistochemistry. The amount of growth factors release was measured at 5 hours. 1. 3. 6. 7 and 8 days. using ELISA assay. Cells were cultured with and without CGF and their proliferation was evaluated after 72 hours. performing the quantification of Ki-67. using flow cytometry (FACS). The mechanical response of CGF under compression was also attempted.Results: The results showed that platelets and leukocytes were found in a very thin space called “buffy coat”. localized between the white and red part of CGF. Each growth factor evaluated. had a specific kinetic release with a great variability among subjects. The in vitro cell proliferation was stimulated. CGF showed an “apparent plasticity” and its mechanical response was influenced by fibrin network structure.Conclusion: These findings support the CGF’s clinical use and will allow us to better understand and improve the clinical …,True,OhnGT5sAAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,30,https://www.smartnote.ro/images/downloads_content/39/Characterization%202015%20Borsani%20-%20CGF.pdf,12470367406048493311,/scholar?cites=12470367406048493311,,https://www.smartnote.ro/images/downloads_content/39/Characterization%202015%20Borsani%20-%20CGF.pdf,0,0,0

Greece and Italy. At present. emphasis is on the development of integrated pest management based on biological control rather than on chemical insecticides. however the success of both systems is often insufficient. In this regard. RPW appears to be one pest that is very difficult to control. Thus investigations into the natural defences of this curculionid are advisable. RPW hemocytes. the main immunocompetent cells in the insect. are described for the first time. We identified five hemocyte cell types from the hemolymph of R. ferrugineus: plasmatocytes (∼50%). granulocytes (∼35%). prohemocytes (∼8%). oenocytes (∼4%) and spherulocytes (∼3%).

The larvae bore into the palm trunk and feed on the palm tender tissues and sap. leading the host tree to death. The gut microbiota of insects plays a remarkable role in the host life and understanding the relationship dynamics between insects and their microbiota may improve the biological control of insect pests. The purpose of this study was to analyse the diversity of the gut microbiota of field-caught RPW larvae sampled in Sicily (Italy). The 16S rRNA gene-based Temporal Thermal Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (TTGE) of the gut microbiota of RPW field-trapped larvae revealed low bacterial diversity and stability of the community over seasons and among pools of larvae from different host trees. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region confirmed low complexity and assigned 98% of the 75.564 reads to only three phyla: Proteobacteria (64.7%) Bacteroidetes (23.6%) and Firmicutes (9.6%) and three main families [Enterobacteriaceae (61.5%). Porphyromonadaceae (22.1%) and Streptococcaceae (8.9%)]. More than half of the reads could be classified at the genus level and eight bacterial genera were detected in the larval RPW gut at an abundance ≥1%: Dysgonomonas (21.8%). Lactococcus (8.9%). Salmonella (6.8%). Enterobacter (3.8%). Budvicia (2.8%). Entomoplasma (1.4%). Bacteroides (1.3%) and Comamonas (1%).

It is comprised of the variation among genotypes. species and ecosystems (CBD. 1992). Changes in biological diversity can have an adverse effect on natural and agricultural ecosystems. Adverse environmental effects are undesirable changes to valued structural or functional characteristics of ecosystems or their components (US EPA. 1998). Adverse effects on crop production could include yield loss. yield instability. reduced crop quality. increased pest management activity. more chemical pesticide use and additional labour to compensate for the loss of ecological services (Andow and Hilbeck. 2004). Failure of biological control can lead to pest outbreaks and yield loss. and reduced pollination services can reduce yield.

Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 125 to 500 mg/ml were determined against tested strains. The observed biological activity of 5-HCC could be due to two novel peptides. identified by capillary RP-HPLC/nESI-MS/MS. which present the common chemical-physical characteristics of antimicrobial peptides. Such peptides were chemically synthesized and their antimicrobial activity was tested. The synthetic peptides showed broad-spectrum activity at 12.5 mg/ml against the majority of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. and they were also able to inhibit biofilm formation in a significant percentage at a concentration of 3.1 mg/ml against staphylococcal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.

Thus far their ability to differentiate into tenocytes has not been investigated although a cell source providing a large supply of tenocytes remains a priority target of regenerative medicine in order to respond to the poor self-repair capability of adult tendons. Starting from this premise. the present research has been designed firstly to verify whether the co-culture with adult primary tenocytes could be exploited in order to induce tenogenic differentiation in AEC. as previously demonstrated in mesenchymal stem cells. Since the co-culture systems inducing cell differentiation takes advantage of specific soluble paracrine factors released by tenocytes. the research has been then addressed to study whether the co-culture could be improved by making use of the different cell populations present within tendon explants or of the high regenerative properties of fetal derived cell/tissue.   Methodology/Principal Findings Freshly isolated AEC. obtained from ovine fetuses at mid-gestation. were co-incubated with explanted tendons or primary tenocytes obtained from fetal or adult calcaneal tendons. The morphological and functional analysis indicated that AEC possessed tenogenic differentiation potential. However. only AEC exposed to fetal-derived cell/tissues developed in vitro tendon-like three dimensional structures with an expression profile of matrix (COL1 and THSB4) and mesenchymal/tendon related genes (TNM.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Maturation‐promoting factor (MPF) was examined in maturing pig oocytes by electrofusing them with germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes. Oocytes containing high levels of MPF (MI or MII stages) induced the breakdown of the GV introduced by fusion and the formation of the metaphase plate in 1 hr. A similar effect was seen when two or three GV oocytes were fused with a MII oocyte and then incubated for 1 hr in the presence of cycloheximide (a specific protein synthesis inhibitor). indicating that high levels of preformed MPF are present at the metaphase stage. During the maturation in vitro of cumulus‐enclosed oocytes. a first sharp rise in MPF was seen between 26 and 29 hr of culture (MI stage); MPF declined after 2 hr (AI‐TI stages) and again reached high levels at 35 hr. where it remained for the rest of maturation.

To this aim. oocytes matured under different culture conditions that allowed to obtain gradable level of cytoplasmic maturation. were used to produce conditioned media (OCM).

The conidial suspension of the fungus was administered using a sprayer on the whole plant over apterous adult aphids. The results indicated that both aphid species were susceptible to L. longisporum and that aphid populations were significantly reduced. compared to the control. Nine days after treatment. the LC50 value of the fungus was obtained as 5.9× 105 and 3.2× 106 conidia/ml for S. maydis and M. dirhodum. respectively. The LT50 value of the fungus at a concentration of 108 conidia/ml was obtained as 2.9 and 4.4 days for S. maydis and M. dirhodum. respectively.

In this paper we provide evidence on the involvement of botryoidal tissue cells in angiogenesis induced in H. medicinalis by a variety of stimuli including surgical wounds or the administration of modulators of neovascularization. Interestingly. we show that either human activators of vascular cell growth. or anti-angiogenic peptides like angiostatin and endostatin. or the drug mitomycin. can induce a prompt biological response in H. medicinalis. We show as well that angiogenesis in this invertebrate shares a surprising degree of similarity with neovascularization in vertebrates. both at the biochemical and cellular levels. because it involves similar growth factors/growth factor receptors. and relies on analogous cell–cell or cell–matrix interactions.

This architecture lends itself quite naturally to an epitaxial layout where collagen microfibrils envelop a central core of a different nature. Here we demonstrate an axial domain in collagen fibrils from rabbit nerve sheath and tendon sheath by means of transmission electron microscopy after a histochemical reaction designed to evidence all polysaccharides and by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy.

Recent descriptive studies suggest that colony losses are often related to the interaction between pathogens and other stress factors. including parasites. Through an integrated analysis of the population and molecular changes associated with the collapse of honeybee colonies infested by the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. we show that this parasite can de-stabilise the within-host dynamics of Deformed wing virus (DWV). transforming a cryptic and vertically transmitted virus into a rapidly replicating killer. which attains lethal levels late in the season. The de-stabilisation of DWV infection is associated with an immunosuppression syndrome. characterized by a strong down-regulation of the transcription factor NF-κB. The centrality of NF-κB in host responses to a range of environmental challenges suggests that this transcription factor can act as a common currency underlying colony collapse that may be triggered by different causes.

Zika targets cerebral neural precursors. a cell population essential for cortical development. but the cause of this neurotropism remains obscure. Here we report that the neural RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) interacts with the Zika genome and enables viral replication. Zika infection disrupts the binding of MSI1 to its endogenous targets. thereby deregulating expression of factors implicated in neural stem cell function. We further show that MSI1 is highly expressed in neural progenitors of the human embryonic brain and is mutated in individuals with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Selective MSI1 expression in neural precursors could therefore explain the exceptional vulnerability of these cells to Zika infection.,True,RcMNiPwAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C,104,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6346/83.abstract,12056604136099207485,/scholar?cites=12056604136099207485,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5798584/,0,0,0

We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of spike D614G in the United Kingdom using more than 25.000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite the availability of a large dataset. well represented by both spike 614 variants. not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive selection.

Ebp1 can also affect translation and cooperates with the polypyrimidine tract‐binding protein (PTB) to stimulate the activity of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of foot‐and‐mouth disease virus (FMDV). We report here the crystal structure of murine Ebp1 (p48 isoform). providing the first glimpse of the architecture of this versatile regulator. The structure reveals a core domain that is homologous to methionine aminopeptidases. coupled to a C‐terminal extension that contains important motifs for binding proteins and RNA. It sheds new light on the conformational differences between the p42 and p48 isoforms of Ebp1. the disposition of the key protein‐interacting motif (354LKALL358) and the RNA‐binding activity of Ebp1.

In the previous studies. weak positive or negative correlations have been found between the silent-site guanine and cytosine (GC) content and expression of mammalian genes. However. previous studies disregarded differences in the genomic context of genes. which could potentially obscure any correlation between GC content and expression. In the present work. we directly compared the expression of GC-rich and GC-poor genes placed in the context of identical promoters and UTR sequences. We performed transient and stable transfections of mammalian cells with GC-rich and GC-poor versions of Hsp70. green fluorescent protein. and IL2 genes. The GC-rich genes were expressed several-fold to over a 100-fold more efficiently than their GC-poor counterparts. This effect was not due to different translation rates of GC-rich and GC-poor mRNA. On the contrary. the efficient expression of GC-rich genes resulted from their increased steady-state mRNA levels. mRNA degradation rates were not correlated with GC content. suggesting that efficient transcription or mRNA processing is responsible for the high expression of GC-rich genes.

All filoviruses encode a unique multi-functional protein termed VP35. The C-terminal double-stranded (ds)RNA-binding domain (RBD) of VP35 has been implicated in interferon antagonism and immune evasion. Crystal structures of the VP35 RBD from two ebolaviruses have previously demonstrated that the viral protein caps the ends of dsRNA. However. it is not yet understood how the expanses of dsRNA backbone. between the ends. are masked from immune surveillance during filovirus infection. Here. we report the crystal structure of MARV VP35 RBD bound to dsRNA. In the crystal structure. molecules of dsRNA stack end-to-end to form a pseudo-continuous oligonucleotide. This oligonucleotide is continuously and completely coated along its sugar-phosphate backbone by the MARV VP35 RBD. Analysis of dsRNA binding by dot-blot and isothermal titration calorimetry reveals that multiple copies of MARV VP35 RBD can indeed bind the dsRNA sugar-phosphate backbone in a cooperative manner in solution. Further. MARV VP35 RBD can also cap the ends of the dsRNA in solution. although this arrangement was not captured in crystals. Together. these studies suggest that MARV VP35 can both coat the backbone and cap the ends. and that for MARV. coating of the dsRNA backbone may be an essential mechanism by which dsRNA is masked from backbone-sensing immune surveillance molecules.,True,Auia0tQAAAAJ:HDshCWvjkbEC,71,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002916,13572008371217799457,/scholar?cites=13572008371217799457,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002916,0,0,0

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets.

We have previously shown that SARS-CoV has the ability to prevent the activation of IRF-3. thus inhibiting the synthesis of the antiviral type I interferons (IFN) such as IFN-beta. Several unspecific as well as IRF-3-specific IFN antagonists of SARS-CoV have recently been identified. However it was also suggested that cells may simply be unable to detect the infection. because the virus is hiding in compartments surrounded by a double layer of membranes. Here. we demonstrate that this balance of viral hiding and preventing the activation of the cellular defense mechanisms can be tipped by pretreating cells with small amounts of IFN-alpha.

Virol,10,4991,,La Crosse virus (LACV) is a mosquito-transmitted member of the Bunyaviridae family that causes severe encephalitis in children. For the LACV nonstructural protein NSs. previous overexpression studies with mammalian cells had suggested two different functions. namely induction of apoptosis and inhibition of RNA interference (RNAi). Here. we demonstrate that mosquito cells persistently infected with LACV do not undergo apoptosis and mount a specific RNAi response. Recombinant viruses that either express (rLACV) or lack (rLACVdelNSs) the NSs gene similarly persisted and were prone to the RNAi-mediated resistance to superinfection. Furthermore. in mosquito cells overexpressed LACV NSs was unable to inhibit RNAi against Semliki Forest virus. In mammalian cells. however. the rLACVdelNSs mutant virus strongly activated the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system. whereas rLACV as well as overexpressed NSs suppressed IFN induction. Consequently. rLACVdelNSs was attenuated in IFN-competent mouse embryo fibroblasts and animals but not in systems lacking the type I IFN receptor. In situ analyses of mouse brains demonstrated that wild-type and mutant LACV mainly infect neuronal cells and that NSs is able to suppress IFN induction in the central nervous system. Thus. our data suggest little relevance of the NSs-induced apoptosis or RNAi inhibition for growth or pathogenesis of LACV in the mammalian host and indicate that NSs has no function in the insect vector. Since deletion of the viral NSs gene can be fully complemented by inactivation of the host’s IFN system. we propose that the major biological function of NSs is …,True,GzqMcU0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.328.8134&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.328.8134&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

They either inhibit IFN synthesis. bind and inacﬁvate secreted IFN molecules. block IFN-activated signaling. or disturb the action of IFN-induced antiviral proteins. The molecular mechanisms involved range from broad shut-off of host cell metabolism to ﬁne-tuned elimination of key components of the IFN system. Type I (0./B) IFNs are produced in direct response to viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules that are sensed as a danger signal by infected cells. lFNs induce the expression of a number of antiviral proteins. some of which are again activated by dsRNA. Therefore. many viruses produce dsRNA-binding proteins to sequester the danger signal or express virulence genes that target speciﬁc components of the IFN system. eg members of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family or components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Evidently. viruses and their host’s innate immune response have co-evolved. leading to a subtle balance between virus growth and virus inhibition.

Aqueous synthetic human amylin spontaneously forms polymorphic fibrils in vitro. and this system was used to examine the dynamics of fibril assembly. By time-lapse atomic force microscopy (AFM). the growth of individual amylin fibrils on a mica surface was observed over several hours.

The amino-terminal 38 kDa portion remained embedded in the plasma membrane and was isolated and visualized as channel structures. The amino-terminal sequence of the cleaved 32 kDa portion matched an interior portion of the published amino acid sequence of the ovine Cx50 isoform. Thus. two closely spaced calpain cleavage sites were identified in the Cx50 molecule which were located carboxy-terminal from the predicted exit of the fourth transmembrane spanning segment by 62 or 72 amino acid residues. respectively.

1171605,Connexin family of gap junction proteins,1990,Eric C Beyer and David L Paul and Daniel A Goodenough,116,,3,187-194,Springer-Verlag,Gap junctions are composed of aggregations of membrane channels. called connexons. joined with similar connexons in adjacent cells to form intercellular pathways for the diffusion of ions and small molecules (Caspar et al.. 1977; Makowski et al.. 1977). The resulting intercellular communication is unique in that adjacent cells exchange cytoplasmic molecules directly. with no secretion into the extracellular space (Bennett. 1966; Loewenstein. 1966). Due to the large size of the intercellular channels formed by connexon pairs. the exchange of molecules between cells is nonspecific. and includes the entire pool of ions and small metabolites in each cell (Gilula. Reeves & Steinbach. 1972; Pitts & Simms. 1977; Simpson. Rose & Loewenstein. 1977; Goodenough. Dick & Lyons. 1980). This form of intercellular communication is ideally suited for the role of intercellular buffering of cytoplasmic ions (Corsaro & Migeon. 1977; Ledbetter & Lubin. 1979). synchronization of cellular behavior. such as the coordinated contraction of myocardial cells (Barr. Dewey & Berger. 1965) and the cell-to-cell coordination of metachronal waves (Moss & Tamm. 1987; Sanderson. Chow & Dirksen. 1988).

1171613,Gap junctions,1993,Eric C Beyer,,,,1-1,ACADEMIC PRESS INC LTD,Gap junctions are specialized plasma membrane regions that contain collections of transmembrane channels which provide a low resistance pathway directly linking adjacent cells. These channels provide for direct cell-to-cell transfer of ions and small molecules without exposure to the extracellular space (Bennett. 1966; Loewenstein. 1966). The exchange of molecules is nonspecific and includes the entire pool of metabolites and ions in each cell (Gilula et al.. 1972; Pitts and Simms. 1977; Simpson et al.. 1977; Goodenough et al.. 1980).Gap junction mediated intercellular communication has been implicated in many cellular functions. Gap junctions allow action potential propagation by passage of current carrying ions in electrically excitable tissues including myocardium (Barr et al.. 1965; Weidman. 1966; Sperelakis and Cole. 1989) and smooth muscle (Dewey and Barr. 1962; Sperelakis and Cole. 1989; Garfield et al.. 1977) and at electrotonic synapses in the nervous system (Bennett. 1977; Furshpan and Potter. 1959; McMahon et al.. 1989). In tissue culture experiments. gap junctions allow intercellular buffering of cytoplasmic ions (Corsaro and Migeon. 1977; Ledbetter and Lubin. 1979) and the sharing of low-molecular-weight substrates. which can bypass the deleterious effects of somatic cell mutations of various enzymes (Subak-Sharpe et al.. 1969; Cox et al.. 1970; Hobbie et al.. 1987). Metabolic cooperation of cells through gap junctions likely maintains homeostasis in avascular systems such as lens and ovarian follicles (Goodenough. 1979; Gilula et al.. 1978; Brower and Schultz. 1982).

France. Italy. and Greece. We classified the studied streams according to their long-term aquatic regime into the three following types:(i) permanent (P).(ii) intermittent with summer pools (IP). and (iii) intermittent with summer dry channels (ID). For each stream type. we analyzed taxonomic and trait diversity. as well as the composition of the macroinvertebrate community. following a spatially nested design at three spatial scales of analysis: microhabitat (substratum patches). mesohabitat (pools vs. riffles). and macrohabitat (streams). In order to assess intrinsic seasonal variability in streams from the Mediterranean region. 20 Surber samples were taken from each stream according to meso-and microhabitat frequency in the wet and the dry season during 2010. Given the need for adaptation to specific hydrological conditions and the fact that microhabitats should encompass the niche requirements of particular taxa. we hypothesized that this spatial scale would have a greater influence on macroinvertebrate taxa composition and biological traits than the other two larger spatial scales in intermittent streams. We observed that patterns in the relative importance of variance components across hierarchical spatial scales changed with time because low flow or droughts altered both mesohabitat prevalence and microhabitat composition.

Evrotas. an intermittent river located in Southern Greece. was used as a case study to assess the impacts of water stress on Mediterranean lotic ecosystems. Based on hydrological analyses. it was revealed that during prolonged drought years. such as the summers of 2007 and 2008. the vast majority of the Evrotas riverbed was completely desiccated. primarily as a result of substantial water abstraction for irrigation. The effects of desiccation on the riverine ecosystem were evaluated using fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages according to the demands of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC (WFD).

A habitat modelling approach was adopted to simulate and assess the ecological effects of physical aquatic habitat changes in Greek upland rivers downstream of water abstraction schemes (dams. river diversions. etc). since there is an intense debate about the construction of small hydroelectric plants in montane rivers. Two sites on the Acheloos river were chosen as study areas (Tripotamo and Mesochora upstream of the Mesochora dam). because they are located in relatively undisturbed conditions. Standard hydraulic simulation and aquatic habitat modelling was based on data surveyed along cross-sectional transects in a representative river reach. After field data collection a hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) was applied for different flows. The representative reach comprised of the habitat types and approximated proportions detected in a previous exploratory charting of hydromorphological units over a longer piece of river. Thus. a river segment for hydraulic modelling was identified in each of the study sites (segments with relatively homogeneous conditions in terms of hydrology. geomorphology. and habitats).

For designing optimal conservation and management strategies for the particular ecosystems. appropriate characterization and classification of these ponds is necessary based on the different type of habitats and on their varying environmental conditions. This paper presents the current ecological status and the threats of Mediterranean temporary ponds and summarizes some management and conservation issues based on the existing experience on a regional level. Emphasis is given in the Greek MTPs with respect to their characteristics and the pressures received mainly from human activities such as agriculture and water overexploitation.

Flow degradation is especially prominent in Mediterranean systems and assessing environmental flows in modified rivers is difficult. especially in environments with poor hydrologic monitoring and data availability. In many Mediterranean countries. which are characterized by pronounced natural variability and low summer flows. water management actions usually focus on prescribing minimum acceptable flows estimated by hydrologic methods. In this study. a comparative assessment of environmental flow estimation methods is developed in a river with poorly monitored flows and limited understanding of past reference conditions. This assessment incorporates both a hydrologic and a fish habitat simulation effort that takes into consideration hydrologic seasonality in a Greek mountainous river.

A habitat modelling approach was adopted to simulate and assess the ecological effects of physical aquatic habitat changes in Greek upland rivers downstream of water abstraction schemes (dams. river diversions. etc). since there is an intense debate about the construction of small hydroelectric plants in montane rivers. Two sites on the Acheloos river were chosen as study areas (Tripotamo and Mesochora upstream of the Mesochora dam). because they are located in relatively undisturbed conditions. Standard hydraulic simulation and aquatic habitat modelling was based on data surveyed along cross-sectional transects in a representative river reach. After field data collection a hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) was applied for different flows. The representative reach comprised of the habitat types and approximated proportions detected in a previous exploratory charting of hydromorphological units over a longer piece of river. Thus. a river segment for hydraulic modelling was identified in each of the study sites (segments with relatively homogeneous conditions in terms of hydrology. geomorphology. and habitats). The basic scheme of the physical habitat simulation was applied. based on a 1-dimentional hydraulic modelling. habitat evaluation with Habitat Suitability Curves (hereafter HSC) and generation of Weighted Usable Curves in function of river flow.

In contrast to the more or less local adverse effects of impoundments or stream channelization. artificial flow fluctuations generally disturb a long section of a given river. Within all the river sections investigated. a breakdown of the benthic invertebrate biomass of between 75 and 95% was observed within the first few kilometres of river length. A reduction of between 40 and 60% of biomass compared with undisturbed areas could be detected within the following 20–40 km. The reduction of the fish fauna is within the same order of magnitude and correlates well with the amplitude of the flow fluctuations.

The samples were taken according to the AQEM site protocol procedure. keeping transport and depositional habitats samples separated. In each stream type. at least 13 sites were studied over a gradient of organic pollution (pre-classification). The benthic macroinvertebrates were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. A Detrended Correspondence Analysis of macroinvertebrate communities identified a gradient of organic pollution strongly related to the first axis.

Austria,1993,Mathias Jungwirth and Otto Moog and Susanne Muhar,8,Regulated Rivers: Research & Management,1‐2,195-204,John Wiley & Sons. Ltd,Studies conducted on 15 sections of seven different epipotamal streams between 1981 and 1984 established the impact of river bed structures on fish communities. Reduced spatial heterogeneity due to river straightening resulted in decreasing numbers of fish species. stock density and biomass. The variance of maximum depths (VMD) used as a measure of habitat structure showed a highly significant correlation with the number (NFS) and diversity of fish species (DFS). In 1987 these models were used for the evaluation of a planned restructuring project on a channelized section of the Melk River. which was realized in 1988. During a three year investigation of the response of the fish fauna and benthic community to changed hydraulic and morphometric conditions within the restructured river bed section the validity of the VMD/NFS model could be verified.

The draft of the WFD defines a framework for assessing water bodies in the future (COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. 1999). The ecological status of rivers must be determined on the basis of nearnatural reference conditions. Thus the assessment of possible changes in water quality from a water type-specific. natural reference condition is at the core of this directive. As a result the elaboration of a comprehensive typology of surface waters in which. according to the WFD. ecoregions have some influence on the level of spatial differentiation constitutes a fundamental basis for the evaluation process.The member states of the European Union (EU) agreed to accept the zoogeographic regions of Europe. compiled by ILLIES (1978) as a geographic typology comparable to the ecoregional approach. The 25 Illies regions of Europe cover an area that seems too big to provide a framework for organising ecological data for a regional management approach.

Internal costs are made up of the sum of investment costs. operating costs. financial costs and taxes. While some of these factors identified can be calculated directly in terms of money. biophysical and social aspects demand the definition of units of measurement. In order to homogenize results. an annual reference is proposed. A monetary value can be …,True,-S2uddwAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,76,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001191640600004X,4260943278412120790,/scholar?cites=4260943278412120790,,https://www.academia.edu/download/7342914/Feasability_economy_BIS.pdf,0,0,0

1171746,Riparian vegetation of streams and the macroinvertebrate community structure,2001,B Bis and LWG Higler,1,International Journal of Ecohydrology and Hydrobiology,01,,,Riparian vegetation is a typical ecotone by its structural and functional position between the terrestial part of the watershed and the stream (Naiman. Decamps 1990). In consequence. the riparian zone forming an integrated component of stream ecosystems significantly determines the aquatic community. Macroinvertebrates are affected by defined variability of environmental factors. In streams under canopy: light access is reduced; summer temperatures are lower; shed leaves form the main source of energy; insects falling from the vegetation into the water create another source of food; roots from trees form shelter and strongly influence hydraulic patterns. As a result. many (micro) habitats can exist and persist. The relationships between the covered percentage of the riparian zone. hydraulic processes. POM retention and macroinvertebrate functional organization was analyzed. Riparian vegetation forms a buffer zone in agricultural landscape and thus prevents inflow of nutrients. but also of fine sediments. Clearing of riparian vegetation changes all these conditions. resulting in a totally different and less varied biocommunity.

The concept of a “reference condition” is increasingly used to describe the standard or benchmark against which current condition is compared. Many individual nations. and the European Union as a whole. have codified the concept of reference condition in legislation aimed at protecting and improving the ecological condition of streams. However. the phrase “reference condition” has many meanings in a variety of contexts. One of the primary purposes of this paper is to bring some consistency to the use of the term. We argue the need for a “reference condition” term that is reserved for referring to the “naturalness” of the biota (structure and function) and that naturalness implies the absence of significant human disturbance or alteration.

Additive partitioning of three measures of diversity (species richness. Shannon's diversity index H and Simpson's diversity D) was used to study the relationship between local and regional diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate communities of boreal lakes (littoral habitats) and streams (riffle habitats) across three spatial scales (sampling sites. ecoregions and biogeographic regions).2. Alpha (α) and beta (β) diversity are defined as within‐habitat and between‐habitat diversity. respectively. According to the concept of additive partitioning. diversity can be partitioned across multiple spatial scales such that the total (γ) diversity on one spatial scale becomes within‐habitat (α) diversity at the next higher scale. Hence. the total diversity at one scale is determined by the α diversity and the between‐habitat diversity (β) at the next lower scale.

Detection of impact often is constrained by variability of the data. the number of independent samples. the magnitude of impact to be detected. and statistical assumptions. Analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of macroinvertebrate indicator metrics of 16 Swedish lakes. situated in the boreo‐nemoral ecoregion. revealed that standardized effect sizes (i.e.. effect sizes expressed in standard deviation units) and estimates of statistical power varied markedly among habitats and with choice of indicator metric.

Dordrecht,Here we summarize results of the EU funded research project STAR concerning the suitability of different organism groups (fish. benthic invertebrates. macrophytes. diatoms) for monitoring European rivers. In a general way. the suitability of the organism groups is classified by monitoring type. stress type. river type. temporal scale and taxonomic resolution. For example. although all organism groups are affected by acidification. the relatively low species richness of fish and macrophytes in small mountain streams makes these two groups less suitable. and. hence. we argue that benthic diatoms and/or invertebrates may be considered as more robust indicators.

Natural ecosystems generally conserve nutrients and store organic matter effectively. In all agricultural systems. such conservation mechanisms are weakened. and management increases nutrient inputs over natural levels. These altered features of ecosystems together result in massive leakage of nutrients into waterways. Humans also concentrate nutrients from food and release excreta that generate immense nutrient flows in areas of high population density. even where modern sewage treatment technology is applied.

We used a rare model system. comprising a network of geothermally heated streams ranging in temperature from 5 °C to 25 °C. to explore the nature of the relationship between respiration and temperature. Using this ‘natural experiment’. we tested whether the natal thermal regime of stream communities influenced the temperature dependence of respiration in the absence of other potentially confounding variables. An empirical survey of 13 streams across the thermal gradient revealed that the temperature dependence of whole‐stream respiration was equivalent to the average activation energy of the respiratory complex (0.6–0.7 eV).

Recently. it is becoming increasingly common to use multiple organism groups in bioassessment. Advocates of the multiple organism approach argue that the use of different organism groups should strengthen inference-based models and ultimately result in lower assessment error. while opponents argue that organism groups often respond similarly to stress implying a high degree of redundancy.

This allowed the annual cycle of water temperatures and ice cover in these lakes to be described quantitatively. and their dependence on lake altitude above sea level to be investigated. LSWTs in the Tatra Mountains are found to decrease approximately linearly with increasing altitude from late spring to autumn. LSWT in summer can be modelled well in terms of exponentially smoothed ambient air temperature.

Gregory et al. 1991). Streams in forested ecosystems are usually heavily shaded and fauna is dependent on a food base derived from allochthonous inputs (Herlihy et al. 2005). Without adequate controls. silvicultural activities have the potential to cause significant changes of stream ecosystem by altering basins and riparian zone conditions (Naiman 1992). Their impacts on streams are dominated by heightened delivery of fine sediments (Waters 1995) and by flashy hydrological regimes (Eisenbies et al. 2007). Logging can alter the nature and timing of inputs of plant production into the stream and change the amount and type of particulate organic matter (Webster et al 1983. Gurtz & Wallace 1984. Davies et al. 2005). Forest cutting was shown having a great influence also on pH. water temperatures and conductivity of watershed ecosystem (Likens et al. 1970). Increasing solar radiation reaching the stream bottom and decreasing terrestrial canopy inputs potentially shifts food sources from allochthonous to autochthonous (Stockner & Shortreed 1976. Kedzierski & Smock 2001). Higher insolation is often coupled with increase in stream water temperatures (Swift 1983. Golladay et al. 1987. Holopainen et al. 1991). Removal of vegetation through harvesting can also increase leaching of nutrients from the soil system into surface waters and groundwaters (Swank 1988.

Using RHS attributes. Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) — a measure of natural habitat diversity. and Habitat Modification Score (HMS) — a measure of anthropogenic modifi- cation. we identified considerable differences in frequency. diversity and evenness of features between the regions. A relatively small subset of features clearly distinguish the hydromorphological characters of lowland. Alpine and southern European rivers.

The occurrence and abundance of 86 aquatic plant species was recorded at 48 sites on 19 rivers in the lowland part of Poland. Forty-six of these species are MTR scoring taxa used in the British system. but another 40 species were recorded of which 11 species were selected as potential scoring plants for use in Poland. The revision of MTR scoring plants used in Britain was performed and resulted in the proposed elimination of 24 taxa as scoring species for Poland. The habitat conditions of the selected river sites were assessed and their diversity was observed in terms of eutrophication level. The MTR score was evaluated and its correlation with water trophic level was shown. The environmental preferences of the individual plant species according to water chemistry were estimated to give proposals of the MTR scoring species in Poland and the indicated preference was analogous to the original Species Trophic Rank (STR) score used in the UK.

The results obtained could be used as a useful tool in defining guidelines for olive oil producers. so as to reduce the amount of organic pollutants in the water ecosystems. Measurements of nutrients. total organic carbon (TOC). dissolved trace metals and total phenols were performed in the riverine waters and the seawater close to the mouth of the rivers together with measurements of major and minor elements. organic carbon. phenolic compounds and organic pollutants in sediment samples.Rather elevated amounts of phenols (1.8–7.9 mg/L) and high concentrations of ammonium and inorganic phosphorus (7.29–18.9 mmol/L of ammonium and 0.5–7.48 mmol/L of inorganic phosphorus) were measured in small streams located close to the various olive oil refineries of the area. which are directly influenced by the liquid waste disposals. This is an indication that the produced wastes contain high quantity of phenols. potentially dangerous for the environment and are also rich in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus.

Also the N: P ratio was calculated. The station in Ligdou estuaries. despite the fact that it belongs to another river basin (Ligdou R.). was included in the sampling sites. since it flows into Pamisos R.. for a more objective assessment of the chemical status of the study area. A detailed picture of the nutrient input from Pamisos River into the Messinian Gulf arises from the results obtained. The concentration of phosphates showed significant spatial variation and the highest value was recorded at the station of Ligdou during the wet period. In general. this station seems to curry the highest load of many of the parameters measured and it charges the estuaries of river Pamisos and the Messinian Gulf with considerable amounts of nutrients. Nitrates were rather higher during the dry period at almost all stations while ammonia. on the other hand. was recorded higher during the wet period.

The availability of complete mitogenomes from Platyhelminthes is limited; of the 40 or so published most are from parasitic flatworms (Neodermata). Here. we present the mitogenomes of two free-living flatworms (Tricladida): the complete genome of the freshwater species Crenobia alpina (Planariidae) and a nearly complete genome of the land planarian Obama sp. (Geoplanidae). Moreover. we have reanotated the published mitogenome of the species Dugesia japonica (Dugesiidae). This contribution almost doubles the total number of mtDNAs published for Tricladida. a species-rich group including model organisms and economically important invasive species. We took the opportunity to conduct comparative mitogenomic analyses between available free-living and selected parasitic flatworms in order to gain insights into the putative effect of life cycle on nucleotide composition through mutation and natural selection. Unexpectedly. we did not find any molecular hallmark of a selective relaxation in mitogenomes of parasitic flatworms; on the contrary. three out of the four studied free-living triclad mitogenomes exhibit higher A+T content and selective relaxation levels.

Platyhelminthes) with facultative sex,2019,Laia Leria and Miquel Vila-Farré and Eduard Solà and Marta Riutort,19,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-19,BioMed Central,Predicted genetic consequences of asexuality include high intraindividual genetic diversity (i.e.. the Meselson effect) and accumulation of deleterious mutations (i.e.. Muller’s Ratchet). among others. These consequences have been largely studied in parthenogenetic organisms. but studies on fissiparous species are scarce. Differing from parthenogens. fissiparous organisms inherit part of the soma of the progenitor. including somatic mutations. Thus. in the long term. fissiparous reproduction may also result in genetic mosaicism. besides the presence of the Meselson effect and Muller’s Ratchet. Dugesiidae planarians show outstanding regeneration capabilities. allowing them to naturally reproduce by fission. either strictly or combined with sex (facultative). Therefore. they are an ideal model to analyze the genetic footprint of fissiparous reproduction. both when it is alternated with sex and when it is the only mode of reproduction. In the present study. we generate and analyze intraindividual cloned data of a nuclear and a mitochondrial gene of sexual. fissiparous and facultative wild populations of the species Dugesia subtentaculata. We find that most individuals. independently of their reproductive strategy. are mosaics. However. the intraindividual haplotype and nucleotide diversity of fissiparous and facultative individuals is significantly higher than in sexual individuals. with no signs of Muller’s Ratchet. Finally. we also find that this high intraindividual genetic diversity of fissiparous and facultative individuals is composed by different combinations of ancestral and derived haplotypes of the species.

However. most fishes have complex life-cycles. in that they pass through different levels of the food web and occupy different ecological niches during their lives (eg Nikolsky. 1963; Fukuhara. 1986; Luecke. 1986; Law. 1991; Osenberg et al.. 1992; Mol. 1995; Morgan et al.. 1995). This ontogenetic niche separation generates a great ecological distinction between life-stages. which prevents population size at one stage from being regulated in accordance with the carrying capacity of the next ontogenetic habitat. Rothschild et al.(1989) raised the implications of these issues on population control. and proposed that each life-history stage of fishes comprises a set of stabilising mechanisms that is generally independent of any other life-stage. Recognition of this independence has stimulated ecological classifications based on the characteristics of early development and ontogenetic habitat types of fishes. which use different criteria than the ecological classifications of adults (eg Balon. 1975. 1981). Balon (1984a. 1986a) distinguished five major ‘periods’ in the ontogenetic development of fishes (embryo. larva. juvenile. adult and senescence periods). and emphasised that during the embryonic and larval periods. fishes may live in separate habitats and encounter different environmental regimes than the adults.In this general context. it is necessary to explore the ecological aspects of the survival of the early life-history stages of estuarine fishes. from fertilisation through their embryonic and larval periods and extending into the juvenile (Chambers & Trippel. 1997 …,True,i2cdkBEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC,98,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5baJMjXEfL8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA54&dq=info:0TaC8uh3wRoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=8JQhoVhFWy&sig=dO4aMW6qNVp-WiPUSlix7N5eNts,1927953957876020945,/scholar?cites=1927953957876020945,,,0,0,0

Samothraki remains one of the last minimally disturbed islands in the Mediterranean. This paper examines the hydrogeochemical regime of the island’s surface waters as it results from geological. morphological. and hydro (geo) logical controls within a frame of minimally disturbed environmental conditions. Shallow. cracked groundwater aquifers. in combination with steep slopes and predominant weathering resistant rocks. bring about flashy stream regimes with remarkably low solute concentrations. Streams and springs revealed hydrochemical similarities. Contrary to streams chiefly draining sedimentary rocks. streams underlined by granite and ophiolite rocks do not respond hydrochemically to geochemical differences. Using ion proportions instead of concentrations. geochemical fingertips of magmatic stream basins were detected. Atmospheric inputs largely affect stream and spring composition. eg. by 75% regarding sodium. Only 20% of dissolved oxygen and pH variance was assigned to biological activity. while nutrient levels were consistent with the undisturbed conditions of the island. except nitrate. Small mountainous springs and brooks fed by restricted. cracked groundwater aquifers with perennial flow. despite scarce summer rainfalls. may be fueled by cloud and fog condensation. High night-day stream flow differences. high atmospheric humidity predominately occurring during the night. and low stream water travel times point out toward this phenomenon.,True,N-zdxhMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/2/473,14332988166885806853,/scholar?cites=14332988166885806853,,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/12/2/473/pdf,0,0,0

Nutrient pollution. soil erosion. and alteration in hydrology are considered the most common problems that riverine ecosystems are facing today. Not surprisingly. river monitoring activities in Europe have been intensified during the last few years to fulfil the Water Framework Directive (WFD) requirements. With this article. we present a nationwide assessment of the water quality and hydromorphological variability in Greek Rivers based on the results of the national monitoring program under the WFD. Water quality and hydromorphological data from 352 sites belonging to 221 rivers were explored with principal component analysis (PCA) to identify main environmental gradients and the variables that contribute the most to the total variance. Nitrate. phosphate. ammonium and electrical conductivity were identified as the most important water chemistry parameters. and typical vector-based spatial data analysis was applied to map their spatial distribution at sub-basin scale. In addition. we conducted simple linear models between the aforementioned parameters and the share of land uses within the basin of each sampling site in order to identify significant relationships. Agriculture was the most important land use affecting the nitrate and electrical conductivity. while artificial surfaces were the best predictor for phosphate and ammonium. Concerning the hydromorphological variability. fine types of substrate and discharge were the variables with the highest contribution to the total variance.

Different restoration practices have been tested to eliminate the impacts from eutrophication but no widely applicable methodology has been found until now. Extract of Yucca shidigera has been proved effective in reducing ammonia in livestock industry and aquaculture but have not been yet tested in freshwater ecosystems. In this study. the effects of yucca extract on the reduction of ammonia in Lake Koumoundourou have been investigated. Yucca extract was added at various concentrations to experimental tanks containing lake water and sediment. The results show that yucca extract significantly reduced the concentration of ammonia while other water quality parameters were relatively stable during the experiment. except from dissolved oxygen.

The lower Evros/Meriç River. shared by Greece and Turkey. is one of the most heavily militarized river borders in Europe and access to the river corridor is strictly restricted. This 218 km proposed green-belt conservation area has never been completely surveyed for its riparian biodiversity values. Here we provide an assessment and evidence for green-belt conservation justification for the entire portion of the Greek-Turkish river corridor for the first time. We employ satellite imagery to assess riparian corridor conditions and the distribution of natural habitat refuge environments focusing on riparian woodlands and river islands. The analysis found that nearly half of the area of the riparian green-belt is under cultivation; approximately 22% of the riparian zone is wooded. while some of these woodlands are taken over by artificial poplar plantations. The natural woodland areas are severely fragmented and usually small in extent and width being affected by frequent logging and clearing. The most extensive remaining woodlands are mapped; most of the 12 largest contiguous natural woodland are in the northern half of the river valley. Important natural habitat refuges are the river’s islands; 219 such island features are mapped from recent satellite images. and most are heavily wooded. again most are found in the northern half of the river valley.

In this study. a methodological framework is proposed for quantifying Chl-a pigments using Earth observation (EO) data from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. The first step of the methodology involves the implementation of stepwise multiple regression (MLR) analysis of the available Chl-a dataset. Then. principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to explore Greek lakes’ potential interrelationships based on their Chl-a values in conjunction with certain criteria: their characteristics (artificial/natural). typology. and climatic type. Additionally. parameters such as seasonal water sampling and the date difference between sampling and satellite overpass are taken into consideration. Next. is implemented a stepwise multiple regression analysis among different groups of cases. formed by the criteria indicated from the PCA itself. This effort aimed at exploring different remote sensing-derived Chl-a algorithms for various types of lakes. The practical use of the proposed approach was evaluated in a total of 50 lake water bodies (natural and artificial) from 2013–2018. constituting the National Lake Network Monitoring of Greece in the context of the Water Framework Directive (WFD).

This constitutes the major issue concerning river pollution in the prefecture since no treatment method is currently applied and the wastes result in nearby streams. Several chemical parameters were recorded such as total phenols. pesticide residues of 90 active substances. trace metals. nutrients and particulate organic carbon. Subsequently. the assessment method of river quality. River Habitat Survey was applied and the STAR_ICMi biological indicator was calculated. The downstream part of Arkadikos R.. as it is evident from the physicochemical and biological results. was found to be severely downgraded during the winter period of 2011 which can be partly attributed to the impact of olive oil waste waters. The system seems to recover during spring. since the values of the parameters were drastically decreased but the pollution burden is shifted …,True,okoAToYAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ellie_Anastasopoulou/publication/269635699_Assessing_Tools_and_Methods_for_Water_Quality_Monitoring_in_Medium_sized_Rivers_The_Case_of_Arcadikos_River_Messinia_Greece/links/5762797208ae244d037464f0/Assessing-Tools-and-Methods-for-Water-Quality-Monitoring-in-Medium-sized-Rivers-The-Case-of-Arcadikos-River-Messinia-Greece.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ellie_Anastasopoulou/publication/269635699_Assessing_Tools_and_Methods_for_Water_Quality_Monitoring_in_Medium_sized_Rivers_The_Case_of_Arcadikos_River_Messinia_Greece/links/5762797208ae244d037464f0/Assessing-Tools-and-Methods-for-Water-Quality-Monitoring-in-Medium-sized-Rivers-The-Case-of-Arcadikos-River-Messinia-Greece.pdf,0,0,0

Central Greece,2019,Angeliki Mentzafou and George Varlas and Elias Dimitriou and Anastasios Papadopoulos and Ioannis Pytharoulis and Petros Katsafados,7,Climate,11,129,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In this study. the physically-based hydrological model MIKE SHE was employed to investigate the effects of anthropogenic land cover changes to the hydrological cycle components of a regional watershed in Central Greece. Three case studies based on the land cover of the years 1960. 1990. and 2018 were examined. Copernicus Climate Change Service E-OBS gridded meteorological data for 45 hydrological years were used as forcing for the model. Evaluation against observational data yielded sufficient quality for daily air temperature and precipitation. Simulation results demonstrated that the climatic variabilities primarily in precipitation and secondarily in air temperature affected basin-averaged annual actual evapotranspiration and average annual river discharge. Nevertheless. land cover effects can locally outflank the impact of climatic variability as indicated by the low interannual variabilities of differences in annual actual evapotranspiration among case studies. The transition from forest to pastures or agricultural land reduced annual actual evapotranspiration and increased average annual river discharge while intensifying the vulnerability to hydrometeorological-related hazards such as droughts or floods. Hence. the quantitative assessment of land cover effects presented in this study can contribute to the design and implementation of successful land cover and climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.

Due to the significant impacts of these phenomena. it is essential to develop new and advanced early warning systems for advance preparation of the population and local authorities (civil protection. government agencies. etc.). Therefore. reliable forecasts of extreme events. with high spatial and temporal resolution and a very short time horizon are needed. due to the very fast development and localized nature of these events. In very short time-periods (up to 6 h). small-scale phenomena can be described accurately by adopting a “nowcasting” approach. providing reliable short-term forecasts and warnings. To this end. a novel nowcasting system was developed and presented in this study. combining a data assimilation system (LAPS). a large amount of observed data. including XPOL radar precipitation measurements. the Chemical Hydrological Atmospheric Ocean wave System (CHAOS). and the WRF-Hydro model. The system was evaluated on the catastrophic flash flood event that occurred in the sub-urban area of Mandra in Western Attica. Greece. on 15 November 2017. The event was one of the most catastrophic flash floods with human fatalities (24 people died) and extensive infrastructure damage. The update of the simulations with assimilated radar data improved the initial precipitation description and led to an improved simulation of the evolution of the phenomenon.

The development of large-scale water abstraction and sediment retention infrastructures has facilitated phenomena such as coastal erosion. frequent eutrophication events and sea water anoxia. The present work investigates the alterations that have been observed over the last 50 years in the area of Thermaikos Gulf. Northern Greece. with emphasis on water overexploitation impacts on the coastal system. For this purpose two different water management scenarios have been set up; one prior and one after the significant human interventions in the Thermaikos Gulf catchment (includes Aliakmonas and Axios river catchments). The hydrodynamic model ‘MIKE SHE’. and the RUSLE sediment erosion model have been used in order to quantify and assess the human impacts on the water and suspended sediment discharges into the Inner Thermaikos Gulf. according to the aforementioned scenarios. The results indicated that both water and sediment discharges have severely diminished. with reductions reaching approximately 51 and 90% for the Axios River as well as 39 and 76% for the Aliakmon River. respectively. Agricultural and hydropower production activities with the associated dams are the main actors of these impacts.

Ergene River. one of the main tributaries of Evros. affects the water quality of the later. due to industrial. agricultural and domestic pressures applied on its catchment area. In order to examine the diffusion of nitrate concentrations downstream of the Evros and Ergene rivers junction. a water sampling campaign and a hydrochemical survey was conducted. while a coupled hydrological/hydraulic and water quality model was setup. The tool used in the present project is the physically distributed modelling system MIKE SHE/MIKE 11. In general. the hydrological. hydrodynamic and water quality simulation of Evros sub-catchment was sufficient. Some inaccuracies were observed at the upstream observation points of head elevation of saturated zone. while water level simulation of the river was more satisfactory.

Zeri,,,,323-328,Grafima,Identifying the dominant pollution pressures and establishing the associated pressure–impact relationship in a river catchment is a prerequisite for integrated water resources management according to the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Sperchios River is located in Central Greece. close to the historic area of Thermopyles. Sperchios catchment has a total extent of 1828 km 2. with a mean altitude of 636 m and includes many ecologically important areas that are protected under the framework of Natura 2000 network (Oiti mountain. Sperchios river valley and Maliakos gulf). However. the particular river constitutes the recipient of substantial agrochemical loads from intensively cultivated areas in the Prefecture of Fthiotida as well as wastewater from nearby villages. cities and small industries. This has progressively led to the environmental degradation of the area and particularly of the river’s water quality which constitutes a threat for the biological resources of both the river and Maliakos gulf. The Institute of Inland Waters of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research undertook a project in 2009 to monitor the water quality status of Sperchios river. identify the pollution sources of the particular catchment and propose relevant management and mitigation measures. The results indicated that the central part of the catchment can be characterized as of moderate to poor water quality as far as nitrates are concerned. This illustrates a strong influence from agrochemicals that becomes evident in the river during the end of irrigation period (September).

Whereas coasts. seas. and oceans sustain a great proportion of the human population. CES provided by these ecosystems have remained largely unexplored. Therefore. our aims were (1) to analyse the state of research on marine and coastal CES. (2) to identify knowledge gaps. and (3) to pinpoint research priorities and the way forward. To accomplish these objectives. we did a systematic review of the scientific literature and synthesised a subset of 72 peer-reviewed publications. Results show that research on marine and coastal CES is scarce compared to other ecosystem service categories. It is primarily focused on local and regional sociocultural or economic assessments of coastal ecosystems from Western Europe and North America. Such research bias narrows the understanding of social-ecological interactions to a western cultural setting. undermining the role of other worldviews in the understanding of a wide range of interactions between cultural practices and ecosystems worldwide. Additionally. we have identified clusters of co-occurring drivers of change affecting marine and coastal habitats and their CES.

Atherina boyeri Risso. 1810 in the mouth of the Mala Neretva River were studied by examining the stomach contents of 1236 fishes collected from March 2001 to February 2002. Thirteen different food categories were identified. The greatest diversity was recorded in winter. especially in January. when 11 categories were present. The minimum (4) was in September. and was associated with the highest number of empty stomachs. Marine and estuarine species represented the bulk of the prey. while typically fresh-water species (Daphnia spp. and Cyclops spp.) were found only sporadically. Crustaceans were the most common prey and. of these. the most common were copepods (45%). followed by gammarid amphipods (34%). cladocerans (13%). decapod larvae (12%) and mysids (8%). Insects represented 7%. The percentage number of prey showed high seasonal variations. Copepods dominated in autumn and winter. cyclopoids in April. poecilostomatoids and harpacticoids in December. and calanoids in January and February. Decapod larvae dominated in March-May. and mysids in July-August.

While landclaim for agricultural purposes through poldering and building dykes constitutes the major historical anthropogenic impact. industrialisation and the development of the modern Western economy and culture has brought many other uses of estuarine areas (Davidson et al.. 1991). The progressive loss of estuarine areas remains a serious threat to the preservation of estuarine biotopes and the integrity of estuaries as a whole. Many estuaries have undergone such extensive changes that their hydrological. chemical and/or biological functioning has been signifi cantly altered. In order to provide facilities such as access to harbours. fl ood control or defences. industrial development and waste disposal. estuaries have in many cases been transformed into channels where the natural dynamics of sediment transport and water movements are inhibited. Even the almost total loss of entire estuarine areas has occurred. for example in the Tees estuary. north-east England. where 80% of the lower wetland area has been lost (Davidson et al.. 1991). Additionally. over the past decades throughout Europe the quality of the estuarine environment has deteriorated in such a way to remove wildlife (see Chapter 7).

Harpacticoid copepods were the most common prey (39%) in these samples. followed by insects (32%) and cladocerans (12%). All other prey accounted for less than 4%. Insects represented 99% of prey in the stomachs of specimens sampled from the freshwater Crna Rijeka River. Thin-lipped mullet juveniles were not found on sandy beaches or natural bays around the port. It thus appears that juveniles find the port area to be a habitat with the favorable characteristics of a brackish water nursery: of predators. lower salinity. and high food availability. These all promote better survival and recruitment in this area of the Croatian Adriatic.,True,GcQMvAgAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,21,https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak_download&id_clanak_jezik=23970,12357224501290287430,/scholar?cites=12357224501290287430,,https://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak_download&id_clanak_jezik=23970,0,0,0

A 2 (diets: extruded pellet and moist pellet)×2 (feeding frequencies: two and three times daily)×2 (water temperatures: 12 and 17°C) factorial design with three replications was used. After 60 days of feeding. the feeding frequency did not significantly affect growth performance of fish. Weight gain. daily feed intake. feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio were significantly (P<0.05) higher for fish reared at the higher water temperature. At the same water temperature. weight gain. feed efficiency. and protein efficiency ratio were significantly (P<0.05) higher for fish fed the extruded pellet than moist pellet. The results of this study indicate that feeding frequency of two times daily is …,True,GcQMvAgAAAAJ:5awf1xo2G04C,20,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01392.x,12614309554587599897,/scholar?cites=12614309554587599897,,,0,0,0

The species is intensively exploited in the area as live bait for hand lines and long lines both for professional and sport fishermen. The study area is a closed bay in western Greece with a small opening which connects it to the Ionian Sea. Longevity of the species in the study area was found to be 4+ years. Females’ total length ranged between 18 and 54 mm; for males it ranged between 16 and 58 mm. The von Bertalanffy parameters for males were L∞= 60.30 mm. K= 0.520 per year and t0=-0.0166 years; for females they were L∞= 58.80 mm. K= 0.621 per year and t0=-0.1261 years. Overall von Bertalanffy equation parameters were L∞= 61.05 mm. K= 0.521 per year and t0= 0.086 years. Maximum weight was estimated as 3.440 g at L∞ based on the length-weight relationship. Mortality estimates were Z= 1.510 per year. M= 0.928 per year and F= 0.582 per year resulting in an exploitation ratio of E= 39%. Using the above values. yield per recruit was estimated at 2.97 g/year at Fmax levels of 0.750 per year and Eopt= 50%. Overall length-weight relationship was estimated as: W= 0.01589 TL2. 972. r2= 0.886.

Published data addressing acceptable storage times and temperatures before process CB collections are inconsistent. For example. Antonenas and coworkers1 reported that the optimum temperature for maintaining the viability of freshly harvested hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is 2 to 8 C. They reported mean losses of CD34+ cells of 9.4 and 28 percent at 24 and 72 hours at 2 to 8 C. compared mean losses of 21.9 and 43.3 percent at 24 and 72 hours for room temperature storage. Hubel and colleagues2 reported recoveries of CB mononuclear cells (MNCs) stored at 4 C of 95 and 81 percent. compared to recoveries of 88 and 56 percent after storage at room temperature. at 24 and 72 hours. respectively. Rogers and colleagues3 reported significant losses of nucleated and CD34+ cells after storage at room temperature for up to 24 hours. In contrast. Isoyama and coworkers4 reported that CB nucleated cells maintained significant viability at room temperature for 24 hours or longer. and Campos and colleagues5 reported a 48-hour recovery for total nucleated cells of 74 8 percent at 4 C and greater than 95 percent at 25 C. Based on these data. CB processing could be delayed for as long as 72 hours after collection. In an attempt to resolve the apparent discrepancies among these studies. we evaluated the effects of CB storage time and temperature on the number of viable hematopoietic progenitors. viable MNCs. and colonyforming unit (CFU) formation.

Little is known about the true rates of depression. it correlates or how well it is treated. This research is part of a series examining health status of older people using the Geriatric depression scale-15 (GDS-15). Methods: One thousand and nine hundred seventy five (1975) older people living in Razavi Khorasan province were studied using the cluster sampling method. The Persian version of GDS-15 was completed based on filling in questionnaires and after recognition of sample size of each city. Admission and data analyzing was followed by examining the relationship between depression and place of living (rural and urban). education. gender. type of living (alone or with family). occupation. source of income. and supporting system (such as charities. etc).Results: The subjects' mean (±SD) age was 71.14 (±7.78) years (range: 60-98) and 52.9% of the subjects were female. According GDS score. 23.5% of the subjects suffered from depression. The GDS score was significantly related to type of living (alone or with family). source of income. and supporting system (such as charities)(p< 0.01). The depression scores in elderly with family support was significantly higher than those living with personal wealth and retirement salary (p< 0.01).

To develop a blood donation culture among university students. it is important to identify factors used to predict their intent to donate blood. This study attempted to develop a valid and reliable measurement tool to be employed in assessing variables in a blood donation behavior model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). a commonly used theoretical foundation for social psychology studies. We employed an elicitation study. in which we determined the commonly held behavioral and normative beliefs about blood donation. We used the results of the elicitation study and a standard format for creating questionnaire items for all constructs of the TPB model to prepare the first draft of the measurement tool. After piloting the questionnaire. we prepared the final draft of the questionnaire to be used in our main study. Examination of internal consistency using Chronbach’s alpha coefficient and item-total statistics indicated the constructs “Intention” and “Self efficacy” had the highest reliability. Removing one item from each of the constructs.“Attitude.”“Subjective norm.”“Self efficacy.” or “Behavioral beliefs”. can considerably increase the reliability of the measurement tool. however. such action is controversial. especially for the variables “attitude” and “subjective norm.” We consider all the items of our first draft questionnaire in our main study to make it a reliable measurement tool.,True,ELv9a0IAAAAJ:aqlVkmm33-oC,47,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehrdad_Jalalian/publication/259479471_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_QUESTIONNAIRE_FOR_ASSESSING_FACTORS_PREDICTING_BLOOD_DONATION_AMONG_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS_A_PILOT_STUDY/links/0deec52c14b63d9780000000/DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-QUESTIONNAIRE-FOR-ASSESSING-FACTORS-PREDICTING-BLOOD-DONATION-AMONG-UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS-A-PILOT-STUDY.pdf,17810283553492558307,/scholar?cites=17810283553492558307,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehrdad_Jalalian/publication/259479471_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_QUESTIONNAIRE_FOR_ASSESSING_FACTORS_PREDICTING_BLOOD_DONATION_AMONG_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS_A_PILOT_STUDY/links/0deec52c14b63d9780000000/DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-QUESTIONNAIRE-FOR-ASSESSING-FACTORS-PREDICTING-BLOOD-DONATION-AMONG-UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS-A-PILOT-STUDY.pdf,0,0,0

It has been suggested that utilizing a transverse or oblique rather than a midline incision may influence other parameters such as duration of surgery. recovery and complication rates. However. there is a little study as to whether a particular incision confers any advantage. The aim of the study was to determine whether a dorso-lateral incision or a transverse incision confers any advantage to the rats. Ninety five 16 weeks age female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups. Ovariectomy was preceded either by a single dorso-lateral incision (in the first group. n= 45) or a single transverse lateral incision (in the second group. n= 50). Animals in group A (vertical incision. n= 45) had a mean weight of 259.11±20.31 and those in group B (transverse incision. n= 50) weighted 254.20±20.31 g. There was significant differences in the duration of surgery in the two groups (p< 0.001). Although wound healing time for group B was slightly shorter than group A (9.46±0.973 day vs 9.78±1.380 day); none of the distributions of wound length and healing percentage per day showed significant variation between these two groups. The success of a surgery procedure performed through an abdominal incision depends on careful selection of the incision site and proper closure of the wound. In comparison of these two types incision for ovariectomy of rat. the operation as conducted in group B (Transverse Incision) was technically easier. less time consuming and less wound healing duration.,True,ELv9a0IAAAAJ:O3NaXMp0MMsC,44,https://www.academia.edu/download/46522711/9.pdf,2798379809077149909,/scholar?cites=2798379809077149909,,https://www.academia.edu/download/46522711/9.pdf,0,0,0

Identifying the factors that influence patient delay could provide information for adopting strategies that shorten this delay. The aim of this meta-ethnography was to synthesize existing qualitative evidence in order to gain a new understanding of help seeking behavior in women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms and to determine the factors that influence patient delay.  Methods The design was a meta-ethnography approach. A systematic search of the articles was performed in different databases including Elsevier. PubMed. ProQuest and SCOPUS. Qualitative studies with a focus on help seeking behaviors in women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms and patient delay. published in the English language between 1990 and 2013 were included. The quality appraisal of the articles was carried out using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative research checklist and 13 articles met the inclusion criteria. The synthesis was conducted according to Noblit and Hare’s meta-ethnographic approach (1988). through reciprocal translational analysis and lines-of-argument.  Findings The synthesis led to identification of eight repeated key concepts including: symptom detection. initial symptom interpretation. symptom monitoring. social interaction. emotional reaction. priority of medical help. appraisal of health services and personal-environmental factors.

However. few studies on sexuality are based on a rights framework. The unspoken nature of sexuality in Iranian culture has led to a lack of national studies on the topic. The objective of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of married Iranian women on sexual rights in their sexual relationships. In this grounded theory study. 37 participants (25 married women. 5 husbands. and 7 midwives) were selected. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and analyzed through open. axial. and selective coding using MAXQDA software version 2007. The analysis revealed the core category of “sexual interaction in the shadow of silence.” The interrelated categories subsumed under the core category included adopting a strategy of silence. trying to negotiate sex. seeking help. and sexual adjustment. The silence originating from women’s interactions with their families and society. from girlhood to womanhood. was identified as the core concept in Iranian women’s experiences of sexual rights. A focus on husbands’ roles seems salient because they can direct or alter some learned feminine roles. especially silence regarding sexual matters. which then affects the realization of women’s sexual rights.,True,RLgD9BQAAAAJ:3fE2CSJIrl8C,28,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/520827/abs/,3539643033563711245,/scholar?cites=3539643033563711245,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/520827/abs/,0,0,0

Microdeletion of the long arm of Y chromosome has been seen in about 7% of infertile men. The importance of these microdeletions lies in the possibility of their occurrence in the off-springs in ART and their de novo appearance.Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was performed on 47 individuals with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia. The cases were recruited when they attended Imam Reza Hospital in Mashad during 2006-2008. Hormone profile. including FSH. was measured and karyotyping. testicular biopsy and Y chromosome microdeletion detection. using 11 pairs of sequence-tagged site (STS method) sets which were specific for AZF and SRY loci. were performed.Results: Three out of four patients with azoospermia had Y chromosome microdeletion …,True,1lAIt8wAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,2,https://search.proquest.com/openview/1e41e94da50626300e1924b61c63eb2a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=105706,1858209790753518909,/scholar?cites=1858209790753518909,,,0,0,0

Genetic variants in 8q24. 21 including rs10505477 and rs6983267 have been hypothesized to be involved in susceptibility to CRC. This study aims to investigate the possible association between these loci and their haplotypes with CRC risk in Iranian population. Materials and Methods: Subjects were recruited from two hospitals in Tehran. The rs10505477 and rs6983267 polymorphisms were genotyped by TaqMan real time PCR using subject genomic DNA. extracted either from formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissue of patients or from blood of the controls by standard methods. Results: A total of 715 subjects (380 CRC patients and 335 matched controls) were genotyped in this study. Allele and genotype analysis of the rs10505477 and rs6983267 polymorphisms by gender. age at diagnosis. tumor location. tumor grade. and tumor node metastasis (TNM) showed no significant association with CRC risk. There was a significant relationship between GG haplotype and susceptibility to age at diagnosis for both< 60 and (p= 0.0005 and p= 0.000004. respectively) and between GT and CRC in the age at diagnosis (Table 3: p= 0.031).

The results obtained from this study indicated that NRF had a strong ability to quench HSA at λ ex= 280 nm. In addition. a slight blue shift occurred. which suggested that the microenvironment of the protein became more hydrophobic after addition of NRF. The interaction between the NRF and HSA. whether in the absence or presence of an EMF. was considered to be a static quenching mechanism. Moreover. synchronous fluorescence demonstrated that the microenvironment around Trp became modified. Data of HSA-NRF in the presence of EMFs between 1 Hz–1 MHz confirmed the results of quenching and blue shifts. Corresponding Stern-Volmer plots were also drawn and the resultant Ksv and kq values were compared. Moreover. the binding parameters. including the number of binding sites. the binding constant and the distance. r. between donor and acceptor. were calculated based on Förster’s non-radiative energy transfer theory. According to far and near UV-CD. the formation of the complex caused changes of the secondary and tertiary structures of HSA.

The purpose of the present study was to study the effects of Ramadan fasting with or without weight-lifting training on vascular volumes and selected hematological indices in young male weight-lifters. Blood samples were taken at 24h before and 24h after the last day of holy Ramadan fasting period and weight-lifting training for determination of the selected red and white blood cells compositions. The Vascular volumes (Blood. Red cells. and plasma volumes) were determined and calculated by using both hemoglobin and hematocrit estimations before and after Ramadan fasting with or without weight-lifting training. The results indicate that red cell volume and MCHC were significantly decreased and increased in fasting group (P< 0.05) respectively. The percentages of hematocrit were significantly low in both training and fasting groups. A higher and significant platelet count was found in training group. The present data indicate that weight-lifting training during the holy Ramadan in compare to fasting had no impact on red and white cells composition exception on platelet count and Hematocrit.

To develop a blood donation culture among university students. it is important to identify factors used to predict their intent to donate blood. This study attempted to develop a valid and reliable measurement tool to be employed in assessing variables in a blood donation behavior model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). a commonly used theoretical foundation for social psychology studies. We employed an elicitation study. in which we determined the commonly held behavioral and normative beliefs about blood donation. We used the results of the elicitation study and a standard format for creating questionnaire items for all constructs of the TPB model to prepare the first draft of the measurement tool. After piloting the questionnaire. we prepared the final draft of the questionnaire to be used in our main study. Examination of internal consistency using Chronbach’s alpha coefficient and item-total statistics indicated the constructs “Intention” and “Self efficacy” had the highest reliability. Removing one item from each of the constructs.“Attitude.”“Subjective norm.”“Self efficacy.” or “Behavioral beliefs”. can considerably increase the reliability of the measurement tool. however. such action is controversial. especially for the variables “attitude” and “subjective norm.” We consider all the items of our first draft questionnaire in our main study to make it a reliable measurement tool.,True,b5Chy7AAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,47,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehrdad_Jalalian/publication/259479471_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_QUESTIONNAIRE_FOR_ASSESSING_FACTORS_PREDICTING_BLOOD_DONATION_AMONG_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS_A_PILOT_STUDY/links/0deec52c14b63d9780000000/DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-QUESTIONNAIRE-FOR-ASSESSING-FACTORS-PREDICTING-BLOOD-DONATION-AMONG-UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS-A-PILOT-STUDY.pdf,17810283553492558307,/scholar?cites=17810283553492558307,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mehrdad_Jalalian/publication/259479471_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_QUESTIONNAIRE_FOR_ASSESSING_FACTORS_PREDICTING_BLOOD_DONATION_AMONG_UNIVERSITY_STUDENTS_A_PILOT_STUDY/links/0deec52c14b63d9780000000/DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-QUESTIONNAIRE-FOR-ASSESSING-FACTORS-PREDICTING-BLOOD-DONATION-AMONG-UNIVERSITY-STUDENTS-A-PILOT-STUDY.pdf,0,0,0

It has been reported that tumor hypoxia can: activate angiogenesis. thereby enhancing invasiveness and risk of metastasis; increase survival of tumor. as well as suppress anti-tumor immunity and hamper the therapeutic response. Hypoxia mediates these effects by several potential mechanisms: altering gene expression. the activation of oncogenes. inactivation of suppressor genes. reducing genomic stability and clonal selection.

Considering the chronic inflammatory nature of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease. we examined whether or not the administration of human placental extract is able to attenuate the neurological symptoms detected in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. The injected myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induced EAE in mice. and treatment began from day 4 post-injection by intraperitoneal administration of 0.2 mg/kg human placental extract. repeated every other day up to day 31 post-injection. At the end of the treatment. luxol fast blue (LBS) staining and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were performed to evaluate the demyelination of neurons and inflammatory responses. respectively. Further assessed were the serum concentrations of IL-23 and IL-27. The administration of human placental extract was able to significantly reduce the mean clinical score in EAE mice. decrease the pro-inflammatory process and attenuate neural demyelination. Moreover. while the serum concentration of IL-23 was significantly diminished in the EAE mice receiving human placental extract compared to the non-treated EAE group. IL-27 concentration was significantly increased. Our findings demonstrated the administration of human placental extract could significantly attenuate the neurological symptoms in the EAE model of MS in part through modulating the serum levels of IL-23 and IL-27 and enhancing neuroprotection and myelin repair.,True,ouFFbQ4AAAAJ:1Ye0OR6EYb4C,0,https://autoimmunhighlights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13317-020-00137-x,,,,https://autoimmunhighlights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13317-020-00137-x,0,0,0

There are more than 200 active ingredients in this resin including acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA). We proposed that AKBA can improve memory impairment induced by cerebral inflammation following the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Forty male rats were grouped and received the following treatments: Control (diluted DMSO + saline). LPS (diluted DMSO + 1 mg/kg LPS). LPS- AKBA 5 and LPS- AKBA 10 (5 or 10 mg/ kg AKBA before LPS). Morris water maze (MWM). passive avoidance (PA) and biochemical tests were carried out. Pre-treatment with both doses of AKBA improved memory performance in MWM and PA tests (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). Pre-treatment by AKBA improved the levels of hippocampal IL-10 (P < 0.001). BDNF (P < 0.001). CAT (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001).
