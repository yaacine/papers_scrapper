We examined interspecific differences in development. fecundity. activity. and susceptibility to predation. We found that O. insidiosus is able to prey effectively on F. occidentalis. F. tritici and F. bispinosa. However. less mobile prey. such as larvae and adults of F. occidentalis. tend to be more vulnerable to predation than are more mobile prey. such as adults of F. bispinosa. Previous research has demonstrated. both theoretically and empirically. that the predator O. insidiosus has the capacity to regulate populations of thrips. but our results indicate that the regulatory ability of O. insidiosus will be mediated by species-specific behavioral differences of their thrips prey. are native to this region. whereas F. occidentalis is an invasive species that has been present in the southeastern USA for just over 20 years (Beshear. 1983).

100015,Differential Predation by Orius Insidiosus (Say) on Frankliniella Occidentalis (Pergande) and Frankliniella Bispinosa (Morgan) in Sweet Pepper,2005,Scot Michael Waring,,,,,,"Thrips are minute insects (between 1 to 4 mm) classified in the insect order Thysanoptera (fringed-wing bearers). They were first described in 1744 by De Geer who called them Physapus. however the genus was renamed Thrips in 1758 by Linnaeus. In 1836. the English entomologist Haliday raised the status of the thrips taxon to order and renamed them Thysanoptera. although the members of the order are still commonly referred to as thrips. A common vernacular name for thrips is"" thunder flies."" which comes from association of dispersal after springtime storms. The order Thysanoptera is divided into two suborders: Tubulifera and Terebrantia and is further subdivided into eight families containing approximately 5000 described species (Mound 1997). Tubulifera and Terebrantia differ in respect to body. specifically abdominal shape. wing structure and number of larval instars (Tubulifera have an extra pupal stage). The seven families that make up Terebrantia are Uzelothripidae. Merothripidae. Aeolothripidae. Adiheterothripidae. Fauriellidae. Heterothripidae and Thripidae. Combined. these families account for about 1900 of the approximately 5000 known species.

Examples of apparent competition typically involve a non-native consumer disproportionately affecting one host population in the presence of another.  My research finds evidence for apparent competition between two herbs. one invasive and one endemic. and mediated by an endemic insect herbivore.  The European pasture herb Jacobaea vulgaris (formerly Senecio jacobaea). is an invasive weed in several parts of the world. including New Zealand.  New Zealand is also home to 19 native species of Senecio – thirteen of which are endemic – that support an endemic insect fauna.  Some of these insects have since expanded their host range to include the invasive J. vulgaris.  I examined the relationships between one of those herbivores. the New Zealand magpie moth (Nyctemera annulata. Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). J. vulgaris and one endemic (S. wairauensis) and two native host plants (S. minimus and S. quadridentatus).  In my laboratory assays. magpie moth larvae found J. vulgaris as attractive as native host plants and larvae fed only J. vulgaris developed at comparable rates to those fed only native hosts.  My landscape surveys revealed a strong association between J. vulgaris infestations. magpie moth abundance and increased levels of herbivore damage of the endemic S. wairauensis. Likewise. S. wairauensis was more likely to be present in transects where J. vulgaris was rare. There is convincing anecdotal evidence that the native magpie moth became far more abundant because of an invasive weed and my study suggests that this detrimentally affects …,True,bQxa_PsAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC,0,http://dspace.lincoln.ac.nz/handle/10182/4534,,,,http://dspace.lincoln.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10182/4534/Waring_phd.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

MPSIIIB is characterised by behavioural difficulties. cognitive and later motor decline. with death in the second decade of life. Most of these neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases lack effective treatments. We recently described significant reductions of accumulated heparan sulphate substrate in liver of a mouse model of MPSIIIB using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein.  Methodology/Principal Findings We report here that high doses of genistein aglycone. given continuously over a 9 month period to MPSIIIB mice. significantly reduce lysosomal storage. heparan sulphate substrate and neuroinflammation in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. resulting in correction of the behavioural defects observed. Improvements in synaptic vesicle protein expression and secondary storage in the cerebral cortex were also observed.  Conclusions/Significance Genistein may prove useful as a substrate reduction agent to delay clinical onset of MPSIIIB and. due to its multimodal action. may provide a treatment adjunct for several other neurodegenerative metabolic diseases.,True,It19qqsAAAAJ:mVmsd5A6BfQC,135,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014192,14772259585363886143,/scholar?cites=14772259585363886143,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014192,0,0,0

100033,The encapsulation of idarubicin within liposomes using the novel EDTA ion gradient method ensures improved drug retention in vitro and in vivo,2010,Jerzy Gubernator and Grzegorz Chwastek and Mariola Korycińska and Maria Stasiuk and Grzegorz Grynkiewicz and Felicitas Lewrick and Regine Süss and Arkadiusz Kozubek,146,Journal of Controlled Release,1,68-75,Elsevier,The purpose of this study was to design a new stable liposomal formulation for the anticancer drug idarubicin. Idarubicin is a relatively hydrophobic member of the anthracycline family. It exhibits pronounced bilayer interactions leading to rapid in vivo drug release from liposomes. This rapid drug leakage is due to the presence of cholesterol and charged lipids in the liposomal bilayer. Therefore. a novel method of remote drug loading was developed to prevent rapid drug release from PEGylated cholesterol-containing liposomes. This method uses EDTA disodium or diammonium salt as an agent to form low solubility complexes between the drug and EDTA molecules inside the liposomes. thus yielding improved drug retention. The efficiency of idarubicin encapsulation is close to 98% at a drug to lipid molar ratio of 1:5. An in vitro long-term storage experiment confirmed the high stability of the liposomes.

The antiproliferative potential of synthetic genistein derivatives used alone or in combination with ionizing radiation was evaluated in cancer cell lines using clonogenic assay. EGFR phosphorylation was assessed with western blotting. Genistein derivatives inhibited clonogenic growth of HCT 116 cancer cells additively or synergistically when used in combination with ionizing radiation. and decreased EGFR activation. Our preclinical evaluation of genistein-derived EGFR inhibitors suggests that these compounds are much more potent sensitizers of cells to radiation than the parent isoflavonoid. genistein and indicate that these compounds may be useful in the treatment of colon cancer with radiation therapy.
