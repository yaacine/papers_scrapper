Transmission electron micrographs clearly demonstrated that a− Si QDs were formed in the silicon nitride. Photoluminescence and optical absorption energy measurement of a− Si QDs with various sizes revealed that tuning of the photoluminescence emission from 2.0 to 2.76 eV is possible by controlling the size of the a− Si QD.

The fitted photoluminescence peak energy as E(eV)=1.16+11.8∕d2 is evidence for the quantum confinement effect in silicon nanocrystals.

Eventually. heat removal is becoming a crucial issue because the requirement of high brightness necessitates high-operating current densities that would trigger more joule heating. Here we demonstrate that the embedded graphene oxide in a gallium nitride light-emitting diode alleviates the self-heating issues by virtue of its heat-spreading ability and reducing the thermal boundary resistance. The fabrication process involves the generation of scalable graphene oxide microscale patterns on a sapphire substrate. followed by its thermal reduction and epitaxial lateral overgrowth of gallium nitride in a metal-organic chemical vapour deposition system under one-step process.

Compared with conventional ZrO2. ZrOxNy exhibits excellent electrical characteristics such as high accumulation capacitance. low leakage current density. and superior thermal stability. Based on high resolution transmission electron microscope analysis of both ZrO2 and ZrOxNy samples which had been annealed at 800 °C for 5 min. the ZrO2 exhibited a polycrystalline state but the ZrOxNy was amorphous in structure.

It offers higher spatial resolution by utilizing conventional electron backscattered diffraction equipment on electron-transparent samples. A successful attempt has been made to reveal nano-oxide grain structures as well as ultrafine severely deformed metallic grains. The effect of electron beam current was studied. Higher beam currents enhance pattern contrast and intensity. Lower detector exposure times could be employed to accelerate the acquisition time and minimize drift and carbon contamination.

The results show that both tensile strength and elongation increase and the balance of tensile strengthelongation are improved upon nitrogen addition to the TRIP steel. It was found that the density of AlN precipitates increases with addition of nitrogen. The volume fraction of retained austenite increases due to AlN precipitation. because the precipitates retard the transformation of austenite during cooling and austempering. As a larger volume fraction of austenite remained after annealing has been transformed to martensite during deformation. elongation as well as strength has increased in the nitrogen added steel. It is also observed that the average grain size of ferrite and bainite decreases because of AlN precipitation that hinders grain growth. The refinement of ferrite and bainite by AlN precipitates also contributes to the increase in the strength of nitrogen added steels.,True,HE5L9rgAAAAJ:8k81kl-MbHgC,27,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/46/4/46_4_599/_article/-char/ja/,3850570121412724247,/scholar?cites=3850570121412724247,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/isijinternational/46/4/46_4_599/_pdf,0,0,0

From the studies of storage modulus of the EVA with VA content in the solid temperature range (about −70 to 50 °C). the storage modulus decreased with increasing the VA content. This result suggested that the crystallinity of the EVA affected the storage modulus of the EVA because of the weak crosslinking of the EVA by DCP.

The physicochemical and mechanical interfacial properties of the DGEBA/ECO blends were investigated. As a result. the thermal stability of the cured epoxy blends showed a maximum value in the presence of 10 wt.‐% ECO content. which was attributed to the excellent network structure in the DGEBA/ECO blends. The storage modulus and glass transition temperature of the blends were lower than those of neat epoxy resins. The mechanical interfacial properties of the cured specimens were significantly increased with increasing the ECO content. This could be interpreted in terms of the addition of larger soft segments of ECO into the epoxy resins and thus reducing the crosslinking density of the epoxy network. which results in increasing toughness …,True,dzIIsgYAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C,168,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/macp.200400214,8775937181099419508,/scholar?cites=8775937181099419508,,,0,0,0

Imatinib-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity partially reduces SIRT1 expression and SIRT1 inhibition further sensitizes CML cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis.

It is a start to understand the role of operations strategies in supply chain design. We adopt structural equation modelling to test the relationships based on data collected from 604 Chinese manufacturers. The results show that a lean supply chain is appropriate for firms placing higher priorities on cost. quality and delivery strategies. while an agile supply chain is appropriate for firms competing on the flexibility strategy. Furthermore. both lean and agile SCSs require higher levels of SCI in terms of internal and external integration. but lean SCSs have a significantly higher impact on external integration than agile SCSs.

The aim of this study was to examine the gender disparities in the prevalence of childhood obesity over time. The standardized prevalence of obesity in Chinese children increased rapidly during the past 25 years from 0.2% in 1985 to 8.1% in 2010. The increasing trend was significant in all age subgroups (p<0.01). Although the prevalence of obesity continuously increased in both boys and girls. the changing pace in boys was faster than that in girls. Age-specific prevalence odds ratios (PORs) of boys versus girls for obesity increased over time during the 25 year period. The prevalence of obesity in boys was significantly higher than in girls in all age-specific subgroups from 1991 and after. The gradually expanding gender disparity suggests the prevalence of obesity in boys contribute to a large and growing proportion of obese children.

The surface functionalization of CNTs was carried out by using diazonium reagents with 4-substituted aniline. The results strongly suggest that the type of functional groups on the CNTs strongly influences the cyclization mechanism of PAN during the stabilization process. The nitrile of PAN in F–Ph–CNT/PAN composite was cyclized through the free radical reaction during thermal stabilization whereas nitrile of PAN in COOH–Ph–CNT/PAN composite underwent cyclization via the ionic reaction due to the acid groups on the surfaces of the CNTs. The fluoro functional groups on the CNTs can act as effective external initiators for nitrile cyclization in homo PAN. in contrast to acid functional groups.

For use in the form of fabrics that can maintain such properties. individual CNTs should be held together in fibers or made into yarns twisted out of the fibers. Typical methods that are used for such purposes include (a) surfactant-based coagulation spinning. which injects a polymeric binder between CNTs to form fibers;(b) liquid-crystalline spinning. which uses the nature of CNTs to form liquid crystals under certain conditions;(c) direct spinning. which can produce CNT fibers or yarns at the same time as synthesis by introducing a carbon source into a vertical furnace; and (d) forest spinning. which draws and twists CNTs grown vertically on a substrate. However. it is difficult for those CNT fibers to express the excellent properties of individual CNTs as they are.

1214112,A three-stage methodology for design evaluation in product development,2013,Faiz Mohd Turan,,,,,,In order to remain competitive in today’s technologically driven world. the faster and more efficient development of innovative products has become the focus for manufacturing companies. In tandem with this. design evaluation plays a critical role in the early phases of product development. because it has significant impact on the downstream development processes as well as on the success of the product being developed. Owing to the pressure of primary factors. such as customer expectations. technical specifications and cost and time constraints. designers have to adopt various techniques for evaluating design alternatives in order to make the right decisions as early as possible. In this work. a novel three-stage methodology for design evaluation has been developed. The preliminary stage screens all the criteria from different viewpoints using House of Quality (HoQ). The second stage uses a Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) to obtain the alternatives weighting and the final stage verifies the ranking of the alternatives by a Rough-Grey Analysis. This method will enable designers to make better-informed decisions before finalising their choice. Case examples from industry are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology. The result of the examples shows that the integration of Fuzzy-AHP with HoQ and Rough-Grey Analysis provides a novel alternative to existing methods of design evaluation.,True,W9AVZwUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,9,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8159378777822814428&hl=en&oi=scholarr,8159378777822814428,/scholar?cites=8159378777822814428,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/20350108.pdf,0,0,0

1214125,Is the herbicide glyphosate really safe?,2017,DANIEL O AIKHUELE and FAIZ M TURAN,112,Current Science,1,11,,Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is one of the most commonly used and largest selling herbicide worldwide. It is a non-selective (broad-spectrum). systemic and effective herbicide. Glyphosate was first registered by an US-based corporation in 1974. Since its introduction. the use of glyphosate has increased rapidly. Sharp rise in its use was also noticed with the introduction of genetically modified (GM) glyphosatetolerant crops. It is registered for use in more than 130 countries. It controls annual and perennial weeds in various crops. orchards. plantations. pastures. lawns. gardens. forestry. roadsides and aquatic weeds. Glyphosate is rapidly translocated throughout the plant. The movement is mainly basipetal. It shows mobility through phloem. although mobility in xylem has also been reported. It tends to accumulate in plant regions with actively dividing cells. Glyphosate is soluble in water (12.0 g/litre). It inhibits the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. ie L-phenylalanine. L-tryptophan and L-tyrosine by inhibiting the shikimic acid pathway. This is done by competitively blocking the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS. EC 2.5. 1.19). a key enzyme of the shikimic acid pathway. EPSPS is required in plants for synthesis of aromatic amino acids (L-tryptophan. L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine) and other compounds. including vitamins. plant growth substance and lignin. These aromatic amino acids. besides being used for the synthesis of proteins. are also utilized as precursors of numerous natural products. such as pigments. alkaloids. hormones and cell-wall components in plants.

Observation and investigation based on a real-life tile production line revealed that the five main uncertain variables are demand rate. breakdown time. scrap rate. setup time. and lead time. The volatile nature of these random variables was observed over a specific period of 104 weeks. The processes were sequential and multi-stage. These five uncertain variables of production were modelled to reflect the performance of overall production by applying Bayesian inference using Gibbs sampling. The application of Bayesian inference for handling production uncertainties showed a robust model with 2.5 per cent mean absolute percentage error. It is recommended to consider the five main uncertain variables that are introduced in this study for production decision-making.

Analyzing and modeling of production throughput is complex in today’s dynamic production systems due to uncertainties of production system. The main reasons are that uncertainties are materialized when the production line faces changes in setup time. machinery break down. lead time of manufacturing. and scraps. Besides. demand changes are fluctuating from time to time for each product type. These uncertainties affect the production performance. This paper proposes Bayesian inference for throughput modeling under five production uncertainties. Bayesian model utilized prior distributions related to previous information about the uncertainties where likelihood distributions are associated to the observed data. Gibbs sampling algorithm as the robust procedure of Monte Carlo Markov chain was employed for sampling unknown parameters and estimating the posterior mean of uncertainties. The Bayesian model was validated with respect to convergence and efficiency of its outputs.

An Environmental Impact Framework for Evaluating Construction Projects Delays. Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, Detroit, Michigan, USA, September",,23-25,,The modern business environment is operating in a highly turbulent time. Demand for operational activities to achieve effectiveness and efficiency. the environment has increased the need for organizational accountability both in private and public sectors. Meanwhile. one noteworthy gap in the management of projects is considering projects as systems existing in isolation from its surrounding environment. From an examination of the deficiencies in such an approach and how to avoid them. an understanding of the concept of the environment is very imperative. Besides. while many variables are said to cause process and system delays in construction projects. most have been conceptualized to assess aspects of project delays. However. most of these variables for assessing project delays still need improvement. This paper presents the concept of project environment. and proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating delay sources in the external environment of construction projects through ‘PESTLE’Framework Analysis namely; Political. Economic. Social. Technological. Legal and Environmental. Following the synthesis and screening of the literature review and the identified main sources. it showed that the major external sources of delays are associated with the ‘PESTLE’factors. Thus. it is therefore established that ‘PESTLE’framework analysis. if well understood. could be an instrumental tool for project performance assessment studies and contributes to the knowledge and practice on delay control.,True,x8vSCxoAAAAJ:FPJr55Dyh1AC,30,https://ieomsociety.org/ieomdetroit/pdfs/254.pdf,9939045335218425640,/scholar?cites=9939045335218425640,,https://ieomsociety.org/ieomdetroit/pdfs/254.pdf,0,0,0

Eng,1,,,This article reviewed developments of Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) technology in rapid prototyping process. Rapid prototyping (RP) can be classified into three major groups; subtractive. additive and virtual. CNC rapid prototyping is grouped under the subtractive category which involves material removal from the workpiece that is larger than the final part. Richard Wysk established the use of CNC machines for rapid prototyping using sets of 2½-D tool paths from various orientations about a rotary axis to machine parts without refixturing. Since then. there are few developments on this process mainly aimed to optimized the operation and increase the process capabilities to stand equal with common additive type of RP. These developments include the integration between machining and deposition process (hybrid RP). adoption of RP to the conventional machine and optimization of the CNC rapid prototyping process based on controlled parameters. The article ended by concluding that the CNC rapid prototyping research area has a vast space for improvement as in the conventional machining processes.

Based on scientific evidence for the evolution of air pollution and the institutional background of environmental governance in China. we examine the development of air pollution control policies from the 1980s and onwards. We show that:(1) The early policies. until 2005. were ineffective at reducing emissions;(2) During 2006–2012. new instruments which interact with political incentives were introduced in the 11th Five-Year Plan. and the national goal of reducing total sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions by 10% was achieved. However. regional compound air pollution problems dominated by fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and ground level ozone (O 3) emerged and worsened;(3) After the winter-long PM 2.5 episode in eastern China in 2013. air pollution control policies have been experiencing significant changes on multiple fronts. In this work we analyze the different policy changes. the drivers of changes and key factors influencing the effectiveness of policies in these three stages. Lessons derived from the policy evolution have implications for future studies. as well as further reforming the management scheme towards air quality and health risk oriented directions.

1214236,Property prices and exposure to multiple noise sources: Hedonic regression with road and railway noise,2010,Henrik Andersson and Lina Jonsson and Mikael Ögren,45,Environmental and resource economics,1,73-89,Springer Netherlands,This study examines the effect of road and railway noise on property prices. It uses the hedonic regression technique on a Swedish data set that contains information about both road and railway noise for each property. and finds that road noise has a larger negative impact on the property prices than railway noise. This is in line with the evidence from the acoustical literature which has shown that individuals are more disturbed by road than railway noise. but contradicts recent results from a hedonic study on data of the United Kingdom.,True,FMPdWA0AAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC,156,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10640-009-9306-4.pdf,15526735991915873752,/scholar?cites=15526735991915873752,,http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/15522/1/medias/doc/by/andersson/property.pdf,0,0,0

The results from the study show that the market price of an automobile is negatively correlated with its inherent risk level. i.e. Swedish car consumers pay a safety premium for safer cars.

1214238,The value of a statistical life,2011,Henrik Andersson and Nicolas Treich,,,,,Edward Elgar Publishing,Modern societies rely on a well-functioning transportation infrastructure. Policies taken to maintain and/or improve an infrastructure come at a cost; and the scarcity of resources forces policy makers to prioritize between policies. The use of a common metric for benefits and costs may facilitate the evaluation of different policies. which in turn. enables policy makers to allocate resources more efficiently. Monetary values often act as this common metric. Another good reason for monetizing non-marketed goods is that this common ground for comparisons makes the prioritization process more transparent to those not directly involved in the process (for example. the public). Many of the benefits and costs induced by policies within the transport sector have monetary values. Material expenditures. for example. for road improvements in order to increase safety and reduce travel time. are easily obtainable since the materials …,True,FMPdWA0AAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,106,https://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781847202031/9781847202031.00025.xml,3538959905008071806,/scholar?cites=3538959905008071806,,https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:669387/FULLTEXT01.pdf,0,0,0

Using a sample of 8592 Swedish adolescents aged 15–18. this paper contributes to the literature by exploring gender differences in smoking risk perceptions and in the responses to the latter. The results show significant gender differences in the perception of smoking mortality risk and in the perception of the addictiveness of smoking.

Numerous empirical studies suggest that monetary values from SP studies are sensitive to survey design and so may not reflect respondents’ true preferences.

Previous research on the valuation of health risk has been dominated by the study of mortality risk. However. in most cases foodborne illnesses are non‐fatal. so we focus on individuals' preferences for reducing morbidity risk. while also including a realistic. if remote. chance of death. We use a contingent valuation method on a Swedish sample and we estimate a value of a statistical illness consistent with previous findings in the literature. We also examine how willingness to pay (WTP) varies with the expected change in quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs) and estimate the WTP per QALY.

1214252,Economic analysis and Investment priorities in Sweden’s transport sector,2018,Henrik Andersson and Lars Hultkrantz and Gunnar Lindberg and Jan-Eric Nilsson,9,,1,120-146,Walter de Gruyter. Inc,Beginning as a planning tool within Sweden’s national road administration some 50 years ago. benefit-cost analysis (BCA) has come to be a pillar of the national transport policy because of subsequent strategic choices made by the national parliament. These choices made it necessary to widen the analysis of costs to include also externalities and a foregone conclusion was that efficient investment priorities should be made based on BCA. But no one asked whether the political decision makers or the BCA models were up to that task. This paper reviews the institutional framework and practice of BCA in Sweden for transport infrastructure investment. and considers design issues that have been and still are debated. such as whether the discount rate should include a risk term and how to account for the marginal cost of public funds. A main concern with BCA results is the underestimation of construction costs. making transport sector projects look better than they are. Several ex post analyses have established that a higher NPV ratio increases the probability of being included in the investment program proposal prepared by the agency. The requirement to let projects undergo BCA seems to make planners “trim” project proposals by trying to reduce investment costs without significantly reducing benefits. This relationship is weaker among profitable projects. Moreover. there is no correlation between rate of return and the probability of being included in the final program. which is established on political grounds.,True,FMPdWA0AAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,21,http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/26015/,4894629688749943917,/scholar?cites=4894629688749943917,,http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/26015/1/sweden_transport.pdf,0,0,0

By harmonizing the economic and demographic trends as well as a carbon tax pathway. we explore how both models respond to these identical exogenous inputs. Then a soft-linking methodology is applied to “narrow the gap” between the results computed by these models. We find for example that without soft-linking. China’s baseline CO2 emissions might range from 15–20 Gt in 2050. while soft-linking models results in 17 Gt. Reasons for the results gap between the models are discussed subsequently. such as model structure and statistical inputs. At a sectoral level. the gap can be mainly traced to China’s future coal use in electricity …,True,9Jp7TgMAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,71,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261915008272,2992758653854634678,/scholar?cites=2992758653854634678,,,0,0,0

Trade improves efficiency through selection and share-shifting effects on firms. and thus–if more productive firms match with cleaner technologies–symmetric trade openness can improve overall environmental quality. Yet emission technologies. economic characteristics and trade barriers are highly asymmetric across countries. This can lead to some unexpected implications of national trade policies on total carbon emissions. We find that. even in an asymmetric setting. trade openness can help reducing global emissions. However different effects act together depending on the size. productivity and emission profile of the trading partners. We then resort to a simple parameterization of the model to show the effect of different forces.

We conduct a lab experiment in the field with South African coal miners from various ethnic groups and with different trade union membership status. Our analysis suggests that union identity and ethnic identity are two social constructs that operate in a distinct and opposite fashion. Unionization acts as a factor of workers solidarity beyond the confine of union membership. Conversely. ethnicity operates as the linchpin through which discrimination among workers is infused not only between ethnic majority and minorities. but also within the majority group itself.

North and South. the first with high environmental concerns and the second endowed with abundant fossil fuel resources. In this asymmetric setting. the South specializes in energy production using fossil fuels. causing local and global environmental damages. The North. instead. specializes in other manufacturing and imports energy inputs from the South. Endogenous innovation reinforces this pattern of specialization over time. We show that the North can unilaterally stop the use of fossil fuels and avoid a global climate disaster with two different strategies: either redirecting the comparative advantage of the South towards manufacturing. relocating the production of energy to the North. or buying fossil fuel deposits in the South. These two policies have different implications in terms of monetary costs and environmental outcomes for the North. The choice between the two depends on the valuation of the environment. the energy requirements of final goods’ production. the starting time of the policy and the time preferences of the North.

The Graduate Institute,This paper looks at the problem of information control behind the unsustainable levels of air pollution in China. In particular. it focuses on a large urban area. Beijing. and it examines the role of the public. government-controlled information and the adaptation choices of households in response to signals about high pollution. Our analysis is based on a simple theoretical framework in which people migrate from rural areas to polluted cities. receiving a signal from the government about urban pollution; hence. they decide whether to adapt to pollution or not. We find that the government has no incentive to ensure sustainable air quality. as it can distort pollution information in order to attract cheap labour. We then analyse empirically two different air pollution indexes from different sources and agents’ behaviour in an original household survey collected in Beijing. We find that the official air pollution values are systematically distorted. creating perverse incentives for households to react to bad air quality. especially for people who rely on government-controlled sources of information.,True,V6wEQ5YAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://repository.graduateinstitute.ch/record/286976/files/CIES_RP_27Swanson.pdf;,,,,https://repository.graduateinstitute.ch/record/286976/files/CIES_RP_27Swanson.pdf;,0,0,0

Centre for International Environmental Studies,This paper examines how a government that controls both public information and pollution emissions can exercise discretion in its choice of pollution signals. and thus influence pollution responses in the population. We develop a model of the government's optimal decision about pollution emissions and information about them. and we apply its results in the context of the information distortions and the adaptation choices of households in Beijing. China. We proceed in three stages. First. we use a simple signal extraction model to motivate why a government may choose to distort information about pollution. Then. we perform a time series analysis on air pollution announcements. to test empirically if the information signal in Beijing is biased when compared to an alternative measure from the US Embassy. This analysis indicates that public information is systematically modified. as predicted by our model. Finally. using data from an original household survey. we examine the effect of the distorted public signal on agents' behavior. and find that those who rely on public media controlled by the government are significantly less responsive to pollution peaks. demonstrating the impact of governmental control over information.,True,V6wEQ5YAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,0,https://repository.graduateinstitute.ch/record/297083/usage,,,,,0,0,0

The Graduate Institute,We examine the link between international aid. political instability and economic growth in autocratic countries. First. we discuss the manner in which externally provided liquidity can affect looting and instability in an autocratic country. through the generation of outside options for a dictator who has property rights over the resource wealth of the country. We then use a treatment-effects approach to analyze empirically the role of natural resource wealth and aid on instability and. in turn. on growth. We find that the interaction of natural resources with most forms of international aid results in increased political instability and reduced growth. Interestingly. some forms of government aid (principally humanitarian aid) do not have this effect. We explore the reasons behind the interaction between resources and specific flows of aid. and find that both flows of aid and the structure of those flows depend upon the presence of resource wealth. Specifically. we find that aid flows toward poor countries (in terms of resources. income and indebtedness). but that aid structured as loans is more likely to flow toward resource-rich countries. We conclude that aid can generally have the effect of inducing instability in resource-rich autocratic countries. and that this instability is the instrument through which growth is reduced.,True,V6wEQ5YAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,0,http://repec.graduateinstitute.ch/pdfs/ciesrp/CIES_RP_15.pdf,,,,http://repec.graduateinstitute.ch/pdfs/ciesrp/CIES_RP_15.pdf,0,0,0

It examines foreign currency exposure. currency usage and the discrepancy between trade-weighted and  nancially-weighted eff ective exchange rates (EERs gap). Looking at the speci c eff ect of the Euro through interaction dummies. I  find that countries are highly sensitive in their choice both of exposure and of currency usage to several national and international factors. The strongest results are those for the determinants of currency shares. which con rfim the predictions of optimal portfolio choice models. and those for the volatility of the EERs gap.

Trade improves efficiency through selection and share shifting effects on firms. and thus ʹ if more productive firms match with cleaner technologies ʹ symmetric trade openness can improve overall environmental quality. Yet emission technologies. economic characteristics and trade barriers are highly asymmetric across countries. This can lead to some unexpected implications of national trade policies on total carbon emissions. We find that. even in an asymmetric setting. trade openness can help reducing global emissions. However different effects act together depending on the size. productivity and emission profile of the trading partners. We then resort to a simple parameterization of the model to show the effect of different forces.

This study evaluates the ozone pollution-related health impacts on China's national and provincial economy and compares them with the impacts from PM2.5. We also explore the mitigation potential across 30 provinces of China. An integrated approach is developed that combines an air pollutant emission projection model (GAINS). an air quality model (GEOS-Chem). a health model using the latest exposure-response functions. medical prices and value of statistical life (VSL). and a general equilibrium model (CGE). Results show that lower income western provinces encounter severer health impacts and economic burdens due to high natural background levels of ozone pollution. whereas the impact in southern and central provinces is relatively lower. Without a control policy. in 2030 China will experience a 4.24 billion USD Gross Domestic Production (GDP) loss (equivalent to 0.034 %). and a 285 billion USD (equivalent to 2.34 % of GDP) life loss. In contrast. with a control policy. the GDP and VSLs loss will be reduced to 3.72 (0.030 %) and 242 billion USD (1.99 %). respectively. We conclude that health and economic impacts of ozone pollution are significantly lower than PM2.5. but are much more difficult to mitigate.

1214346,The willingness to pay for property rights for the giant panda: can a charismatic species be an instrument for nature conservation?,2003,Andreas Kontoleon and Timothy Swanson,79,Land economics,4,483-499,University of Wisconsin Press,This paper presents the results from a contingent valuation (CV) that elicited willingness to pay (WTP) of OECD citizens. for the conservation of the Giant Panda. The study investigates the extent to which such a charismatic or flagship species can be used to promote wider biodiversity conservation. There exists an internally consistent WTP for the purchase of property rights of the habitat required for the conservation of the panda. This WTP is shown to consist largely of the value placed on the “naturalness” of the species. implying that the symbolic nature of the panda might be a potential instrument for greater biodiversity conservation.

1214348,The economics and ecology of biodiversity decline: the forces driving global change,1998,Timothy M Swanson,,,,,Cambridge University Press,The cause of global change has been the subject of heated debate in the past few years. especially in relation to climate change and biodiversity decline. However. a systematic explanation for changes in the biosphere at the global level has still not been found. In this volume. a wide range of viewpoints from ecology and economics are surveyed to see if some light can be shed on this problem. Economists analyze how economic growth predictably alters the earth. and ecologists consider how the drive for fitness and consequent population growth changes the globe. Both look at the institutional interface between humans and biosphere. and explain global change as the consequence of human noncooperation and conflict. The object of this volume is to initiate debate among economists. ecologists and conservationists on global change at this most fundamental level.,True,gTuTubMAAAAJ:BwyfMAYsbu0C,143,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8zSavItcId8C&oi=fnd&pg=PR9&dq=info:jxNXHW2qoKMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Qt9IzSfDcG&sig=g0SOQqj3B5vRBjhlFKb9rb-r3Ww,11790611210076361615,/scholar?cites=11790611210076361615,,,0,0,0

We evaluate the ability of the Sloping Lands Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China. a reforestation payments programme. to relax constraints on off-farm labour markets and achieve these dual objectives. Our model of the agricultural household allows for heterogeneous exposure to constraints and impacts. The model predicts that the impact of the SLCP on off-farm labour supply will be larger for constrained households if constraints are relaxed. To test the predictions we combine a switching regression with difference in differences.

Given the existence of transaction costs within an industry. the location of a property rights assignment is a crucial factor determining the incentives for efficient levels of investment at various levels of that industry. In the context of plant genetic resources. this means that property rights that are located at the retail end of the pharmaceutical and plant breeding industries may not have sufficient effect to generate the incentives to supply adequate amounts of plant genetic resources to the research and development sectors at the base of these industries.,True,gTuTubMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,116,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999000725,37044864791818364,/scholar?cites=37044864791818364,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.319.1123&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

1214358,Global action for biodiversity: an international framework for implementing the convention on biological diversity,2013,Timothy Swanson,,,,,Routledge,At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. the nations of the world adopted the convention on Biological Diversity. Since then. over 160 countries have ratified the Convention. three Conferences of the Parties have taken place and a permanent secretariat has been established. Despite this. there remains a lot of uncertainty and even more controversy about what the Convention was intended to accomplish and how it was to do so. This book. published in association with the IUCN-The World Conservation Union. sets out to answer some of these questions by recounting the history of the movements leading up to the Convention. but especially by analysing the forces giving rise to the problem. It provides a specific set of policy prescriptions intended to facilitate the development of institutions and obligations within the international community which will give real effect to the aspirations of the Convention. and the ensure that it has some real effect at ground level. The author begins with an overview of the issues and then develops the basic nature of the problems within a bio-economic framework. He highlights the gaps in the Convention which remain to be filled. offers detailed explanations of the concepts involved and describes the nature of the solutions required. Thus he sets out a detailed plan for global action in support of an effective international convention for the conservation of biological diversity.

Biodiversity should be seen as an important source of a stock of information on which these research and development processes are built. This stock of information is of the nature of an economic asset that depreciates as the environment creates new problems. creating the need for a continual and perpetual supply of new information. Results are reported from a survey of the agricultural research and development industry. demonstrating how the environment engenders new problems in a systematic fashion and how the industry makes recourse to biological diversity for stocks of information to address those problems.

Most of the resources whose regulation is implicit in the CBD are in fact domestic terrestrial species. everything from elephants to medicinal plants. The rationale for international intervention in the sphere of national land use planning lies in the recurring themes of underprovided diversity: underfunded. underappreciated. undermanaged species. In many different areas of international affairs—ranging from the trade in endangered species to the management of agricultural gene banks—these same problems arise. How is it possible to induce countries hosting diverse biological resources to expend the resources necessary to maintain them?

The R&D process is onein which firms are engaging in a continuing contest of innovation againsta background of both creative destruction (Schumpeterian competition) andadaptive destruction (natural selection and adaptation).

Based on the universe of credit and debit card transactions in China from 2013 to 2015. this paper provides to our knowledge the first analysis of the morbidity cost of PM2. 5 for the entire population of a developing country. To address potential endogeneity in pollution exposure. we construct an instrumental variable by modeling the spatial spillovers of PM2. 5 due to long-range transport. We propose a flexible distributed-lag model that incorporates the IV approach to capture the dynamic response to past pollution exposure. Our analysis shows that PM2. 5 has a significant impact on healthcare spending in both the short and medium terms that survives an array of robustness checks. The annual reduction in national healthcare spending from complying with the World Health Organization’s annual standard of 10 mg/m3 would amount to $42 billion. or nearly 7% of China’s total healthcare spending in 2015.

This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture. but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity.

We examine formally how exogenous shocks. such as changes in international energy prices. interact with positive reinforcement factors. such as the growing strength of the renewables advocacy coalition. We find that political competition modifies the effect of path dependence on policy and outcomes. Specifically. while “green” governments can use positive reinforcement mechanisms to lock in policy commitments (by creating green constituencies). “brown” governments strategically underprovide public support for renewable energy (to avoid creating green constituencies). The effect of positive reinforcement also decreases with international energy prices.

Sometimes international bureaucrats possess limited discretion in institutional design; sometimes. they enjoy broad discretion.

This contravenes conventional thinking about delegation: discretion should decrease as preference divergence between states and international bureaucrats increases.

Studying the results from a survey of 8.568 households in six large. energy-poor states from northern. central and eastern India. we find that household satisfaction responds strongly to the average hours of electricity available on a typical day. The positive effect of increasing the number of hours per day by one standard deviation on satisfaction is almost as large as that of electrifying a non-electrified household.

Under these conditions. when do states prefer to integrate regimes instead of keeping them separated? We develop a strategic theory of regime integration and separation. The theory highlights the nature of spillovers between issues. Positive spillovers exist when cooperation in one issue area aids the pursuit of objectives in another issue area; negative spillovers exist when cooperation in one issue area impedes this pursuit in another issue area. Conventional wisdom suggests that both positive and negative spillovers foster greater integration. We argue that negative spillovers encourage integration while positive spillovers do not. States integrate not to exploit positive spillovers between issues but to mitigate negative spillovers.

We illuminate the relationship between international institutions and domestic politics by analyzing whether preferential trading agreements (PTAs) promote liberal economic reform. In developing countries. leaders engage in PTA negotiations with major powers (European Union and United States) when these leaders want to implement reforms but cannot do so due to domestic political opposition and a lack of credible commitment.

Given the high socio-economic cost of this policy failure. both scholars and policymakers have recently become interested in off-grid electrification programs. However. the relationship between national grid expansion and off-grid electrification remains unclear. Are these two approaches independent of each other. or perhaps even competitors? This article develops a taxonomy that allows grid expansion and off-grid electrification to complement each other.

There are three principal findings: (i) fuel costs are a critical obstacle to widespread adoption. (ii) fuel stacking is the prevailing norm as few households stop using firewood when adopting LPG. and (iii) both users and non-users have highly positive views of LPG as a convenient and clean cooking fuel.

1214414,Unilateral influence on international bureaucrats: an international delegation problem,2012,Johannes Urpelainen,56,Journal of Conflict Resolution,4,704-735,SAGE Publications,The conventional wisdom emphasizes agency slack or bias as the central problem of international delegation. I show that the possibility of a unilateral influence contest is equally problematic. States can exert unilateral influence on autonomous international bureaucrats. either through rewards or through punishments. to pursue their particular interests. A costly contest results. so some states could refuse to delegate because they expect others to be too influential. The analysis has four counterintuitive empirical implications.

Compressive strength values are found to be higher than the tensile strength values at all volume fractions of the phases.

With the use of wall-mounted water-type PV/T collectors. the system not only generates electricity and hot water simultaneously. but also improves the thermal insulation of the building envelope. A numerical model of this hybrid system was developed by modifying the Hottel–Whillier model. which was originally for the thermal analysis of flat-plate solar thermal collectors. Computer simulation was performed to analyze the system performance. The combined effects of the solar cell packing factor and the water mass flow rate on the thermal and electrical efficiencies were investigated.

Many studies have been done regarding the effect on the mean of such distributions but few have addressed the effect on variance. Furthermore. those that have been done generally report the variance from crop simulators. not from observations.

In particular. maximum likelihood panel data estimates of the impacts of climate on year-to-year yield variability are constructed for the major U.S. agricultural crops.

Commonly. such analyses are based on probability distributions arising from historical data where the distributions developed are based on at least a partial assumption of stationarity. For example. in water-based risk analysis one typically assumes the distribution is stationary. and uses the 100 year drought. In yield-related analyses analysts typically assume the mean is changing with time (proxying for technological progress along with monetary inflation) but that the variance is stationary. Climate change may alter distribution stationarity (as asserted in a water setting by Milly et al. 2008).

NAFO subdivision 3Ps,1999,Y Chen and LGS Mello,42,Fisheries Research,1-2,87-101,Elsevier,Using data collected in fishery-independent bottom-trawl surveys of cod in NAFO subdivision 3Ps. we examine (1) the variations in growth and maturation of cod among year classes from 1969 to 1990 and (2) inter-relationships between growth and maturation of cod. To reduce impacts of outliers on data analyses. a robust maximum likelihood estimator is used to fit the von Bertalanffy growth function to size-at-age data. An overall indicator for pre-maturity growth of cod is developed using a robust principal component analysis. This study suggests that cod born during 1980s have smaller length-at-age values when compared with cod born in 1970s. The age at maturity declined steadily from the highest of 7 yr old for the 1981 year-class to 5 yr old for the 1990 year-class. Growth and maturation were significantly related to each other.

1214500,A Monte Carlo study on impacts of the size of subsample catch on estimation of fish stock parameters,1996,Y Chen,26,Fisheries Research,3-4,207-223,Elsevier,Most models currently used in studying dynamics of fish stocks are age-structured stock assessment models. One of the essential input data requirements for this type of model is estimates of age composition by year. In practice. age composition is seldom estimated by aging all fish harvested; rather it is estimated from aging a small group of fishes (i.e. subsample catch) randomly subsampled from the total catch. Although many studies have noted errors in aging fish from the subsample catch with respect to the estimation of fish stock parameters. errors in estimating age composition resulting from this random subsampling has received little attention. Using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. this study evaluated the impacts of different sizes of subsample catch on estimating fish mortality rates. cohort sizes at recruitment. and age-specific selectivity coefficients with two cohort-based models.

1214501,Can a more realistic model error structure improve the parameter estimation in modelling the dynamics of fish populations?,1998,Y Chen and JE Paloheimo,38,Fisheries Research,1,9-17,Elsevier,Mathematical models are commonly used to describe the dynamics of fish populations. These models are fitted to observed fisheries data by estimating parameters with assumptions made concerning model error structure. Large errors are commonly associated with fisheries data which can result from many sources. However. such errors are often assumed non-existent for some observed variables when fitting models to data. This may result from our effort of simplifying the model error structure to facilitate the use of the classical least squares method in the parameter estimation. The impacts of ignoring certain errors in some or all variables on the parameter estimation are rarely evaluated in modelling the dynamics of fish populations. Using a simple cohort-based model as an example in this study. we examine the impacts of the lack of a realistic model error structure on the parameter estimation.

1214507,Assessing discarding at sea using a length-structured yield-per-recruit model,1997,Y Chen and GNG Gordon,30,Fisheries Research,1-2,43-55,Elsevier,Discarding at sea is a common practice in fisheries. Part of the catch is often discarded because fish are too small to be marketed. or are bycatch. Regulations such as trip limits or quota limitations also provide fishermen with a strong incentive to discard fish that are above their quota and to high grade to maximize profits. Almost all fish discarded at sea die. However. the impacts of discarding at sea have not been evaluated in many fisheries. Because the probability of a fish being discarded is usually dependent upon its length. a length-structured model is appropriate for evaluating discarding. In this study. we propose an approach to evaluating the impacts of discarding at sea using a length-structured yield-per-recruit model.

Several yeast strains have shown the ability to effectively degrade patulin. However. the mechanisms of its biodegradation still remain unclear at this time. In the present study. biodegradation and involved mechanisms of patulin by an antagonistic yeast Candida guilliermondii were investigated. The results indicated that C. guilliermondii was capable of not only multiplying to a high population in medium containing patulin. but also effectively reducing patulin content in culture medium. Degradation of patulin by C. guilliermondii was dependent on the yeast cell viability. and mainly occurred inside cells. E-ascladiol was the main degradation product of patulin. An iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis revealed that the responses of C. guilliermondii to patulin were complex. A total of 30 differential proteins involved in 10 biological processes were identified. and more than two-thirds of the differential proteins were down-accumulated. Notably. a short-chain dehydrogenase (gi| 190348612) was markedly induced by patulin at both the protein and mRNA levels. Our findings will provide a foundation to help enable the commercial development of an enzyme formulation for the detoxification of patulin in fruit-derived products.

Inc.,The patulin biosynthesis is one of model pathways in an understanding of secondary metabolite biology and network novelties in fungi. However. molecular regulation mechanism of patulin biosynthesis and contribution of each gene related to the different catalytic enzymes in the biochemical steps of the pathway remain largely unknown in fungi. In this study. the genetic components of patulin biosynthetic pathway were systematically dissected in Penicillium expansum. which is an important fungal pathogen and patulin producer in harvested fruits and vegetables. Our results revealed that all the 15 genes in the cluster are involved in patulin biosynthesis. Proteins encoded by those genes are compartmentalized in various subcellular locations. including cytosol. nucleus. vacuole. endoplasmic reticulum. plasma membrane and cell wall.

Algae constitute a unique feedstock as they contain high levels of both lipids and sugars and. thus. can be used for both biodiesel and ethanol production successively. in a two-stage process. In addition. the production of algae-based fuels shows a low environmental footprint and high energy efficiency. Algae can produce between 10 and 100 times more oil per acre as compared with traditional oil crops (e.g.. oil palm) and can also grow 20–30 times faster than food crops.

1214529,Socio-economic implications of drought in the agricultural sector and the state economy,2016,Jadwiga R Ziolkowska,4,Economies,3,19,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In 2011. the most severe drought in Texas history caused $7.62 billion in losses in the agricultural sector alone. This paper analyzes ripple effects of the 2011 drought in Texas agriculture on the entire state economy retrospectively in an effort to foster discussion on targeted mitigation measures in the long term. By using an Input-Output and social accounting matrix model. direct effects on livestock. cotton. sorghum. wheat. corn. hay. and timber production. as well as indirect effects on other related sectors. and finally induced effects from changing consumers behavior have been estimated. According to the results. the 2011 drought caused economic losses of $16.9 billion in the entire Texas economy and increased the unemployment by around 166.895 people. The agricultural sector alone lost around 106.000 jobs. The cotton farming experienced 91% of revenue losses (as compared to 2010). while the livestock production lost 32% in revenue. The decreased production yields and limited market supply directly influence market prices for those products. which might create additional spillover effects on export and import quantities. The presented analysis can be helpful for designing policies to launch mitigation programs for drought events in the future.

These sections of the paper state the basic issues under each theme. outline the latest literature on the subtopics. discuss the main issues that are important for this region. and suggest how FAO and member countries can address these issues through policy and institutional actions and reforms. Public goods provision is a cross-cutting issue. Although the scope of this paper covers all of the region. there will be considerably more emphasis on the transition countries of the region. including the EU-12. and less on the EU-15 or old member states (OMS) of the EU. It is well understood that the Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia regions encompass a great deal of diversity. All countries have been through a transition of institutions and governance during the last twenty years but the initial conditions. transition policies and the pace and direction of reforms and restructuring varied greatly as did the consequences for the social and economic well-being of the populations and the business environment. To highlight some of these differences and anticipate some of the implications for policy responses. this large and diverse group of countries is divided into three subgroups: the European Union New Member States (NMS). Other European (OEUR). and Southern Caucasus/Central Asia (SCCA). As is clear from data. there is still much diversity within each group. so any generalizations about these sub-regions are likely to be misleading (Table 1).(Kosovo. which …,True,8Emon9QAAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC,10,http://www.fao.org/3/a-aq343e.pdf,9878626455699975099,/scholar?cites=9878626455699975099,,http://www.fao.org/3/a-aq343e.pdf,0,0,0

Most of these studies address biofuels in terms of such questions as: price stability on national and international markets 1) 2). support policies3) 4). welfare economics. growth and poverty. and food security 5). While most research is focused on market and price implications. little research has been done on environmental effects of biofuels. Dicks et al. 6) set forth implications of growing ethanol demand for land use changes while Lankoski and Ollikainen 7) examined the multiple environmental effects of policies promoting biofuel production from agricultural crops. Referring to this existing gap. we seek to extend the discussion on environmental effects of biofuels and introduce a theoretical framework as well as an empirical analysis on positive and negative implications of biofuels consumption and production.

1214544,Groundwater level changes due to extreme weather—an evaluation tool for sustainable water management,2017,Jadwiga R Ziolkowska and Reuben Reyes,9,Water,2,117,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,In the past decade. extreme and exceptional droughts have significantly impacted many economic sectors in the US. especially in California. Oklahoma. and Texas. The record drought of 2011–2014 affected almost 90% of Texas areas and 95% of Oklahoma state areas. In 2011 alone. around $1.6 billion in agricultural production were lost as a result of drought in Oklahoma. and $7.6 billion in Texas. The agricultural sectors in Oklahoma and Texas rely mainly on groundwater resources from the non-replenishable Ogallala Aquifer in Panhandle and other aquifers around the states. The exceptional droughts of 2011–2014 not only caused meteorologically induced water scarcity (due to low precipitation). but also prompted farmers to overuse groundwater to maintain the imperiled production. Comprehensive studies on groundwater levels. and thus the actual water availability/scarcity across all aquifers in Oklahoma and Texas are still limited. Existing studies are mainly focused on a small number of selected sites or aquifers over a short time span of well monitoring. which does not allow for a holistic geospatial and temporal evaluation of groundwater level variations. This paper aims at addressing those issues with the proposed geospatial groundwater visualization model to assess availability of groundwater resources for agricultural. industrial. and municipal uses both in Oklahoma and Texas in the time frame of 2003–2014. The model is an evaluation tool that can be used by decision-makers for designing sustainable water management practices and by teachers and researchers for educational purposes.

1214568,Optimization of well placement and control to maximize CO2 trapping during geologic sequestration,2016,Jerzy Stopa and Damian Janiga and Paweł Wojnarowski and Robert Czarnota,33,"AGH Drilling, Oil, Gas",1,,,One of the most promising solution for CCS (carbon capture and storage) is to inject supercritical carbon dioxide into underground saline aquifers due to the large storage capacity [1]. A major concern with CCS in aquifers is the potential for leakage and gas migration outside the trapping zone in the aquifer. Leakage could occur due to loss of integrity of formation cap rock caused by overpressurization of the formation. The consequences of leakage and gas zone spreading in aquifer may include groundwater contamination. ecosystem damage and emission CO2 into the atmosphere. CCS management should include optimization of injection process. It is preferable that gas should be not trapped only structurally but via other mechanisms. The sequestration process can be separate into two steps. The first step is the operation period when gas is injected into aquifer. It can take up from 10–100 years depending on the size of project. During this phase CO2 displaces the brine in pore space. A portion of injected gas dissolves into brine. but most of injected gas remains in separate phase. In second step there is no more CO2 injection. The difference of densities between brine and CO2 causes the gas migration upwards to the top of geological structure. The cap rock stops the further upward movement–this phenomenon is called structural trapping [2]. This trapping mechanism is not preferable during long term CCS because the CO2 is still mobile and loss of integrity may cause it to leak from the formation. There is another trapping mechanism which,True,o7hRkn4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,2,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-7844e0d9-e22f-4c4f-8a01-930db0c4583d,379416240371095191,/scholar?cites=379416240371095191,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-7844e0d9-e22f-4c4f-8a01-930db0c4583d/c/drill.2016.33.1.93.pdf,0,0,0

The combination of the advanced oil production method involving the injection of carbon dioxide into the reservoir (CO 2-EOR) with its geological sequestration (CCS) is the CCS-EOR process. To achieve the best ecological effect. it is important to maximize the storage capacity for CO 2 injected in the CCS phase. To achieve this state. it is necessary to maximize recovery factor of the reservoir during the CO 2-EOR phase. For this purpose. it is important to choose the best location of CO 2 injection wells. In this work. a new algorithm to optimize the location of carbon dioxide injection wells is developed. It is based on two key reservoir properties. ie. porosity and permeability. The developed optimization procedure was tested on an exemplary oil field simulation model. The obtained results were compared with the option of arbitrary selection of injection well locations. which confirmed both the legitimacy of using well location optimization and the effectiveness of the developed optimization method.

The article also presents the social and wealthy position of Old-Russia women during the studied period of time. The research sources used in the article are Old-Russian chronicles: The Russian Primary Chronicle and Letopisets Pereyaslavlya-Suzdal’skogo. Analysis of the Old-Russian chronicles allowed the separation of two fundamentally different ways of entering into marriage in the pre-Christian period:“kidnappings”(“umychka”) and “conduct”(“vedeniye”) of wife. In addition. it is possible to reconstruct the third intermediate form of marriage—purchase of the bride (“kuplya-prodazha”).

1214586,Russian oil and gas industry on the eve of changes,2017,Katarzyna Kosowska and Piotr Kosowski,34,"AGH Drilling, Oil, Gas",1,,,In 2016 Russia’s oil and gas industry celebrated 150th anniversary of its creation. 150 years before. in February 1866. in the valley of Kudako river in Kuban Oblast first oil in Russia flew. It was a breakthrough moment in the history of Russian economy’s development due to two main rea-sons: firstly. it was a strong impulse to develop the national oil industry. secondly. a proof of huge technological potential of Russia. Today. when oil industry is at its best technological revolution. Russian oil industry loses to its competitors. Current situation of Russian oil sector derives from the lack of any reforms for two decades when based on the Soviet Union’s legacy. Most of production still comes from old soviet-era fields and this wealth is running out [27]. Therefore. mentioned anniversary is a good moment to consider contemporary Russia’s oil industry. problems to be faced and prospects to its development. It is hard to imagine Russia’s economy without its accelerator–oil industry. Income from export of raw materials (mainly crude oil) has been a crucial part of federal budget of Russia-around 50% and allows subsidizing other branches of economy. Rising oil prices after 2000 made oil sector on one hand to become Russian’s economy accelerator. but on the other hand–new risks appeared deriving from its raw material orientation and excessive sensitivity to changing oil prices. Year by year dependence of the national economy on the oil industry has been increasing and considering its diversification is less important than one outstanding fact: oil and gas will remain the fundaments of Russia’s budget.,True,KqgAp60AAAAJ:KlAtU1dfN6UC,0,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-7322e41b-c305-47b6-851c-9c0195fb4a3b,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-7322e41b-c305-47b6-851c-9c0195fb4a3b/c/kosowska_drilling_1_2017.pdf,0,0,0
1214587,The geopolitics of Gazprom’s pipelines,2016,Katarzyna Kosowska and Piotr Kosowski,33,"AGH Drilling, Oil, Gas",4,,,The natural gas market over the years has been strongly dependent on pipeline transport and based on it a gas market was created and functioned. It was connected with the properties of the fuel. including. inter alia. compressibility and relatively low energy per unit volume. It caused that transport using other methods was ineffective in terms of technical aspects and not very profitable. For this reason. unlikely to the oil market. the global gas market was not created and did not function. but only national. regional and continental markets separated from the others functioned. The situation began to change in recent years due to the fast technological development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) technology and the rise of the global natural gas market seems now unavoidable. Currently though. markets still operate mainly based on transmission pipelines. The consequence of this situation is the fact that the key importers of Russian gas abroad are the CIS countries and European countries. The Russian transmission infrastructure was built in the Soviet times to deliver gas to key industrial centres of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries of Eastern Europe. In the 70’s and 80’s of the XXth century two first main lines for transferring Russian gas to Western Europe were opened.

В середине XV века в Пскове выяснялось. сколько раз должен произноситься при богослужении возглас „аллилуйя”–два или три. Параллельно в Москве начался спор. в которую сторону процессия должна обходить церковь. В Руси закрепился обычай обходить „по солнцу”. противоречащий практике восточных патриархов1. Очередной проблемой явился вопрос. как креститься. Двуперстие. практикованное когда-то на православном Востоке. в XIII веке сменилось трехперстным крестом. Изоляция Руси в период монгольского ига способствовала сохранению двуперстия. Стоглавый собор (1551) утвердил двуперстный крест и двойное „аллилуйя”. бросая анафему на верующих. прощающихся тремя пальцами и поющих втрое „аллилуйя”. Одновременно собор решил ввести поправки в старых литургических текстах. опираясь на „хорошие переводы”. Здесь стоит заметить. что в традиционной московской религиозности литургические обряды приобретали ценности равноправные с догматами. отсюда ни одна деталь не могла подвергнуться изменению или быть упущенной. Меньшее изменение в ритуале преобразовывалось нередко в первостепенный вопрос. вызывая бесконечные споры. Итак. четверть столетия раньше Максим Грек судился собором за ересь. состоящую в ошибочных поправках грамматического характера в тексте одной из литургических книг. а также другие мнимые преступления.

Podstawowym podatkiem przy prowadzeniu działalności opartej na eksploatacji złóż jest podatek od wydobycia surowców mineralnych–NDPI. Dwunastoletnia praktyka stosowania NDPI pokazała. że obowiązujący system podatkowy nie jest w stanie sprostać bieżącym problemom sektora naftowego. Jest on nastawiony na konfiskatę bieżących przychodów. wygenerowanych dzięki sprzyjającej koniunkturze cenowej na rynkach światowych. Skala NDPI przez długi czas pozostawała płaska i nie uwzględniała unikalności parametrów poszczególnych złóż. a także stopnia ich wyeksploatowania. Dlatego system podatkowy obwarowano licznymi ulgami. mającymi na celu stymulowanie wydobycia z nowych złóż oraz tych o dużym stopniu wyeksploatowania. Pomimo wprowadzonych ulg. system podatkowy jest uzasadniony wyłącznie w odniesieniu do projektów. które nie wiążą się z poważnymi nakładami inwestycyjnymi. Lecz nie sprawdza się on przy realizacji kapitałochłonnych projektów w nowych regionach wydobywczych oraz na szelfach mórz północnych. Sytuacji w branży naftowej nie poprawi obowiązujący obecnie „manewr podatkowy” polegający na stopniowym obniżaniu ceł eksportowych i akcyzy kosztem podnoszenia podatku NDPI. Zainicjowane zmiany pozwolą na zwiększenie wpływów budżetowych z tytułu NDPI. lecz jednocześnie wpłyną na obniżenie dochodów podmiotów działających w sektorze. w szczególności tych firm. które mają duży udział w wydobyciu i przetwórstwie ropy.

In the case of the coalbed methane formations two-phase flow. which is caused mainly by hydraulic fracturing process occurs. Discussed production system is more complicated than single-phase flow and finding the relationship between produced gas and produced water is required.In this paper. we propose a novel mathematical model for two-phase flow phenomena in CBM reservoirs.

An option for accomplishing that aim is the CO2 capture. utilization and storage technology (CCUS). It involves capturing CO2 from flue gas. transporting it. utilizing it for economically productive activities (CCU–carbon capture and utilization). and/or permanently disposing it in nonatmospheric sinks (CCS carbon capture and storage). Some technologies. such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) allow simultaneous CCUS [7]. because CO2 is a well-recognized asset in the petroleum industry for the enhancement of oil extraction. Its use for enhanced oil recovery is a process that seeks to improve the flow and recovery rate of hydrocarbon from a reservoir (CO2-EOR)[5]. Unlike other options for CO2 utilization (eg use as a chemical feedstock). EOR can provide long-term storage and is able to increase the production of an economically valuable resource [6]. CO2-EOR is expected to produce additional 5–20% of the original oil in place (OOIP)[4] and it is also identified to have a strong potential to reduce the overall CCS cost. however the cost benefits are strongly dependent on the oil price and the considered EOR injection period [2]. CO2-EOR is usually a large-scale project and requires techno-economic evaluation before its deployment. a particularly important issue in this assessment is the availability of a low-cost source of CO2. The issue of selection of sources of CO2 for projects CCS-CO2-EOR is raised in a number of references [1–2. 4–7].

In this paper we propose a new approach of estimating change/impact analysis by classifying change based on type of change classification eg (a) nature and (b) extent of change propagation. The impact set produced consists of two dimensions of information:(a) statements affected by change propagation and (b) percentage ie statements affected in each category and involving the overall system. We also propose an algorithm for classifying the type of change. To establish confidence in effectiveness and efficiency we illustrate this technique with the help of an example. Results of our analysis are promising towards achieving the aim of the proposed endeavor to enhance change classification. The proposed dynamic technique for estimating impact sets and their percentage of impact will help software maintainers in performing selective regression testing by analyzing impact sets regarding the nature of change and change dependency.,True,Xu23AYYAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,29,http://jips-k.org/journals/jips/digital-library/manuscript/file/22467/JIPS-2010-6-4-597.pdf,9172621666629269270,/scholar?cites=9172621666629269270,,http://jips-k.org/journals/jips/digital-library/manuscript/file/22467/JIPS-2010-6-4-597.pdf,0,0,0

1214690,A review paper on friction stir welding process,2020,Rudra Pratap Singh and Somil Dubey and Aman Singh and Subodh Kumar,,,,,Elsevier,Friction stir welding is a solid state joining process that welds two or more similar or dissimilar materials having different melting points through a blend of heat created by friction and mechanical mixing of the materials in the locale of the joint. Different alloys having elements like aluminium. magnesium etc and hard materials like steels are generally welded by this method. These materials being light in weight are frequently used in transport and other such industries. where light weight materials having good mechanical properties are preferred. If the joining of these materials is done by any fusion welding techniques. the mechanical properties of the welds are reduced. In friction stir welding the mechanical properties of the materials to be joined are not reduced as welding takes place due to only the forging effect and no melting of materials takes place.

1214734,GeoGebra as an instructional tool to promote students’ operational and structural conception of function,2010,I Bayazit and Yılmaz Aksoy and O Ilhan,,First North American GeoGebra Conference,,117-122,,The contemporary literature acknowledges two sorts of conceptions associated with the function concept: operational conception of function and structural conception of function. The former entails interpreting a function as a dynamic process transforming every input to an output. The latter is attained through constant reflection upon a function process which eventually leads to encapsulation or reification of that process into a unified entity. Structural conception enables one to use a function in further processes as if it was a single object. such as using a function in the processes of derivatives and integrals. It is in this respect students need to possess a structural conception of function so that they could succeed in learning advanced calculus topics including limits. derivatives and integrals.

However. in many cases of developing symbolic solutions for the nonlinear equations. recourse is made to approximate analytical methods in which their accuracies largely depend on the number of terms included in the solutions. In this work. analytical solutions are presented using differential transformation method with after-treatment technique for nonlinear analysis of vibration and flow-induced vibration of fluid-conveying carbon nanotube resting on Winkler and Pasternak foundations. The developed analytical solutions are used to investigate the effects of nonlocal parameter. Knudsen number. temperature. foundation parameters and boundary conditions on the dynamic behaviour of the single-walled nanotube. Also. the developed analytical solutions are verified with the numerical solutions and validated with experimental results.

For this purpose. WS 2 quantum dots (WS 2 QDs) were synthesized via a solvothermal method. which improved the mimetic behavior. The resulting WS 2 QDs with a size of 1–1.5 nm had a high fluorescence emission. dependent on the excitation wavelength. WS 2 QDs with uniform morphology showed a high catalytic effect in destroying H 2 O 2. The peroxidase-like activity of synthesized nanostructures was studied in H 2 O 2 chemical and electrochemical reduction systems. The mimetic effect of WS 2 QDs was also shown in an H 2 O 2–rhodamine B (RB) chemiluminescence system. For this aim. a stopped-flow chemiluminescence (CL) detection system was applied. Also. in order to confirm the peroxidase-like effect of quantum dots. colorimetry and electrochemical techniques were used. In the enzymatic reaction of glucose.

The effects of the number of horizontal fins. as well as fins length on SOT at different aspect ratios. was investigated. Horizontal fins. owing to their high thermal conductivity. cause uniformity in temperature distribution and improve the heat sink thermal conductivity (positive effect). Incorporating horizontal fins reduces the PCM volume fraction which consequently diminishes the ability of the heat sink to absorb the thermal energy (negative effect). The competition between the former effect and the latter determines the efficacy of adding horizontal fins in the PCM filled heat sinks. As the number of horizontal fins increases up to five. the positive effect is superior to the negative one which in turn enlarges the safe operation time. By the further increase in the number of fins. the negative effect prevailed over the positive effect and therefore the safe operation time diminished. As the heat sink aspect ratio increased. convection heat transfer efficacy becomes more apparent. In this case. it is recommended to use horizontal fins with shorter lengths so that the PCM movement is not disturbed.

1214922,Analysis of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Rehabilitation of Cracked Pressure Vessel Using Finite-element Method (FEM),2020,A Shavalipour and R Karimi,5,Journal of Stress Analysis,1,77-83,Bu-Ali Sina University,Investigation of repaired crack in pressure vessels plays a critical role in the maintenance of cylindrical vessels which are under static loads. Pressurized vessels are critical elements in many industries that may be subjected to degradation and cracking due to working conditions. There are several methods to repair such reservoirs. including welding of damaged points. but this is not possible in some conditions. such as the presence of inflammable materials inside the reservoir. One of the most reliable ways to repair these types of vessels is using composite materials. In this research. crack created in the reservoir is repaired using carbon / epoxy composites. Results of this study confirm the association between the strength of vessels walls and thickness of composite materials. In this paper. the effect of different parameters such as thickness and radius of the reservoir. and composite thickness are investigated. The results show that increasing the thickness of the composite is effective. so by doubling the thickness of composite. stress intensity factor decreases by 13%. Moreover. the use of composites in thin wall tanks is much more effective than the case of a thick reservoir wall.,True,ULmBp3QAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,0,https://iranjournals.nlai.ir/handle/123456789/677875,,,,https://iranjournals.nlai.ir/bitstream/handle/123456789/677875/C0ECB93ADDEB180DDEA18B7679C8428A.pdf?sequence=-1&isAllowed=y,0,0,0

It is well known that the ride comfort is improved by reducing vehicle body acceleration generated by road disturbance. In order to study this phenomenon. Two Degrees of Freedom (DOF) in state space vehicle model was built in. However. the H∞ control method attenuates the agitation effect on the output while H2 is employed to improve the input of the controller. Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) technique is employed to calculate the dynamic controller parameters. The outcome of the simulation revealed that ride comfort for the vehicle upgraded adequately by applying mixed H2/H∞ Control method for active suspension system. and also the mixed H2/H∞ Control method was more effective than the H∞ Control method.,True,ULmBp3QAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,0,https://www.scientific.net/AMM.663.152,,,,,0,0,0

1214928,Using a non-conforming meshes method to simulate an interaction be-tween incompressible flow and rigid and elastic boundaries,2019,Anas Abid Mattie and As’ad ALIZADEH,25,Mechanics,4,276-282,,The interaction between incompressible fluids and elastic and rigid boundaries is seen in many medical. engineering and natural issues. The immersed interface method is used as a non-conforming meshes method to simulate such problems. In this method. the effect of the presence of a body immersed in a fluid is considered by adding a force term to the Navier-Stokes equations. An important advantage of this method is that there is no compulsion to adapt the fluid grids and the boundary grids. First. the flow around a circular cylinder was simulated. As the Reynolds number rises. the vortex dimensions become larger and. as a result. the separation angle of the flow increases. Also. with the Reynolds number increasing. the drag coefficient decreases and the Strouhal number increases and the flow separated from cylinder and two symmetrical vortices is generated behind the cylinder. Then. the behavior of an elastic boundary in shear flow was investigated. It was observed that by increasing bending modulus (increasing stiffness) of body the shape change of the boundary decreases. As well as the tank-treading motion is also observed that this type of movement has been confirmed in experiments. Also observed that the sick cell makes smaller defor-mation. while the normal cell is more deformed and easier passes the stenosis. This results in reduction of the flow rate in stenosis. This behavior is caused by a type of dis-ease called sickle cell anemia.,True,gRPZSKwAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,2,https://www.mechanika.ktu.lt/index.php/Mech/article/view/22975,3319697247469317903,/scholar?cites=3319697247469317903,,https://www.mechanika.ktu.lt/index.php/Mech/article/view/22975/12719,0,0,0

The fluid flow field is solved for using LBM and the interaction between the fluid and the RBC is simulated using the IBM. The RBC is considered as a deformable boundary immersed in the fluid flow. When the RBC is stiffer. the flow passage is further blocked due to the lack of flexibility of the RBC causing the flow velocity to decrease and greater drag force (resistance force against the motion of cell) from the fluid to be exerted on it. As a result. the pressure around the RBC increases and becomes even higher than the inlet pressure of microchannel.

1214936,An Immersed Boundary Method for Computational Simulation of Red Blood Cell in Poiseuille Flow.,2018,Reza Esmaily and Nader Pourmahmoud and Iraj Mirzaee,24,Mechanika,3,,,Blood is a multiphase fluid that is primarily made of red blood cells (RBCs). white blood cells. and platelets suspended in plasma. Under normal. healthy conditions. a freely suspended RBC is a biconcave discoid with 8 µm diameter and 2 µm thickness. RBCs constitute; 40–45% of the total blood volume. Being highly deformable particles. RBCs can easily squeeze through the smallest capillaries having internal diameter less than their characteristic size. The particulate nature of the blood and the deformability of the RBCs determine the overall rheological behavior of the blood [1]. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in combination with IBM has been used for simulating the motion and deformation of elastic bodies immersed in fluid flow including red blood cells (RBCs). Zhang et al.[2. 3] studied the dynamic behavior of RBC in shear flow and channel flow and investigated several hemodynamic and rheological properties. using a combination of LBM and IBM.

The fluid flow occurs due to the pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet of the microchannel. The immersed boundary algorithm guaranteed that there is no relative velocity between the RBC and fluid. Therefore. mass transfer along the immersed border does not occur. It can be seen that the healthy RBC has more deformation and passes the stenosis easier while the sick one passes the stenosis with less deformation and returns to its initial state faster. Increasing the pressure gradient (ie. increasing Reynolds number) would cause more deformation of the RBC. It is found that a healthy RBC moves faster than a sick one along the microchannel. Blood pressure increases due to the presence of stenosis and low deformable RBCs. It is the reason of many serious diseases including cardiovascular diseases.

Besides. exergy loss due to air bubble injection is investigated. Indeed. air bubble injection and bubbles mobility (because of buoyancy force) can intensify the NTU and exergy loss by mixing the thermal boundary layer and increasing the turbulence level of the fluid flow.

For a range of particle sizes from 10 nm to 100 microns and particle volume fractions from 0.00 to 0.04. the simulations were performed for the velocity range of 5–20 m/s. The 3-D governing differential equations were discretized using finite volume method. The influences of size and concentration of micro- and nanoparticles. shear forces. and turbulence on erosion behavior of fluid flow were studied. The model predictions are compared with the earlier studies and a good agreement is found. The results indicate that the erosion rate is directly dependent on particles’ size and volume fraction as well as flow velocity. It has been observed that the maximum pressure has direct relationship with the particle volume fraction and velocity but has a reverse relationship with the particle diameter. It also has been noted that there is a threshold velocity as well as a threshold particle size. beyond which significant erosion effects kick in.

1215081,Modeling approaches to predict biomass co-firing with pulverized coal,2010,Srdan Belosevic,4,The Open Thermodynamics Journal,1,,,The main motivation for co-firing coal with biomass is carbon dioxide emission reduction. while it can also lead to sulfur oxide reduction and suppress formation of nitric oxide from fuel nitrogen. Due to the fact that the coal is mainly used for power generation in its pulverized form. the emphasis in co-firing technologies is often given to co-combustion of pulverized biomass and coal. This facilitates the modeling approach to biomass combustion. since it may be considered in a way similar to the coal dust modeling. On the other hand. when compared to the pulverized coal. there are also significant differences. The differences correspond to the biomass composition depending on its origin. to mostly larger particle size. as well as to an irregular shape of biomass particles. The paper presents a review of modeling approaches and discusses recent progress in prediction of processes during biomass co-firing with pulverized coal. The main aim of the review is to facilitate the selection of submodels and methods to those dealing with the problems of modeling and simulation of practical biomass-coal co-firing systems.

Numerical simulations have been carried out by using an in-house developed computer code. with Euler-Lagrangian approach to the two-phase flow modelling and sub-models for individual phases during complex combustion process: evaporation. devolatilization. combustion of volatiles. and char combustion. For sub-model of coal devolatilization the approach of Merrick is adopted. while for biomass devolatilization the combination models of Merrick. and of Xu and Tomita are selected. Products of devolatilization of both the pulverized coal and biomass are considered to contain the primary gaseous volatiles and tar. which further decomposes to secondary gaseous volatiles and residual soot. The residual soot in tar and carbon in coal and biomass char are oxidized directly. with ash remaining.

1215127,Numerical simulation of porous burners and hole plate surface burners,2004,Stevan Nemoda and Dimosthenis Trimis and Goran Živković,8,Thermal Science,1,3-18,,In comparison to the free flame burners the porous medium burners. especially those with flame stabilization within the porous material. are characterized by a reduction of the combustion zone temperatures and high combustion efficiency. so that emissions of pollutants are minimized. In the paper the finite-volume numerical tool for calculations of the non-isothermal laminar steady-state flow. with chemical reactions in laminar gas flow as well as within porous media is presented. For the porous regions the momentum and energy equations have appropriate corrections. In the momentum equations for the porous region an additional pressure drop has to be considered. which depends on the properties of the porous medium. For the heat transfer within the porous matrix description a heterogeneous model is considered. It treats the solid and gas phase separately. but the phases are coupled via a convective heat exchange term. For the modeling of the reaction of the methane laminar combustion the chemical reaction scheme with 164 reactions and 20 chemical species was used. The proposed numerical tool is applied for the analyses of the combustion and heat transfer processes which take place in porous and surface burners.

For the most part such areas are under special care of the state (i. e. underdeveloped. devastated by war. depopulated). on islands or in mountainous regions. Since the decentralized energy generation covers a broad range of technologies. including many renewable energy technologies that provide small-scale power at sites close to the users. such concept could be of interest for these locations. This paper identifies the areas in Western Balkans where such systems could be applied. Consideration is given to geographical locations as well as possible applications. Wind. hydro. solar photovoltaic. and biomass conversion systems were taken into consideration. Since the renewable energy sources data for Western Balkans region are rather scarce. the intention was to give a survey of the present situation and an estimate of future potential for decentralized energy generation based on renewable energy sources. The decentralized energy generation based on renewable energy sources in Western Balkans will find its niche easier for the users that will produce electricity for their own needs and for the users located in remote rural areas (off-grid applications).,True,uyZhes0AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,29,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/Article.aspx?id=0354-98360703007S,10120647669052924927,/scholar?cites=10120647669052924927,,http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/ft.aspx?id=0354-98360703007S,0,0,0

Proper regulation of coal distribution is deemed essential for achieving an adequate pulverized coal concentration in the zone where thermal plasma is being introduced The said can be efficiently achieved by installation of stationary louver in the coal-air mixing duct ahead of the feed ducts of a burner. The paper addresses numerical simulation of a two-phase flow of air-pulverized coal mixture in the mixing ducts. analysing the effects of particle size distribution on pulverized coal distribution to the burner feed ducts. Numerical simulation was performed rising the FLUENT 63 commercial code and related poly-dispersed flow module. based on the PSI-CELL approach. Numerical experiments have been performed assuming a mono-dispersed solid phase with particle diameter ranging from 45 mu m to 1200 mu m. Distance between the louver blades and the resulting effect on the flow profile was analysed as well.

The research was conducted using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. which is a systematic environmental management tool that analyzes and assesses holistically the environmental impacts of a product or process. This research contributed to further developing LCA research by focusing efforts on hybrid LCA modeling. The context of this research was established through examining green building rating systems. policy review. and project delivery methods with respect to the modeled results. Documented life cycle inventory results focused on PM emissions. GWP. SOx. NOx. CO. Pb. non-methane VOCs. energy usage. and solid and liquid wastes. Results compared with the entire building life cycle indicated that construction. while not as significant as the use phase. is as important as the other life cycle stages. In terms of hybrid LCA modeling. the augmented process based LCA proved to be effective in modeling the construction phase and allowed for efficiently combining process and input-output inventories. Including input-output results. especially construction service sectors. is critical in construction LCA modeling. One case study's results demonstrated that services had the highest level of methane emissions and were a significant contributor to CO2 emissions.

It is imperative to build resilience of large-scale infrastructures like metro systems for addressing the threat of natural disasters and man-made attacks in urban areas. Analysis is needed to ensure that these systems are capable of withstanding and containing unexpected perturbations. and develop heuristic strategies for guiding the design of more resilient networks in the future. We present a comprehensive. multi-pronged framework that analyses information on network topology. spatial organization and passenger flow to understand the resilience of the London metro system. Topology of the London metro system is not fault tolerant in terms of maintaining connectivity at the periphery of the network since it does not exhibit small-world properties.

The results are compared with the ordinary natural gas fuelled cycle. The method involves on- and off-design point performance and exergy analysis.

Operational flexibility of power generation systems is a key aspect when assessing potential solutions seeking to help meeting this expected increase in global energy demand. In low calorific value (LCV) gaseous fuels-fired power plants. it is paramount to consider the effects of the employed LCV/lean-gases-based fuels on the associated gas turbine systems and surrounding equipment. Moreover. because of the industrial processes usually occurring upstream these power plants. the fuel supply conditions change significantly during their normal operation. Gas turbines based on LCV gaseous fuels thus present a quite distinct engine behavior. and their modeling is therefore challenging.

1215229,On-constraint based methods for the generation of Pareto frontiers,2013,Kenneth Chircop and David Zammit-Mangion,3,Journal of Mechanics Engineering and Automation,5,279-289,,Over the years. a number of methods have been proposed for the generation of uniform and globally optimal Pareto frontiers in multi-objective optimization problems. This has been the case irrespective of the problem definition. The most commonly applied methods are the normal constraint method and the normal boundary intersection method. The former suffers from the deficiency of an uneven Pareto set distribution in the case of vertical (or horizontal) sections in the Pareto frontier. whereas the latter suffers from a sparsely populated Pareto frontier when the optimization problem is numerically demanding (ill-conditioned). The method proposed in this paper. coupled with a simple Pareto filter. addresses these two deficiencies to generate a uniform. globally optimal. well-populated Pareto frontier for any feasible bi-objective optimization problem.

The main objective of our research was to design a compact. light and relatively inexpensive system capable of providing the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) in all phases of flight of a small UAV. with a special focus on precision approach and landing. where Vision Based Navigation (VBN) techniques can be fully exploited in a multisensor integrated architecture. Various existing techniques for VBN were compared and the Appearance-Based Approach (ABA) was selected for implementation. Feature extraction and optical flow techniques were employed to estimate flight parameters such as roll angle. pitch angle. deviation from the runway and body rates. Additionally. we addressed the possible synergies between VBN. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and MEMS-IMU (Micro-Electromechanical System Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors. as well as the aiding from Aircraft Dynamics Models (ADMs). In particular. by employing these sensors/models. we aimed to compensate for the shortcomings of VBN and MEMS-IMU sensors in high-dynamics attitude determination tasks. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was developed to fuse the information provided by the different sensors and to provide estimates of position. velocity and attitude of the UAV platform in real-time. Two different integrated navigation system architectures were implemented. The first used VBN at 20 Hz and GPS at 1 Hz to augment the MEMS-IMU running at 100 Hz.

This information would assist the pilot to confidently and objectively assess the viability of continuing or aborting the take-off. Given the nature of the function. it is evident that the indication of the monitor needs to be very reliable. The interpretation of system reliability in this context refers to how closely the quantification of performance perceived by the crew relates to that actually achieved by the aircraft.

In this paper. a novel kind of FDI attack. named tolerable false data injection (TFDI). is constructed. Such attacks exploit the traditional detector’s tolerance of observation errors to bypass the traditional bad data detection. Then. a method based on extended distributed state estimation (EDSE) is proposed to detect TFDI in smart grids. The smart grid is decomposed into several subsystems. exploiting graph partition algorithms. Each subsystem is extended outward to include the adjacent buses and tie lines. and generate the extended subsystem. The Chi-squares test is applied to detect the false data in each extended subsystem. Through decomposition. the false data stands out distinctively from normal observation errors and the detection sensitivity is increased. Extensive TFDI attack cases are simulated in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 14-. 39-. 118-and 300-bus systems. Simulation results show that the detection precision of the EDSE-based method is much higher than that of the traditional method. while the proposed method significantly reduces the associated computational costs.

Battery degradation can be reduced by adding supercapacitors to create a Hybrid Energy Storage System. This paper proposes a systematic approach to configure the hybrid energy storage system and quantifies the battery degradation for electric vehicles when using supercapacitors.

By analyzing continuous driving action in standard driving cycles and special driving phases (start up and acceleration). the supercapacitor size is calculated to provide a compromise between the capacitor size and battery degradation. Estimating the battery degradation after 10 years. the battery capacity loss value decreases 17.55% and 21.6%. respectively. under the urban dynamometer driving schedule and the US06.

The objective of the cycle-related control is to maximize the harvest of the braking energy and minimize battery degradation in various driving styles. Taking the battery case solely as a benchmark and the infinite supercapacitors case as the largest battery degradation mitigation scenario. the battery degradation quantification of the proposed energy storage system shows more than 80% mitigation of the maximum theoretical battery degradation mitigation on urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS). highway fuel economy cycle (HWFET). and high-speed (US06) driving cycle. respectively. During the tested driving cycles. the simulation result indicates the battery degradation reduced by 30% more than the battery solely scenario. which proves the benefit of the proposed system.

In this paper. daily driving pattern models are provided and the profile of minimum-cost-least-fluctuation (MCLF) charging load is achieved to evaluate the impact of PEVs on the regional distribution grid. In the daily driving pattern models. four major elements including departure time. arrival time. number of daily trips and trip distance. which have a great influence on charging behavior. are considered. Driving distance of each trip is well approximated by a truncated power-law.

These resources introduce significant and fast varying uncertainties. In this paper. we focus on reactive power compensation to control voltage in the presence of uncertainties. We adopt a chance constraint approach that accounts for arbitrary correlations between renewable resources at each of the buses. We show how the problem can be solved efficiently using historical samples analogously to the stochastic quasi-gradient methods. We also show that this optimization problem is convex for a wide variety of probabilistic distributions. Compared to conventional per-bus chance constraints. our formulation is more robust to uncertainty and more computationally tractable.

This value is derived through load curtailment to manage the variability of wind power. It increases the opportunity to use wind power and brings economic benefits to the aggregation of the load serving entity (LSE) and the flexible energy consumer. DR is provided by the flexible load through call options offers to the LSE. A transaction mechanism is designed to incentivize the DR aggregator by an appropriate selection of the strike price. It is shown that the strike price should be chosen to be the true value of lost load. A multi-stage decision-theoretic formulation is presented to model the interaction between the aggregator and two settlement markets.

This paper presents a pricing strategy for device-level demand response in a microgrid. The heterogeneity in demand is detected at device-level and the demand response mechanism is designed based on the sensitivity function. which reflects the incentives for time shifting of demand at the device level. The price variation is represented as the reward or penalty to the original price. Three sensitivity functions are discussed and a least-fluctuation optimization model is proposed with the demand response mechanism designed.

One type of LTC engine. the homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. uses a well-mixed fuel–air charge like spark-ignited engines and relies on compression ignition like diesel engines. Similar to diesel engines. the use of high compression ratios and removal of the throttling valve in HCCI allow for high efficiency operation. thereby allowing lower CO2 emissions per unit of work delivered by the engine. The use of a highly diluted well-mixed fuel–air charge allows for low emissions of nitrogen oxides. soot and particulate matters. and the use of oxidation catalysts can allow low emissions of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.

Properly predicting the impact of EVs on the Indian grid will allow better planning of new generation and distribution infrastructure as the EV mission is rolled out. Properly predicting the grid impacts from EVs requires information about the electrical energy consumption of different types of EVs in Indian driving conditions.

We apply detailed physics-based models of electric vehicles with data on how drivers use their cars on a daily basis.

In this paper. we propose a scheme that enables SQL query operations in a blockchain system. In our proposed scheme. the register and query managers provide fast retrieval of range data without any user-defined data structure. and management at low cost without any external database. respectively. We have …,True,FIguFYMAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,3,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3326467.3326479,13587676160207294791,/scholar?cites=13587676160207294791,,,0,0,0
1215316,Distributed Resource Coordination in the Context of European Energy Communities,2020,Jonathan Coignard and Vincent Debusschere and Gilles Moreau and Stéphanie Chollet and Raphaël Caire,,,,1-5,IEEE,As of December 2018. member states of the European Union have two years to implement a framework for renewable energy communities. In countries that have already implemented a framework. the financial balance of local communities is often determined by their ability to coordinate consumption at times when solar panels produce energy. Although. at the moment. local communities do not often control their distributed energy resources (DERs) such as electric vehicles. home equipment. or electric heating. This work aims at comparing a novel local energy market (LEM) framework with a low-tech price reaction mechanism to coordinate DERs in the context of the recent French collective self-consumption framework. Our contribution is two folds: first in developing a literature review at the intersection between transactive energy concepts and recent regulations for collective self-consumption. and second. in …,True,FIguFYMAAAAJ:ufrVoPGSRksC,0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9282075/,,,,,0,0,0

ID (United States),Idaho National Lab (INL) worked with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) to validate the V2G-Sim predicted load profiles using real-world charging data from the San Diego Gas and Electric. Pacific Gas and Electric. and Los Angeles service areas collected from the Electric Vehicle Project (EV Project).The EV Project is one of the largest deployment and evaluation project of electric drive vehicles and charging infrastructure to date. The data collection phase ran for three years (2011 to 2013) and captured almost 125 million miles of driving and 4 million charging events. Over 12.000 Alternative Current (AC) Level 2 (208-240V) charging units and over 100 dual-port Direct Current (DC) fast chargers were deployed in 20 metropolitan areas. Approximately 8.300 Nissan LEAF™.

COtières et Portuaires) est de caractériser le potentiel houlomoteur près des structures portuaires et côtières. comme les digues et jetées. L’article présente l’application d’un modèle nonhydrostatique de propagation et de transformation des vagues en proche côtier SWASH pour deux sites exposés de Bretagne. Les simulations numériques sont effectuées avec SWASH pour les conditions de houle dominante et trois niveaux de marée.

1215319,Projet EMACOP: modélisation numérique des vagues à l'approche de la digue d'Esquibien par le code SWASH,2014,Jonathan Coignard and Bertrand Michard and Jean-Francois Filipot and Philippe Sergent,,,,,,Dans un contexte de développement durable. la tendance actuelle est de se tourner vers des sources alternatives de production d’énergie. Le projet National de Recherche EMACOP (Energies MArines COtières et Portuaires) a entre autres pour objectif de définir le potentiel houlomoteur aux abords d’ouvrages côtiers. Dans le présent travail. une simulation numérique des transformations induites aux vagues à l’approche du site d’Esquibien (Finistère) est réalisée. La modélisation numérique des vagues est effectuée avec le code de calcul SWASH (ZIJLEMA et al.. 2011). Pour chaque simulation. des résultats d’élévation temporelle. de hauteur significative et de spectre directionnel sont obtenus. Les analyses des simulations portent sur l’étude des conditions hivernales moyennes. mais aussi sur l’influence des directions de provenance des vagues. des hauteurs et périodes des houles et des différents niveaux d’eau pour le site d’Esquibien.,True,FIguFYMAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C,0,https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00233/34429/,,,,https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00233/34429/32852.pdf,0,0,0
