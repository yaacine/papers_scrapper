Nevertheless. recent studies have suggested that in certain conditions. reactive astrocytes may provide a permissive substratum to support axonal regrowth. The important criteria. allowing for the distinction between permissive and non-permissive gliosis. are the ultrastructural 3D organization of the scar and more importantly the recognition molecules expressed by reactive astrocytes. Reactive astrocytes express surface molecules and produce various neurotrophic factors and cytokines.

Using adult mice in which hippocampal neurogenesis was ablated. we found specific impairments in spatial discrimination with two behavioral assays: (i) a spatial navigation radial arm maze task and (ii) a spatial. but non-navigable. task in the mouse touch screen. Mice with ablated neurogenesis were impaired when stimuli were presented with little spatial separation. but not when stimuli were more widely separated in space. Thus. newborn neurons may be necessary for normal pattern separation function in the DG of adult mice.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:xm1hsP5ya-EC,1502,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5937/210.abstract,8203654791220108462,/scholar?cites=8203654791220108462,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2997634/,0,0,0

Inc.. A Wiley Company,Neurons are continually born from endogenous stem cells and added to the dentate gyrus throughout life. but adult hippocampal neurogenesis declines precipitously with age. Short‐term exposure to an enriched environment leads to a striking increase in new neurons. along with a substantial improvement in behavioral performance. Could this plastic response be relevant for explaining the beneficial effects of leading “an active life” on brain function and pathology? Adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice living in an enriched environment from the age of 10 to 20 months was fivefold higher than in controls. Relatively. the increase in neuronal phenotypes was entirely at the expense of newly generated astrocytes.

In the present experiments we show that rats given access to a running wheel (Runners) exhibit significantly more short-term potentiation and LTP with θ-patterned conditioning stimulation in vivo than do age-matched litter mates (Controls). This increase in LTP appears to reflect an alteration in the induction threshold for synaptic plasticity that accompanies voluntary exercise. Weak θ-patterned stimulation. which did not produce LTP in control subjects. produced a robust and long-lasting LTP in Runners. LTP induction in both groups was dependent upon the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. and could be blocked by the competitive antagonist [±]-3-[2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl] propanephosphonic acid.

We further show that retrotransposition of a human L1 in transgenic mice results in neuronal somatic mosaicism.

In contrast. repair mechanisms in the adult central nervous system (CNS) have long been thought to be very limited. However. recent findings have clearly demonstrated that in restricted areas of the mammalian brain. new functional neurons are constantly generated from neural stem cells throughout life. Moreover. stem cells with the potential to give rise to new neurons reside in many different regions of the adult CNS. These findings raise the possibility that endogenous neural stem cells can be mobilized to replace dying neurons in neurodegenerative diseases.

Rare mutations in Nurr1 are associated with familial Parkinson's disease. but the underlying basis for this relationship has not been established. Here. we demonstrate that Nurr1 unexpectedly functions to inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory neurotoxic mediators in both microglia and astrocytes. Reduced Nurr1 expression results in exaggerated inflammatory responses in microglia that are further amplified by astrocytes. leading to the production of factors that cause death of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons. Nurr1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by docking to NF-κB-p65 on target inflammatory gene promoters in a signal-dependent manner. Subsequently.

This transcriptional regulatory mechanism was dependent on a DNA element containing overlapping Sox2 and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF)-binding sites (Sox/LEF) in the promoter. Notably. Sox/LEF sites were also found in long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) elements. consistent with their critical roles in the transition of NSCs to proliferating neuronal progenitors.

To understand the CNS. scientists have investigated a variety of molecules. including proteins. lipids. and various small molecules. However. one large class of molecules. noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). has been relatively unexplored. ncRNAs function directly as structural. catalytic. or regulatory molecules rather than serving as templates for protein synthesis.

Here. we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First. immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time. a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second. the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect. supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally. our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently.

Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in fine-tuning gene networks. the roles of individual miRNAs in vertebrate neural development have not been studied in vivo. We investigated the function of the most abundant neuronal miRNA. miR-124. during spinal cord development. Neither inhibition nor overexpression of miR-124 significantly altered the acquisition of neuronal fate. suggesting that miR-124 is unlikely to act as a primary determinant of neuronal differentiation. Two endogenous targets of miR-124. laminin γ1 and integrin β1. were identified. both of which are highly expressed by neural progenitors but repressed upon neuronal differentiation.

Developing neurons of the adult hippocampus have been described in depth. However. little is known about their functional properties as they become fully mature dentate granule cells (DGCs). To compare mature DGCs generated during development and adulthood. NPCs were labeled at both time points using retroviruses expressing different fluorescent proteins. Sequential electrophysiological recordings from neighboring neurons of different ages were carried out to quantitatively study their major synaptic inputs: excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex and inhibitory afferents from local interneurons. Our results show that DGCs generated in the developing and adult hippocampus display a remarkably similar afferent connectivity with regard to both glutamate and GABA. the major neurotransmitters. We also demonstrate that adult-born neurons can fire action potentials in response to an excitatory drive. exhibiting a firing behavior comparable to that of neurons generated during development.

There is a need for improved differentiation and enrichment procedures that generate highly pure populations of neural stem cells (NSC). glia and neurons. One way to address this problem is to identify cell-surface signatures that enable the isolation of these cell types from heterogeneous cell populations by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS).   Methodology/Principal Findings We performed an unbiased FACS- and image-based immunophenotyping analysis using 190 antibodies to cell surface markers on naïve human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and cell derivatives from neural differentiation cultures. From this analysis we identified prospective cell surface signatures for the isolation of NSC. glia and neurons. We isolated a population of NSC that was CD184+/CD271−/CD44−/CD24+ from neural induction cultures of hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). Sorted NSC could be propagated for many passages and could differentiate to mixed cultures of neurons and glia in vitro and in vivo. A population of neurons that was CD184−/CD44−/CD15LOW/CD24+ and a population of glia that was CD184+/CD44+ were subsequently purified from cultures of differentiating NSC.

Astrocytes. which make up the largest glial population. are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity during postnatal development 2. Because defects in astrocyte generation are associated with severe neurological disorders such as brain tumours 3. it is important to understand how astrocytes are produced. Astrocytes reportedly arise from two sources 4. 5. 6: radial glia in the ventricular zone and progenitors in the subventricular zone. with the contribution from each region shifting with time. During the first three weeks of postnatal development. the glial cell population. which contains predominantly astrocytes. expands 6–8-fold in the rodent brain 7.

In order to test the hypothesis that calcium binding proteins protect against the effects of prolonged stimulation. intracellular recordings were made in hippocampal slices from cells that lack immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Calcium binding protein-negative cells showed electrophysiological signs of deterioration during prolonged stimulation; cells containing calcium binding protein did not. When neurons without calcium binding proteins were impaled with microelectrodes containing the calcium chelator BAPTA. and BAPTA was allowed to diffuse into the cells. these cells showed no deterioration.

Supplementum,,9-18,,Dissociated dopamine-rich cell suspensions were prepared from the ventral mesencephalon of rat embryos and injected in one or several sites in striatal and non-striatal regions in the dopaminergically denervated brain of adult rats. While the grafts survived well in all sites. the dopamine fibre outgrowth was markedly different depending on whether the grafts occurred in an area normally innervated by the mesencephalic dopamine neurones (ie neostriatum or nc. accumbens) or in areas not normally innervated by these neurones (ie parietal cortex. lateral hypothalamus or substantia nigra). Moreover. in grafts placed at different sites along the trajectory of the nigrostriatal pathway the outgrowing fibres remained confined to the graft. and there was little evidence that the implanted neurones could elongate their axons along the pathway of the nigrostriatal tract to reach the striatum from a distance. Thus. the intracerebral suspension grafts provided efficient reinnervation of a denervated target only when placed in the immediate vicinity of the target area. The results of multiple graft placements indicate that a relatively complete restoration of a lost innervation should be possible to achieve in large areas of the brain. such as the striatal complex. with the suspension grafting technique.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:MvIMIWP2nqIC,269,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6586058,553225289385695080,/scholar?cites=553225289385695080,,,0,0,0

L1s comprise nearly ∼20% of the human genome and are able to influence chromosome integrity and gene expression upon reinsertion. Recent studies show that L1 elements are active and ‘jumping’ during neuronal differentiation. New somatic L1 insertions could generate ‘genomic plasticity’ in neurons by causing variation in genomic DNA sequences and by altering the transcriptome of individual cells. Thus.

In HC2S2-immortalized hippocampal progenitors. nicotine is cytotoxic to undifferentiated cells. whereas it spares the same cells once differentiation has been induced. The activation of α-Bgt-AChRs by nicotine results in the induction of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the cdk inhibitor p21.

Chronic NGF infusion into the adult neostrium resulted in reexpression of the NGF receptor such that many cholinergic interneurons became immunoreactive for NGF receptor. NGF infusion dramatically increased the size and choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity of these same cholinergic neurons.

We found that the loss of hexokinase (HK2) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA) expression. together with a switch in pyruvate kinase gene splicing from PKM2 to PKM1. marks the transition from aerobic glycolysis in neural progenitor cells (NPC) to neuronal oxidative phosphorylation. The protein levels of c-MYC and N-MYC. transcriptional activators of the HK2 and LDHA genes. decrease dramatically. Constitutive expression of HK2 and LDHA during differentiation leads to neuronal cell death. indicating that the shut-off aerobic glycolysis is essential for neuronal survival.

Neural electrical activity is the essence of nervous system function in vivo. Therefore. we examined neuronal activity in media widely used to culture neurons. We found that classic basal media. as well as serum. impair action potential generation and synaptic communication.

An inherited form is caused by a dominant mutation in the ubiquitously expressed superoxide dismutase (SOD1). SOD1 mutant expression within motor neurons is a determinant of onset and early disease. and mutant accumulation within microglia accelerates disease progression. Muscle also is a likely primary source for toxicity. because retraction of motor axons from synaptic connections to muscle is among the earliest presymptomatic events. To test involvement of muscle in ALS. viral delivery of transcription-mediated siRNA is shown to suppress mutant SOD1 accumulation within muscle alone but to be insufficient to maintain grip strength. whereas delivery to both motor neurons and muscle is sufficient.

In the present experiment. we determined whether intraparenchymal transplants of primary autologous cells genetically modified to produce nerve growth factor (NGF) would prevent injury-induced degeneration of cholinergic neurons. Cultured primary monkey fibroblasts were genetically modified to produce human NGF. and secreted 13.2 ng NGF/10 (6) cells/h in vitro. Adult monkeys then underwent fornix transections to induce degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. and received autologous grafts of either NGF-producing or control. beta-galactosidase-producing fibroblasts directly into the basal forebrain region. One month later. 61.7+/-8.9% of cholinergic neurons remained indentifiable in NGF-graft recipients compared to 26.2+/-5.0% in control graft recipients (P< 0.02). Neuronal protection correlated with the accuracy of graft placement: up to 92% protection from neuronal degeneration occurred when NGF-secreting grafts were accurately placed immediately adjacent to injured neurons. Thus. intraparenchymal NGF delivery to the adult primate brain by gene transfer can prevent the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Gene therapy can target intraparenchymal brain sites for regionally specific neurotrophin delivery. thereby avoiding limitations imposed by diffusion of substances across the blood-brain barrier and through CNS parenchyma. while avoiding adverse effects of neurotrophic factors delivered in a non-directed manner to the central nervous system.

Specifically. the heterogeneity of this population has not been adequately addressed for the adult CNS and while NG2 cells continue to divide in the adult CNS it is not clear what function they serve once myelination is complete.

Particularly. the dentate gyrus (DG) is hypothesized to perform pattern separation by forming distinct representations of similar inputs. How pattern separation is achieved by the DG remains largely unclear. By examining neuronal activities at a population level. we revealed that. unlike CA1 neuron populations. dentate granule cell (DGC) ensembles activated by learning were not preferentially reactivated by memory recall. Moreover. when mice encountered an environment to which they had not been previously exposed. a novel DGC population—rather than the previously activated DGC ensembles that responded to past events—was selected to represent the new environmental inputs. This selection of a novel responsive DGC population could be triggered by small changes in environmental inputs. Therefore. selecting distinct DGC populations to represent similar but not identical inputs is a mechanism for pattern separation.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00312.001,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:8EvVLpklxGMC,149,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00312,11956319153692913794,/scholar?cites=11956319153692913794,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/00312.pdf,0,0,0

While much effort had been undertaken to analyze transcriptional and epigenetic differences during the transition of hESC to NP. very little work has been performed to understand post-transcriptional changes during neuronal differentiation. Alternative RNA splicing (AS). a major form of post-transcriptional gene regulation. is important in mammalian development and neuronal function. Human ESC. hESC-derived NP. and human central nervous system stem cells were compared using Affymetrix exon arrays. We introduced an outlier detection approach. REAP (Regression-based Exon Array Protocol). to identify 1.737 internal exons that are predicted to undergo AS in NP compared to hESC. Experimental validation of REAP-predicted AS events indicated a threshold-dependent sensitivity ranging from 56% to 69%. at a specificity of 77% to 96%. REAP predictions significantly overlapped sets of alternative events identified using expressed sequence tags and evolutionarily conserved AS events. Our results also reveal that focusing on differentially expressed genes between hESC and NP will overlook 14% of potential AS genes.

Recent evidence suggests that nucleoporins. well known components that control nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. have wide-ranging functions in developmental gene regulation that potentially extend beyond their role in nuclear transport. Whether the unexpected role of nuclear pore proteins in transcription regulation. which initially has been described in fungi and flies. also applies to human cells is unknown. Here we show at a genome-wide level that the nuclear pore protein NUP98 associates with developmentally regulated genes active during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. Overexpression of a dominant negative fragment of NUP98 levels decreases expression levels of NUP98-bound genes. In addition. we identify two modes of developmental gene regulation by NUP98 that are differentiated by the spatial localization of NUP98 target genes. Genes in the initial stage of developmental induction can associate with NUP98 that is embedded in the nuclear pores at the nuclear periphery. Alternatively. genes that are highly induced can interact with NUP98 in the nuclear interior. away from the nuclear pores.

We found that after exposure to different external signals in vitro. the environment is capable of redirecting the fate of a particular cell. even in the case of the bipotent precursor cell whose default differentiation pathway was neurons only.

This revolutionary finding was initially met with resistance by the scientific community and viewed by some as heretical. A large body of knowledge has accumulated over the last 60 years on the biology of TEs. Indeed. it is now known that TEs can generate genomic instability and reconfigure gene expression networks both in the germline and somatic cells. This review highlights recent findings on the role of TEs in health and diseases of the CNS. which were presented at the 2013 Society for Neuroscience meeting. The work of the speakers in this symposium shows that TEs are expressed and active in the brain. challenging the dogma that neuronal genomes are static and revealing that they are susceptible to …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:InLRhUNj-rwC,135,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/45/17577.short,18096732260448952495,/scholar?cites=18096732260448952495,,https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/33/45/17577.full.pdf,0,0,0

Numerous advances have been made in the construction of expression vectors. cellular and viral transgene carriers. and the characterization of target cells for neuronal gene therapy. Two primary approaches to nervous system gene transfer have emerged as a result of these advances. Thein vivo approachconcentrates on direct transfer of genetic material to cells in vivo using viral and chemical agents. Theex vivo approachrelies on genetic transfer to cultured cells that are subsequently implanted into a host organism. Both of these methods have been used in preliminary experiments designed to test the efficacy of gene transfer strategies in the amelioration of nervous system dysfunction.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:uQyLbZAWguAC,135,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/592635,17338728488061667715,/scholar?cites=17338728488061667715,,,0,0,0

Experiments were therefore performed to determine if acquisition behavior on this task could predict the degree of cortical cholinergic deafferentation and if the acquisition deficit could be pharmacologically reversed. Performance on acquisition was highly correlated with the lesion-induced reduction in cortical choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. Accuracy of spatial behavior was highly correlated to percentage ChAT depletion (r = 0.75). Neither lesioned rats nor controls displayed a retention deficit after a 9-day interval. nor did either group display a passive-avoidance retention deficit.

Supplementum,,49-58,,The survival and growth of intrahippocampal septal suspension grafts were investigated by acetylcholine esterase (AChE) histochemistry in animals with lesions of the intrinsic septohippocampal cholinergic pathways. AChE was demonstrable in the grafts after the first postoperative week. and AChE-positive fibres were seen to extend into the host hippocampus by 3 weeks. Rapid fibre outgrowth occurred between 3 weeks and 3 months after grafting. and continued at a slower rate thereafter. By 6 months a fairly complete reinnervation of the initially denervated hippocampus was achieved in most specimens. and this persisted at 14 months. the longest postoperative time analysed. A comparison between the development of the AChE-positive neurones in the suspension grafts with that seen during ontogeny in situ suggested that the grafted neurones lagged behind normal development by at least 1 week. Similar to our previous observations on septal grafts implanted as solid tissue pieces. the pattern of the newly-formed AChE-positive innervation in the host hippocampal formation. established from the septal suspension grafts. was remarkably similar to that of the normal AChE-positive septal innervation. This pattern became established as soon as the graft-derived fibres first grew in. suggesting that the ingrowing axons extended and ramified preferentially into those hippocampal subfields which normally receive an AChE-positive innervation from the septal-diagonal band area.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:IF0FbId8XVwC,116,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6586055,14141865774320103803,/scholar?cites=14141865774320103803,,,0,0,0

Here. we show that tau can directly interact with nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and affect their structural and functional integrity. Pathological tau impairs nuclear import and export in tau-overexpressing transgenic mice and in human AD brain tissue. Furthermore. the nucleoporin Nup98 accumulates in the cell bodies of some tangle-bearing neurons and can facilitate tau aggregation in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that tau can directly interact with NPC components. leading to their mislocalization and consequent disruption of NPC function.

Lesions of the NB result in neocortical slow delta waves. similar to the action of antimuscarinic drugs. and the lesion releases the oscillation of GABAergic neurons in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. resulting in high voltage neocortical spindles. Extensive damage of the thalamus does not produce slowing of neocortical activity but it abolishes neocortical spindles. We suggest that the NB plays a key role in neocortical activation by a) blocking the afterhyperpolarizations and accommodation in neocortical pyramidal neurons and b) suppressing the rhythm generation in the reticular nucleus-thalamocortical circuitry.

Inc.,Metabolomics enables the discovery of small molecules that may serve as candidate biomarkers of pharmacological efficacy or toxicity. Biochemical pathways of human development are likely active in human embryonic stem (hES) cells and derivatives. since they recapitulate organogenesis in vitro. We hypothesized that small molecules could be measured from undifferentiated hES cells and hES cell-derived neural precursors (hNPs) using metabolomics and that these compounds are altered in response to known disruptors of human development. Metabolite profiling was performed in hES cells and hNPs after exposure to valproate. an inducer of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Fibre outgrowth into the host brain was evaluated in animals which were subjected to lesions of the intrinsic nigrostriatal or septohippocampal system 6-10 days before killing. Dense dopamine fibre outgrowth was seen within a zone of up to about 1 mm radius around the nigral implants. and dense growth of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) positive fibres occurred up to about 2 mm away from the septal implants. The overall magnitude of fibre outgrowth was less than that generally seen in previously denervated targets in young adult recipients. but it appeared to be as extensive as in young recipients when the grafts are placed in non-denervated targets. The distribution of the AChE-positive fibres from the septal implants in the host hippocampus suggested that the pattern found in the non-denervated target of the aged recipients was more diffuse. and partly different. from normal. and that age-dependent synapse loss in intrinsic connections may influence the patterning of the graft-derived innervation.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:uqZYSrDi9MMC,87,https://europepmc.org/article/med/6586057,14047009036248261231,/scholar?cites=14047009036248261231,,,0,0,0

Rapamycin treatment significantly improves the resistance of MILS neurons to glutamate toxicity. Surprisingly. in mitochondrially defective neurons. but not neuroprogenitor cells. ribosomal S6 and S6 kinase phosphorylation increased over time. despite activation of AMPK. which is often linked to mTOR inhibition.

The computational process for making representations of similar input patterns more distinct from each other has been referred to as “pattern separation.” Although adult‐born immature neurons have been implicated in this memory feature. the precise role of these neurons and associated molecules in the processing of overlapping memories is unknown. Recently. we found that brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus is required for the encoding/consolidation of overlapping memories. In this study. we provide evidence that consolidation of these “pattern‐separated” memories requires the action of BDNF on immature neurons specifically. © 2014 The Authors.

We examine the three-dimensional organization of evoked and spontaneous physiological patterns of the hippocampus and suggest rules how these patterns emerge during different behaviors from a hard-wired structural network. The high spatial coherence of theta activity is due to an external pacemaker. while the high synchrony of population bursts underlying hippocampal sharp waves is explained by the similar probability of recruitment of neurons by the burst-initiator cells along the whole extent of the hippocampus.

Zinc is a constituent of the 7S Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) molecule. The hippocampal area is rich in neurotrophic factors and cholinergic deafferentation of the hippocampus appears to activate these neurotrophic factors.In this paper we report that cholinergic deafferentation of the hippocampus causes a transient rise in mossy-fiber zinc. as measured by zinc-dithizonate histochemistry. The changes are not significant until 10 days after the septal lesion. and the zinc returns to control levels by 21–28 days.Dithizonate has an association constant of 10−15 with zinc. while NGF has an association constant of 10−11.

This temporal separation is accomplished in part through the continual generation of new neurons. which. due to a transient window of hyperexcitability. could allow for preferential encoding of information present during their development. Here we obtain in vivo electrophysiological recordings and identify a cell population exhibiting activity that is selective to single contexts when rats experience a long temporal separation between context exposures during training. This selectivity is attenuated as the temporal separation between context exposures is shortened and is further attenuated when neurogenesis is reduced.

Nucleoporins are linked with cell-type-specific gene regulation. coupling physical changes in nuclear structure to transcriptional output; but. whether and how they coordinate with key fate-determining transcription factors is unclear. Here we show that the nucleoporin Nup153 interacts with Sox2 in adult NeuPCs. where it is indispensable for their maintenance and controls neuronal differentiation. Genome-wide analyses show that Nup153 and Sox2 bind and co-regulate hundreds of genes.

The steady-state level of Aβ peptide in the brain is determined by the rate of production from amyloid precursor protein (APP) via β- and γ-secretases and degradation by the activity of several enzymes. Neprilysin (NEP) appears to be the most potent Aβ peptide-degrading enzyme in the brain. Decreasing the activity of NEP (due to genetic mutations. age or diseases that alter the expression or activity of NEP) may lead to accumulation of the neurotoxic Aβ peptide in the brain; in turn this leads to neuronal loss. We investigated the efficacy of lentivirus-mediated over-expression of NEP to protect neuronal cells from Aβ peptide in vitro.

Here we show that SRY-box-containing gene 2 (Sox2) and nuclear receptor tailless (TLX) form a molecular network in adult NSCs. We observed that both Sox2 and TLX proteins bind to the upstream region of Tlx gene. Sox2 positively regulates Tlx expression. whereas the binding of TLX to its own promoter suppresses its transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays. Such TLX-mediated suppression can be antagonized by overexpressing wild-type Sox2 but not a mutant lacking the transcriptional activation domain.

Myelination enables neurons to transmit information more quickly and more efficiently and allows for more complex brain functions; yet. remarkably. the underlying mechanism by which myelination occurs is still not fully understood. A reliable in vitro assay is essential to dissect oligodendrocyte and myelin biology.

The effects of NGF are thought to be mediated through the high-affinity tyrosine receptor kinase trkA and the low-affinity p75 receptor (2). Several studies suggest that the p75 receptor initiates an apoptotic signal that leads to neuronal death (3). The role of NGF in the development and survival of central neurons in intact systems is less clear.

The dominant electrical pattern of the graft consisted of irregularly occurring sharp waves (SPW) or EEG spikes of 30–150 ms duration and concurrent synchronous neuronal bursts of large cell populations. SPWs occurred during all behaviors but their frequency was significantly lower during running than during drinking. Population bursts of neurons in the graft could be evoked by stimulating either the ipsilateral host hippocampus or the perforant path.

One transmitter system. the cholinergic system. shows several distinct responses to damage in the septohippocampal circuit. Present evidence strongly supports a role for nerve growth factor (NGF) in these responses. NGF is not only important for the survival of the adult cholinergic neurons. but can also induce regrowth of the damaged fibers given an appropriate substratum for growth. These reparative effects of NGF can manifest themselves in functional recovery in the aged rat and the young rat with fimbria-fornix lesions.

We hypothesized that cognitive function. such as spatial learning. may be a reproducible and sensitive outcome variable. We developed an animal model of multifocal cerebral ischemia in order to study the effects of infarction on learning. To cause ischemia. several hundred microspheres were injected into the internal carotid arteries of rats. After ischemia. behavior was measured using a global rating and a Morris water maze.

10090332,Molecular mechanisms of bipolar disorder: progress made and future challenges,2017,Yeni Kim and Renata Santos and Fred H Gage and Maria C Marchetto,11,,,30,Frontiers,Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and progressive psychiatric illness characterized by mood oscillations. with episodes of mania and depression. The impact of BD on patients can be devastating. with up to 15% of patients committing suicide. This disorder is associated with psychiatric and medical comorbidities and patients with a high risk of drug abuse. metabolic and endocrine disorders and vascular disease. Current knowledge of the pathophysiology and molecular mechanisms causing BD is still modest. With no clear biological markers available. early diagnosis is a great challenge to clinicians without previous knowledge of the longitudinal progress of illness. Moreover. despite recommendations from evidence-based guidelines. polypharmacy is still common in clinical treatment of BD. reflecting the gap between research and clinical practice. A major challenge in BD is the development of effective drugs with low toxicity for the patients. In this review we focus on the progress made and future challenges we face in determining the pathophysiology and molecular pathways involved in BD. such as circadian and metabolic perturbations. mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction. autophagy and glutamatergic neurotransmission; which may lead to the development of new drugs.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:0z-ogHnYXbUC,52,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2017.00030/full,4989568219762926333,/scholar?cites=4989568219762926333,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2017.00030/full,0,0,0

Maintenance of self-renewal and multipotency of adult NSCs is controlled by multiple transcription factor networks. We show here that paired related homeobox protein Prx1 (MHox1/Prrx1) plays an important role in the maintenance of adult NSCs. Prx1 works with the transcription factor Sox2 as a coactivator. and depletion of Prx1 in cultured adult mouse NSCs reduces their self-renewal. In addition. we find that Prx1 protein is expressed in Sox2+/GFAP+/Nestin+ astrocytes in the germinal regions of the adult mouse forebrain.

Direct fibroblast-to-induced neuron (iN) conversion yields functional neurons that retain important signs of aging. in contrast to iPSC differentiation. Here. we analyzed mitochondrial features in iNs from individuals of different ages. iNs from old donors display decreased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-related gene expression. impaired axonal mitochondrial morphologies. lower mitochondrial membrane potentials. reduced energy production. and increased oxidized proteins levels. In contrast. the fibroblasts from which iNs were generated show only mild age-dependent changes. consistent with a metabolic shift from glycolysis-dependent fibroblasts to OXPHOS-dependent iNs.

The ACh produced from the transduced fibroblasts was found to be enhanced by increasing amounts of choline chloride in the culture media. These dChAT‐expressing cells were then implanted into the intact hippocampus of adult rats and in vivo microdialysis was performed 7–10 days after grafting to assess the ability of the cells to produce ACh and respond to exogenous choline in vivo. Samples collected from anesthetized rats revealed fourfold higher levels of ACh around dChAT grafts than from either non‐grafted or control‐grafted hippocampi. Localized choline infusion (200 μ) through the dialysis probes was found to induce a selective twofold increase in ACh release only from the dChAT‐expressing fibroblasts.

NRSE smRNA. which are non-coding dsRNAs about 20 bp in length. reside in the nucleus and play a critical role in mediating neuronal differentiation. These smRNAs carry the sequence of NRSE/RE1. which is recognized by the NRSF/REST transcription factor. The NRSE sequences are embedded widely in the genomic region. typically in promoters of neuron-specific genes. The mechanism of action appears to be mediated through a specific interaction between dsRNA and DNA/protein interaction. rather than through siRNA or miRNA.

After grafting. extensive reinnervation was observed by 5HT-immunoreactive fibres. many of which appeared to make contacts with host motoneurones. The neurotransmitter complement was apparently normal. There was also a reinstatement of 5HT levels in the denervated cord after transplantation. amounting to some 40% of normal at the level of the graft. Similarly. Na+-dependent uptake of [3H]-5HT into P3 fractions was over 40% of that recorded in unlesioned animals. Antidromic stimulation of the ventral roots of the spinal cord was used to assess the degree of motoneurone excitability.

Psychobiology benefits from taxonomies provided by biology and chemistry. which include not only object oriented taxonomies such as species or chemical elements. but also process oriented taxonomies. such as oxidation. metabolism. phototaxis. or predation. Psychobiology has yet to provide equivalent taxonomies for its behavioral observations. although the common use of terms such as fear. anger. arousal. stress. and memory might lead one to suppose that these are based on a well established taxonomy of behavioral measures.In this report the logical and quantitative requirements for treating behavioral measures in terms of taxonomic classes are reviewed.

Risk for BD is genetically encoded and overlaps with systems that maintain circadian rhythms. Lithium is an effective mood stabilizer treatment for BD. but only a minority of patients fully respond to monotherapy. Presently. we hypothesized that lithium-responsive BD patients (Li-R) would show characteristic differences in chronotype and cellular circadian rhythms compared to lithium non-responders (Li-NR). Selecting patients from a prospective. multi-center. clinical trial of lithium monotherapy. we examined morning vs. evening preference (chronotype) as a dimension of circadian rhythm function in 193 Li-R and Li-NR BD patients.

Retroviruses receive their name from the fact that their genome undergoes conversion from RNA to DNA following infection of a host cell. Also characteristic of retroviruses and uncommon for most other types of viruses is that the genome of the retrovirus integrates itself permanently into the DNA of the host cell. Once integrated into the host genome. the inserted provirus acts as a factory for producing more retroviral RNA genomes and expressing retroviral packaging proteins.

10090441,A hypothesis for temporal coding of young and mature granule cells,2013,Lara M Rangel and Laleh K Quinn and Andrea A Chiba and Fred H Gage and James B Aimone,7,Frontiers in neuroscience,,75,Frontiers,While it has been hypothesized that adult neurogenesis plays a role in the encoding of temporal information at long time scales. the temporal relationship of immature cells to the highly rhythmic network activity of the hippocampus has been largely unexplored. Here. we present a theory for how the activity of immature adult-born granule cells relates to hippocampal oscillations. Our hypothesis is that theta rhythmic (5-10 Hz) excitatory and inhibitory inputs into the hippocampus could differentially affect young and mature granule cells due to differences in intrinsic physiology and synaptic inhibition between the two cell populations. Consequently. immature cell activity may occur at broader ranges of theta phase than the activity of their mature counterparts. We describe how this differential influence on young and mature granule cells could separate the activity of differently aged neurons in a temporal coding regime. Notably. this process could have considerable implications on how the downstream CA3 region interprets the information conveyed by young and mature granule cells. To begin to investigate the phasic behavior of granule cells. we analyzed in vivo recordings of the rat dentate gyrus. observing that the temporal behavior of granule cells with respect to the theta rhythm is different between rats with normal and impaired levels of neurogenesis. Specifically. in control animals. granule cells exhibit both strong and weak coupling to the phase of the theta rhythm. In contrast. the distribution of phase relationships in neurogenesis-impaired rats is shifted such that they are significantly stronger.

During the development. an abundance of neurons are born and form connections. yet a much smaller number of these cells and connections are maintained into adulthood. The importance of trophic interactions mediated by diffusable agents during neural development was first proposed by Ramon y Cajal. The possibility that trophic agents mediate survival during the development has since been elaborated by others and formulated into the “neurotrophic hypothesis.” The general hypothesis provides a framework with which to contrast and compare trophic molecules in a detailed developmental process.

10090471,Distinct roles of NMDA receptors at different stages of granule cell development in the adult brain,2015,Yangling Mu and Chunmei Zhao and Nicolas Toni and Jun Yao and Fred H Gage,4,Elife,,e07871,eLife Sciences Publications Limited,NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity are thought to underlie the assembly of developing neuronal circuits and to play a crucial role in learning and memory. It remains unclear how NMDAR might contribute to the wiring of adult-born granule cells (GCs). Here we demonstrate that nascent GCs lacking NMDARs but rescued from apoptosis by overexpressing the pro-survival protein Bcl2 were deficient in spine formation. Insufficient spinogenesis might be a general cause of cell death restricted within the NMDAR-dependent critical time window for GC survival. NMDAR loss also led to enhanced mushroom spine formation and synaptic AMPAR activity throughout the development of newborn GCs. Moreover. similar elevated synapse maturation in the absence of NMDARs was observed in neonate-generated GCs and CA1 pyramidal neurons. Together. these data suggest that NMDAR operates as a molecular monitor for controlling the activity-dependent establishment and maturation rate of synaptic connections between newborn neurons and others.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07871.001,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:EXDW3tg14iEC,23,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07871,13919861604122626859,/scholar?cites=13919861604122626859,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/07871.pdf,0,0,0

Generally. a drug resistance gene is inserted with the modified gene to select correctly targeted clones. Often. however. the presence of this drug resistance gene interferes with the normal locus and creates a null or hypomorphic allele. Flanking of the selectable marker by loxP sites followed by Cre‐mediated deletion after drug selection can overcome this problem. The simplest method used to remove a loxP‐flanked selectable marker is to breed an animal carrying a loxP‐flanked drug resistance gene to an animal that expresses Cre recombinase in the germline. To date only outbred transgenic mice are available for this purpose.

10090499,Regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase expression,2001,Kazuhiro Sakurada and Theo Palmer and Fred H Gage,,,,,,2. Background Information During development. neural Stem cells differentiate into the different types of neurons and glia found in the adult central nervous System (CNS) and peripheral nervous Sys tem (PNS). In general. these different types of neurons are classified based on the particular types of neurotransmitters they produce. For example. dopaminergic neurons produce dopamine. while noradrenergic neurons produce norepi nephrine. The neurotransmitters dopamine and norepineph rine belong to a class of compounds called catecholamines. A catecholamine is an ortho-dihydroxyphenylalkylamine that is derived from the common cellular metabolite tyrosine. For example. the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine are Synthesized from tyrosine as follows: tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalamine (DOPA) by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH).

Overexpression of human RFT (RFT-A) reduces FGF-2 RNA and protein levels in both normal and tumor cell lines. Its splice variants.

The time course of this growth parallels the changes in behavior seen after septal lesions. This study determined quantitatively which pattern of behavioral changes was most closely associated with the growth of sympathetic fibers. We found two patterns of behavioral change associated with the growing fibers. One pattern was of “recovery” behaviors. whereas the other was of “deficit” behaviors. The recovery behaviors included tactile reactivity and open-field activity. The deficit behaviors included shock and heat reactivity. In addition. we argue that the fluorescence intensity measure of sympathetic fibers that relates to neurotransmitter content is most appropriate to use in future studies of behavior. because this measure was consistently well correlated with behavioral changes.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:lAj_JhtUatoC,18,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03332970,5137098053342678461,/scholar?cites=5137098053342678461,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03332970.pdf,0,0,0

Heidelberg,During development. nerve cells in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) are generated by the proliferation of multipotent stem or progenitor cells that migrate. find their site of final destination and ultimately terminally differentiate. However. the mechanisms for development of diversified cell types in the CNS and the environmental stimuli involved in these processes are not well understood. In analogy with the hematopoietic system. it has been proposed that during CNS development. a self-renewing population of stem cells gives rise to a more restrictive population of progenitor cells. However. the existence of these elusive progenitor cells has not been proven due to the unavailability of specific phenotypic markers. In the adult brain only a small number of stem cells exist and they differentiate into neurons at specific neurogenic sites at a slow rate (Morshead et al.. 1994; Kuhn et al.. 1996).,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:KD63RgGzVVoC,11,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-58552-4_11,14464654254664347632,/scholar?cites=14464654254664347632,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brent_Reynolds/publication/6658040_Neural_Stem_Cell_Isolation_and_Characterization/links/5e1df1ab45851536bfe62c90/Neural-Stem-Cell-Isolation-and-Characterization.pdf,0,0,0

Although the mechanisms behind this phenomenon have not been elucidated. one likely cause is the response of the host to the graft. For example. genetically modified fibroblasts grafted into the brain are surrounded by activated microglia and astrocytes. The apparent inflammatory response can last for several weeks. In addition. the center of the graft is typically infiltrated with macrophage-like cells that appear to reside continuously within the graft. This proximity of inflammatory cells to the graft suggests that these cells may somehow influence transgene expression.

The resultant decrease of dopamine-containing fibers within the striatum (see Fig. 1a) is associated with several sensory and motor impairments. particularly tremor. rigidity. and akinesia. Initially. these symptoms can be effectively controlled by oral administration of levodopa (L-dopa). a molecular precursor to dopamine that can penetrate the bloodbrain barrier. As the L-dopa diffuses throughout the brain. residual nigral terminals within the striatum are capable of capturing the L-dopa and converting it to useable dopamine.

In addition. deficits in balance and coordination of central nervous system origin must be dissociated from motor deficits of peripheral origin such as muscle atrophy. The problem is compounded when looking at the aging organism because all of these changes can be occurring to a small degree simultaneously. thereby giving the picture of a major deficit. Enough is known about the underlying anatomy of these different systems to believe that each system acts with some independence. However. less is known about how each of these systems interacts with each other. especially in relation to age-related decline.It is clear from both clinical and experimental literature that the extrapyramidal system plays a pivotal role in motor function. This is particularly evident in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea. In addition. within the extrapyramidal system. the dopaminergic innervation from the ventral mesencephalon plays a prominent role in modulating many aspects of motor behavior. Specifically. decline of dopamine (DA) function with age is associated with a general decline in motor function. The ascending dopamine systems are associated with motor function. Of particular importance is the close proximity of the A10 or ventral tegmental area to the A8 and A9. the nigrostriatal system.

In his opinion mature central neurons were not able to regenerate new connections after axotomy:“everything may die. nothing may be regenerated”. Today we know that this view repre-sents a misleading oversimplification derived from observations with the classic silver staining methods of the regenerative responses primarily in the long. coarse and myelin-ated projection systems. such as the optic nerve or the spinal cord white matter. With the introduction of modern neuroanatomical techniques this picture has changed. We know now that many types of central neurons have a high regenerative capacity and that reformation of nerve connections-correct or incorrect ones-is possible in the CNS of adult laboratory mammals. This should change our attitudes also to CNS damage in humans: neuroplasticity must be considered as a fundamental mechanism in the post-trau-matic changes that take place after brain and spinal cord damage in patients.

During primate evolution there have been multiple waves of LINE retrotransposition as well as the birth of new mobile elements such as the SINEs Alu and SVA and we will explore what kinds of impacts these may have had on the evolving human brain.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:jM2XaDTMsSgC,9,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0409-z,13262569177317461869,/scholar?cites=13262569177317461869,,https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0409-z,0,0,0

Second. multivariate analyses were used to distinguish between: (1) sham animals — with central innervation; (2) animals with septal lesions — with central and peripheral innervation; and (3) sympathectomized septal animals — with peripheral innervation removed.

HCMV neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. A major challenge for investigating HCMV-induced abnormal brain development is the strict CMV species specificity. which prevents the use of animal models to directly study brain defects caused by HCMV. We show that infection of human-induced pluripotent-stem-cell-derived brain organoids by a “clinical-like” HCMV strain results in reduced brain organoid growth. impaired formation of cortical layers. and abnormal calcium signaling and neural network activity. Moreover. we show that the impeded brain organoid development caused by HCMV can be prevented by neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that recognize the HCMV pentamer complex.

We demonstrate that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) within the adult murine hippocampus are particularly sensitive to rAAV-induced cell death. Cell loss is dose dependent and nearly complete at experimentally relevant viral titers. rAAV-induced cell death is rapid and persistent. with loss of BrdU-labeled cells within 18 hours post-injection and no evidence of recovery of adult neurogenesis at 3 months post-injection. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive 4 weeks post-injection based on immediate early gene expression. consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of attenuating adult neurogenesis. In vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. Efficient transduction of the dentate gyrus (DG)-without ablating adult neurogenesis-can be achieved by injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3. rAAV2-retro results in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs and permits in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of dentate activity while leaving adult neurogenesis intact. These findings expand on recent reports implicating rAAV-linked toxicity in stem cells and other cell types and suggest that future work using rAAV as an experimental tool in the DG and as a gene therapy for diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) should be carefully evaluated.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:FS78WRl2AkQC,7,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.911362v1.abstract,13948878409138617235,/scholar?cites=13948878409138617235,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/19/2020.01.18.911362.full.pdf,0,0,0

When neural stem cells make the choice to become a neuron. genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulate and determine the sequence. time and ultimate success of this choice. Once a cell makes a fate choice to become a neuron. a cascade of hundreds of genes is regulated over time to lead the immature neuron into its mature. differentiated and functionally active state. Many of these neural genes are controlled by a single transcription factor. REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor. also named NRSF or neural restrictive silencing factor). which co-ordinates their expression. REST acts as a repressor of neural genes in non-neural cells. but regulation of REST can activate large networks of genes required for neural differentiation. The mechanisms of action and expression of REST have been a topic of intense investigation. and new evidence has revealed an unexpected mechanism of regulation and different actions for REST in different stem cell types at different stages of development. Ballas and Mandel review this complex literature. They provide a perspective on the current state of the field that helps to clear up some existing inconsistencies and to reveal gaps in our current knowledge that will help to focus research in the future.Just when we think we have a handle on the levels of complexity by which molecular mechanisms can regulate gene expression. new discoveries increase the possibilities.

We were equally enthusiastic about Graham Goddard’s finding that these plastic modifications can last for days or even weeks (Douglas & Goddard. 1975). There must be a mechanism in the brain that deposits our experience into a permanent store using the language of the neurons. And now we have a model: long-term potentiation (LTP)! There is a long list of arguments why the LTP model is so appealing (for a review see Teyler & DiScenna. 1987). With some minor modifications here and there it satisfies all major psychological constructs of information storage. Moreover. data or objections against its validity are virtually nonexistent. To date. an exceptionally firm consensus exists in the scientific community that LTP is one of the best candidates of a mnemonic device. But is this a scientifically valid argument? We can build memory machines with similar input-output characteristics to the brain. but these models reveal little about rules of the game in the nervous system. The ultimate validity of the LTP model therefore depends on the demonstration that conditions and changes. similar to LTP. do indeed happen in the brain. and these changes do indeed lead to storage of learned information.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:MreiaWo1ERkC,7,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=083sAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA79&dq=info:1NieNYFMtwsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=guhgzUynpC&sig=i8bpN-2hCZBtZTtvN8ef003xdqA,844227572989352148,/scholar?cites=844227572989352148,,,0,0,0

Moreover. neuropathological and neurochemical studies on autopsy material from patients with Alzheimer disease have demonstrated substantial degeneration or atrophy of the cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. including the nucleus basalis. substantia innominata. and the septal-diagonal band area (1. 20. 50. 63). This degeneration is associated with a loss of the acetylcholine synthetic enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in wide areas of the neo-and allocortex (14. 21. 51). Moreover. the magnitude of the cortical CHAT reduction. as assessed in postmortem tissue analyses. has been reported to correlate with the severity of the dementia in Alzheimer patients (51). In aged rodents as well. impairments in learning and memory have been associated with an age-dependent decline in parameters of forebrain choliner-gic transmission (24. 36. 42. 55. 58). Data have demonstrated significant shrinkage. with or without actual cell loss. in all parts of the basal forebrain cholinergic system in aged rats or mice (4. 30. 38. 44). Thus as in Alzheimertype dementia in man. it seems possible that functional deterioration of the limbic and cortical cholinergic projection systems may also contribute to the age-related cognitive impairments in rodent species. This suggestion is consis-tent with experiments in young rats showing that surgical or excitotoxic dam-age to either of the two major components of the basal forebrain cholinergic system. ie. the septohippocampal or basalocortical projections. causes se-vere impairment in a variety of learning and memory tasks (25. 37. 48. 62).

Septal lesions alone induced a sustained increased aversion to light. Fornix lesions alone had little effect on the preoperative aversion level. Fornix lesions prior to. simultaneously with. or up to 12 hr following septal lesions were successful in preventing the increase in light aversion expected after the septal lesions. Fornix lesions 24 hr or later following the septal lesions had no effect on the increased light aversion.

Cham,Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can develop following exposure to or witnessing of a (potentially) threatening event. A critical issue is to pinpoint the (neuro)biological mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to stress-related disorder such as PTSD. which develops in the minority of ~15% of individuals exposed to trauma. Over the last few years. a first wave of epigenetic studies has been performed in an attempt to identify the molecular underpinnings of the long-lasting behavioral and mental effects of trauma exposure. The potential roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in moderating or mediating the impact of severe stress and trauma are increasingly gaining attention.

Following experimental or pathologic injury of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). a complex cascade of events takes place that often results in severe anatomical and functional deficits Unlike neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or neurons of the developing CNS. the mature CNS displays a very limited capacity to extend axons and form appropriate connections. resulting in little constructive regeneration after damage.

A microfluorometric technique to measure density and intensity of varicosities and fibers,1982,Michael D Chafetz and Fred H Gage,247,Brain research,2,209-216,Elsevier,A microfluorometric (MF) technique was developed and validated as a first step in quantifying the growth of sympathohippocampal fibers. This MF technique measures independent components of areal density and fiber intensity. Areal density refers to a basic stereological measure of percentage surface or volume of fluorescent fibers. Fiber intensity refers to the amount of fluorescence (normalized for fading) emmitted by varicosities or fibers at a specific wavelength. The first phase of this research was undertaken to identify the criteria yielding the best correlations with the results of classical stereological methods. The second phase then demonstrated that the MF procedure was insensitive to shifts in the use of different criteria. Five areas of the hippocampus. and the pineal and habenula. were measured in 55 animals whose survival times after septal lesions varied widely.

Morphine analgesia is characterized by decreased responsivity to noxious stimulation without a concomitant change in sensory threshold. Thus. both of these phenomena are thought to involve neural mechanisms related to the effective component of behavioral responsivity. and the septal lesion-induced affective changes may be mediated by the endogenous opiate system. Rats given either septal or sham lesions were injected with either morphine or vehicle into either the corticomedial amygdala. posterior hypothalamus. or the ventral hippocampus. and were tested for responsivity to noxious and non-noxious stimuli.

A principal components analysis revealed two major components which accounted for a majority of the variance in all measures. One component included responses. reinforcements. efficiency. and a decrease in short-latency interresponse times; it could be viewed as supporting the previous use of the construct inhibition in the interpretation of DRL results. The other component was primarily associated with increased responding in the first period in which reinforcement was available; it could be viewed as a measure of temporal discrimination. A discriminant function. with blocks of trials as the criterion. was used to obtain from IRT/OP data a single measure summarizing change in behavior as a function of experience.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers such as the BAF complex contribute to these responses and are generally thought to activate transcription. However. the mechanisms keeping such “early activation” genes silent have been a mystery. In the course of investigating Mendelian recessive autism. we identified six families with segregating loss-of-function mutations in the neuronal BAF (nBAF) subunit ACTL6B (originally named BAF53b). Accordingly. ACTL6B was the most significantly mutated gene in the Simons Recessive Autism Cohort. At least 14 subunits of the nBAF complex are mutated in autism. collectively making it a major contributor to autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

10090672,IGF-1 instructs multipotent adult CNS neural stem cells to an oligodendroglial lineage,2005,Fred Gage and Jenny Hsieh,,,,,,Adult neural Stem cells differentiate into neurons. astrocytes. and oligodendrocytes in the mammalian CNS. but the molecular mechanisms that control their differentiation are not yet well understood. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) can promote the differentiation of cells already committed to an oligodendroglial lineage during development. However. it is unclear whether IGF-I affects multipotent neural stem cells. Here we show that IGF-I stimulates the differentiation of multipotent adult rat hippocampus-derived neural pro genitor cells into oligodendrocytes. Modeling analysis indi cates that the actions of IGF-I are instructive. Oligodendro cyte differentiation by IGF-I appears to be mediated through an inhibition of BMP signaling. Furthermore. overexpres Sion of IGF-I in the hippocampus leads to an increase in oligodendrocyte markers. These data demonstrate the exist ence of a single molecule.

We first showed that a single injection of a lentiviral vector expressing a green fluorescent protein (LV PGK-GFP) into the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the adult hippocampus enabled an efficient. robust. and long-term marking of self-renewing NSCs and their progeny. Interestingly. a subset of labeled cells showed the ability to proliferate multiple times and give rise to Sox2+ cells. clearly suggesting the ability of NSCs to self-renew for an extensive period of time (up to six months). In addition. using GFP+ cells isolated from the SGZ of mice that received a LV PGK-GFP injection three months earlier. we demonstrated that some GFP+ cells displayed the essential properties of NSCs. such as self-renewal and multipotency. Furthermore. we investigated the plasticity of NSCs in a perforant path transection. which has been shown to induce astrocyte formation in the molecular layer of the hippocampus. Our LV-mediated tracing study revealed that hippocampal NSCs are not responsible for the burst of astrocyte formation. suggesting that signals released from the injured perforant path did not influence NSC fate determination. Therefore. our studies showed that a gene delivery system using LVs is a unique method to be used for understanding the complex nature of NSCs and may have translational impact in gene therapy by efficiently targeting NSCs.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:83UE6yvegO4C,3,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2018.00415/full,10925454902130064164,/scholar?cites=10925454902130064164,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2018.00415/full,0,0,0

This distinction is important owing to the differing functional roles of TEs depending on whether they are independently transcribed. Here we report a simple strategy to examine bona fide TE expression. termed BonaFide-TEseq. This approach can be used with any template-switch based library such as Smart-seq2 or the single-cell 5′ gene expression kit from 10x. extending its utility to single-cell RNA-sequencing. This approach does not require TE-specific enrichment. enabling the simultaneous examination of TEs and protein-coding genes. We show that TEs identified through BonaFide-TEseq …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:gdpqVl03G0gC,1,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/30/11/1643.short,7966131215582258078,/scholar?cites=7966131215582258078,,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/30/11/1643.full.pdf,0,0,0

However. pedigree and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based analyses have implicated that dysfunction in some key signaling cascades might be crucial for the disease pathogenesis in a subpopulation of BD patients. We hypothesized that the behavioral abnormalities of patients and the comorbid metabolic abnormalities might share some identical molecular mechanism. Hence. we investigated the expression of insulin/synapse dually functioning genes in neurons derived from the iPSCs of BD patients and the behavioral phenotype of mice with these genes silenced in the hippocampus. By these means. we identified synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) as a candidate risk factor for behavioral …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:Fx7lCCP36QIC,1,https://www.pnas.org/content/117/8/4392.short,2945262564835163319,/scholar?cites=2945262564835163319,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/117/8/4392.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we have defined active promoters and enhancers for major cell types of the human brain. Whereas psychiatric disorders were primarily associated with regulatory regions in neurons. idiopathic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) variants were largely confined to microglia enhancers. Interactome maps connecting GWAS variants in cell type-specific enhancers to gene promoters revealed an extended microglia gene network in AD. Deletion of a microglia-specific enhancer harboring AD-risk variants ablated BIN1 expression in microglia but not in neurons or astrocytes. These findings revise and expand the genes likely to be influenced by non-coding variants in AD and suggest the probable brain cell types in which they function.Identification of cell type-specific regulatory elements in the human brain enables interpretation of non-coding GWAS risk variants.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:H-nlc5mcmJQC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/778183v1.abstract,9181491267303811327,/scholar?cites=9181491267303811327,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/22/778183.full.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore. the development of methods that produce functional human astrocytes represents an advance in the study of neurological diseases. Here we report an efficient method for inflammation-responsive astrocyte generation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells. This protocol uses an intermediate glial progenitor stage and generates functional astrocytes that show levels of glutamate uptake and calcium activation comparable with those observed in human primary astrocytes. Stimulation of stem cell-derived astrocytes with interleukin-1b or tumor necrosis factor a elicits a strong and rapid pro-inflammatory response. RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling confirmed that similar gene expression changes occurred in iPSC-derived and primary astrocytes upon stimulation with interleukin-1b.

Mobile DNA elements. historically thought of as “junk” DNA. are contributing to these changes. Competition between mobile elements and host genomes leads naturally to an evolutionary race: host genomes evolve the means to limit the spread of mobile elements. while mobile elements adapt to those and other means in order to survive in host genomes. Epigenetic modifications are a central means by which mobile element activity is contained by host genomes. In return. mobile elements can modify epigenetic mechanisms and actions. thereby leading to a feed-forward loop with different outcomes in different cells.

NY,In spite of our increased knowledge of adult neurogenesis. Cajal’s dogma of no new neurons is still fundamentally correct when viewed in the context of the brain’s intrinsic repair mechanisms. In the embryo. neurogenesis operates to generate all of the basic brain structures and circuitry. At birth. all areas of the brain down-regulate neurogenesis and. in the adult. most areas have stopped producing neurons altogether with fine tuning of the neuronal morphology and synaptic connections as the only evidence for plasticity. Evidence for persistent neurogenesis within several anatomically distinct loci in the adult brain has started to question this dogma. In spite of this evidence. the paucity of large scale neuron replacement following disease or injury leaves the dogma relatively intact.

While the molecular mechanism of disease remains unclear. insights into the disorder have been made through a vast array of experimental techniques. Together. MRI brain imaging. pharmacological and postmortem pathological studies have observed decreased brain volume. aberrant neurotransmitter signaling. reduced dendritic arborization and impaired myelination in SCZD. Genome wide association studies have identified common variants as well as rare copy number variants that contribute to SCZD. while mouse models of candidate SCZD genes show behavioral abnormalities and anatomical perturbations consistent with human disease. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) makes it possible to study SCZD using live human neurons with a genetic predisposition towards SCZD. even without knowledge of the genes interacting to produce the disease state.

The isolation and in vitro culture of NSCs provides the unique opportunity to address fundamental questions about cell proliferation. fate choice. differentiation. and synaptic maturation under experimentally defined conditions. The theoretical foundation of NSC biology rests basically on the three defining properties that a single NSC must fulfill: self-renewal. multipotency. and clonality. A popular cell culture tool. the neurosphere assay. has been used to study these key features of NSCs since 1992. Similar assays are now being used for other somatic stem cells including cancer stem cells. Recent progress in the stem cell field has been made by revisiting the neurosphere concept and demonstrating its actual potential and limits.

To study the functional role of the growth factors in vivo. genetically modified cells expressing neurotrophin have been grafted in the central nervous system (CNS) (2.3.6).

As more information is gathered. additional sites may be found that are unique to individual species (6). Although natural neurogenic processes respond in a limited manner to damage in the CNS (7–9) the inability of the adult brain to regenerate fully following disease or injury still provides a concrete example of how the dogma holds true from a clinical point of view.

In particular. intracerebral grafts of fetal tissue have been used extensively to examine biological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and functional deterioration in age-associated central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. As a result. there is now substantial evidence that intracerebral grafting may be a useful technique for re-establishing severed connections and replacing lost cells and pathways in the adult mammalian brain. resulting in functional recovery. For example. results from many studies using cholinergic fetal tissue grafted in animal models of Alzheimer's disease demonstrate that the grafts are capable of innervating host tissue and inducing behavioural restoration (Gage and Chen. 1992). Various tissue-derived factors have been proposed as mediating the anatomical and functional effects observed following fetal tissue implantation. Trophic factors produced by fetal tissue may rescue degenerating neural cells and promote other mechanisms of plasticity such as sprouting and regeneration of disrupted host neuronal circuitry. Alternatively. grafts may deliver depleted neurotransmitters following degeneration (Gage and Buzsaki. 1989; Gage and Fisher. 1991; Dunnett and Bjorklund. 1994).

More recently more detailed knowledge has emerged on the transmitter distribution (see Storm-Mathiesen 1979 for review). and based on these anatomical and histochemical findings the elctrophysiology of the cells within the HF and their connections has also been well characterized (see Anderson 1975).Understanding of the HF at the behavioral level has been pursued with equal vigor in recent decades and several general hypotheses on hippocampal function have been proposed of late. all of which concur on the importance of HF in the processing of new information during learning (O'Keefe and Nadel 1978; olton et al. 1979). Quite apart from its importance in brain function. much of the research on the HF has taken advantage of the fact that the afferent input pathways to the HF are organized to allow for selective surgical deafferentation while leaving the intrinsic anatomy essentially intact. Damage to the afferent systems of the HF results in remarkable compensatory anatomical an biochemical changes which may underlie some forms of behavioral recovery following damage.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:KVD38NuK74kC,1,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9907339579612960167&hl=en&oi=scholarr,9907339579612960167,/scholar?cites=9907339579612960167,,,0,0,0

While lithium is an effective drug for BD. 30-40% of patients fail to respond adequately to treatment. Previous work has demonstrated that lithium affects the expression of clock genes and that lithium responders (Li-R) can be distinguished from non-responders (Li-NR) by differences in circadian rhythms. However. rhythm abnormalities in BD have not been evaluated in neurons and it is unknown if neuronal rhythms differ between Li-R and Li-NR. We used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to culture neuronal precursor cells (NPC) and glutamatergic neurons from BD patients and controls. We identified strong circadian rhythms in Per2-luc expression in NPCs and neurons from controls and Li-R. NPC rhythms in Li-R had a shorter circadian period. Li-NR rhythms were low-amplitude and profoundly weakened. In NPCs and neurons. expression of PER2 was higher in both BD groups compared to controls. In neurons. PER2 protein expression was higher in BD than controls. especially in Li-NR samples. In single cells. NPC and neuron rhythms in both BD groups were desynchronized compared to controls. Lithium lengthened period in Li-R and control neurons but failed to alter rhythms in Li-NR.

Our findings provide a basis to understand genome integrity as it relates to aging and disease in the nervous system.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:f8T_-ThkUo0C,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.008490v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/03/26/2020.03.25.008490.full.pdf,0,0,0

Having previously studied the phenotype of dentate gyrus granule neurons derived from BD patients. we turned our attention to studying the phenotype of CA3 pyramidal neurons. We found that CA3 BD neurons were hyperexcitable only when derived from patients who responded to lithium. The higher amplitudes and faster kinetics of fast potassium currents correlated with this hyperexcitability. Further supporting the involvement of the fast potassium currents in this hyperexcitability and sustained activity. we observed an overexpression of Kcnc1 and Kcnc2 in hippocampal neurons derived from lithium responders. We therefore applied specific fast potassium channel blockers. which diminished the hyperexcitability. When differentiating this cohort into spinal motor neurons. we did not observe any physiological changes between BD motor neurons and control motor neurons. suggesting that the physiological alterations were neuronal type specific in BD.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:sq_mVe84DbIC,0,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02328403/document,,,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02328403/document,0,0,0

The study of risk alleles in enhancers is difficult because bioinformatic predictions of the impact of DNA alterations on function are imprecise. Further. each enhancer regulates on average 2.5 genes and because enhancers loop to regulate their target gene they can be located millions of base pairs from their target and generally they do not regulate the nearest gene. Thus. functional studies on the nearest single gene to associated markers will in most cases not accurately model genetic risk.Methods: Using our ChIP-seq data in human brain tissues. we identified SEs with genome-wide significant associated markers. We used our HiC data from hippocampus and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex to predict the target genes of the enhancers.

Enhancers can reside megabases from the gene they regulate (target gene) and their targets are often not the nearest gene. Thus. the assumption that the gene nearest a GWAS-significant marker will be the risk gene will in many cases be incorrect.Methods: To identify the target genes of enhancers with GWAS significant markers. we analyzed our Capture-HiC data selecting enhancers for functional studies using CRISPR/Cas9 in human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) derived from embryonic stem cells. The impact on expression was measured by digital droplet PCR and RNA-seq in the edited versus the mock-transfected cells.Results: We selected the super-enhancer spanning the 3’end of the RERE gene for study. the site of GWAS significant SNPs for …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:iqOphse3MeQC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9861182325608423640&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Modeling Neuropsychiatric Diseases In Vitro,2017,Fred Gage,43,Schizophrenia Bulletin,Suppl 1,S86,Oxford University Press,Overall Abstract: Cellular programming and reprogramming technology (CPART) has provided a new way to investigate human development and disease. This technology is particularly useful for diseases in which the affected tissue is not available for cell purification and where aspects of cell development are crucial for the pathology. The central nervous system (CNS) is a good example of tissue that falls into this category. Modeling human brain diseases using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or induced neural cells (iN) has remarkable potential to generate insights into understanding disease mechanisms and opening new avenues for clinical intervention. Researchers now have the opportunity to study human disease in living. developing neural cells that carry the disease-specific genetic variants that are present in the patient. In addition.

We hypothesize that proper repair of neural DSBs via C-NHEJ or other end-joining pathways is critical for neural functionality and homeostasis over time and that improper DSB repair could contribute to complex psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Here. we summarize various findings made by our laboratory and others over the years that support this hypothesis. This evidence includes. most recently. our discovery of a set of genes. of which most serve neural functions. that can serve as targets of recurrent DSBs in primary neural stem and progenitor cells.

These features allow the easy application of in vivo microscopy analysis and optical perturbation of neuronal function. So far. genetic manipulation in zebrafish has been limited to the generation of constitutive loss-of-function alleles and transgenic models. CRISPR/Cas9 offers unprecedented possibilities for genomic manipulation that can be exploited to study neuronal function.

DMD arises from mutations in the DMD gene that prevent expression of its encoded protein. Dystrophin (Burghes et al. Nature 328: 434–437. 1987). Interestingly. patients with Dmd mutations that delete certain segments of the Dystrophin coding region. but maintain protein reading frame. have a much milder form of the disease. known as Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD). This observation has spurred interest in developing “exon skipping” strategies in which certain mutation-containing or mutation-adjacent Dmd exons are intentionally removed in order to restore protein reading frame. and thereby Dystrophin expression. in DMD patients (Beroud et al.

This species has been attracting the attention of biomedical researchers and neuroscientists for its ease of handling and colony maintenance. unique behavioral characteristics. and several human-like traits. such as enriched social vocal communication and strong relationships between parents and offspring. Its high reproductive efficiency makes it particularly amenable for use in the development of transgenic and genome editing technologies in a non-human primate model. Our group has recently generated transgenic marmosets with germ line transmission. opening new avenues in primate research. In this chapter. we describe recent advances in neuroscience and disease research using common marmosets. and we outline potential uses of genome editing in non-human primates toward the …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:Lbh3VFZM3akC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=760967041495434527&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

New York. NY,Neuronal mosaicism describes the extent of intercellular genotypic diversity within a single human brain. This somatic variability is driven by numerous mechanisms including errors in DNA replication acquired throughout development and by the activity of endogenous retrotransposons. The study of retrotransposition in neuronal mosaicism may prove crucial to understanding the true complexity of normal and aberrant brain function. Specifically. numerous lines of evidence suggest that retrotransposition specific aspects of neuronal mosaicism may contribute to the unresolved etiology of many neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here. we describe the SLAV-Seq method. a recent advancement in the field over previous approaches used to study the diversity of LINE-1 based neuronal mosaicism at the single-cell level.

These inclusions are composed of once normal cellular proteins [eg. neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)] and are also generally found to contain the small heat shock protein (hsp’s) ubiquitin and hsp70. These observations suggest that hsp’s are associated with the etiology of these diseases. or that their up-regulation represents an unsuccessful attempt to remove the abnormal protein aggregates. A number of recent studies (and novel data presented in this review) have shown that the overexpression of hsp70 and/or hsp40 is neuroprotective for the polyglutamine disorders.

Such disorders are characterized by deficits in verbal communication. impaired social interaction. and limited and repetitive interests and behavior. Recent studies have led to two major hypotheses for autism pathogenesis early brain overgrowth and synaptogenesis defects. The goal of this project is to produce human cellular models of non-syndromic ASD. We used cellular reprogramming to develop iPSCs from ASD patients and non-autistic controls for the production of patient-derived neural progenitors NPCs and neurons to study cellular phenotypes that directly test whether brain overgrowth andor synaptogenesis mechanisms are found in ASD NPCs and neurons. Patient-derived NPCs and neurons from these ASD and control individuals will be used for the functional characterization of iPSCs-derived NPCs and neurons from ASD and control individuals for potential autism-specific defects in proliferation. neural development and synaptogenesis. and for gene expression studies.Descriptors:,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:r7mTg6vxT4gC,0,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1003986,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1003986.pdf,0,0,0

Since Mendel’s discovery of genetic mechanisms in the mid-19th century and the ﬁrst scientiﬁc application of these principles by Sir Archibald Garrod to human illnesses at the beginning of this century. it has become possible to understand the mechanisms by which much of human disease reﬂects errors in our genetic material. Rapidly. we are identifying important genetic components in many diseases that most investigators would not previously have labeled ‘genetic’in origin. Many of these disorders represent major illnesses of our society. including cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. most forms of human cancer. susceptibility to infections. auto-immune and degenerative diseases. and others. The major immediate effect of emerging molecular techniques has been in understanding mechanisms of pathogenesis. and in permitting more accurate and rapid diagnosis and detection of disease. Among the most stunning of all advances have been the emerging concepts of the biochemical and genetic components of normal and abnormal functions of neurological systems.

Since DS is caused by the existence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in cells. an over-dosage of genes on chromosome 21 may play a role in the pathogenesis of DS and perhaps AD as well. This idea has been well-supported in the case of the APP gene over-dosage which leads to overproduction of the neurotoxic β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. the prime culprit in AD pathogenesis. However. the involvement of other genes on chromosome 21 in AD has barely been studied.

A clear understanding of the mechanisms responsible for recovery of function will enable a rational approach to reconstruction of normal intact circuitry and function in the damaged adult brain. There are at least two general strategies for uncovering these mechanisms. One requires an understanding of the mechanism behind the recovery that can occur spontaneously. and the other explores the mechanisms of growth and functional organization during development. with the idea that knowledge of how the brain achieved appropriate functional organization initially will assist in efforts to reestablish the damaged circuits in the adult. Although much progress has been made through each approach. neither can be successful without integration of both approaches.

10090892,Nerve Growth Factor Expression and Function,2013,FH Gage and M Tuszynski and K Yoshida and G Higgins,,Growth Factors and Alzheimer’s Disease,,106,Springer Science & Business Media,Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a protein that is known to promote the survival. differentiation. and process extension of a number of neuronal systems to various degrees during development and. in some cases. in mature organisms. Deficits in the NGF responsiveness of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons may contribute to pathological changes in the aged central nervous system. One gene whose expression appears to be regulated by NGF is the amyloid protein precursor (APP). which encodes the B/A4 protein component of amyloid deposits in aged and Alzheimer’s diseased brain. In order to understand the regulation of APP gene expression by NGF in vivo. we have initiated studies in the basal forebrain of adult and aged rats using in situ hybridization and quantitative mRNA analysis of different APP transcripts. NGF receptor (NGFr) and choline acetyltransferase (Ch. AT) mRNAs. NGF or vehicle was infused into aged and young rats. In young adult rats. chronic NGF infusion produces robust increases in APP mRNA hybridization. NGFr mRNA hybridization. NGFr immunoreactivity. ChaT mRNA hybridization. and hypertrophy of Ch/\T immunoreactivity and mRNA-positive neurons. NGF treatment also increases the ratio of APP-695 mRNA to APP-751 mRNA in the basal forebrain. Control aged rats with spatial memory deficits show increased levels of APP-751 mRNA in the forebrain as compared with aged nonimpaired or young control rats. We are currently examining whether NGF treatment in aged animals can effect changes in APP gene expression associated with behavioral impairment.

To identify selective inducers of oligodendrocyte differentiation. we performed an image-based screen for myelin basic protein (MBP) expression using primary rat optic-nerve-derived progenitor cells. Here we show that among the most effective compounds identifed was benztropine. which significantly decreases clinical severity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis when administered alone or in combination with approved immunosuppressive treatments for multiple sclerosis. Evidence from a cuprizone-induced model of demyelination. in vitro and in vivo T-cell assays and EAE adoptive transfer experiments indicated that the observed efficacy of this drug results directly from an enhancement of remyelination rather than immune suppression. Pharmacological studies indicate that benztropine functions by a mechanism that involves direct antagonism of M1 and/or M3 muscarinic receptors. These studies should facilitate the development of effective new therapies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis that complement established immunosuppressive approaches.Remyelination persists throughout adulthood in the central nervous system and involves the generation of new myelinating oligodendrocytes1.

In between these two extremes are cells termed progenitor cells. which are functionally immature and retain a limited proliferative capacity (Fig. 1). Although the presence of stem and progenitor cells within the CNS is a subject of great interest and debate. they are elusive cells and have not been definitely identified by the expression of a set of phenotypic markers. like the stem cells in the hemopoeitic system. The mechanisms involved in the generation of neurons and glia from progenitor cells are difficult to ascertain. because cells move from their birth place to the sites of their terminal differentiation and because of the diversity of the cell types that make up the CNS. To address these issues it is important to understand the nature and potentiality of the progenitor cells. as well as how the cell fate is regulated within the mammalian CNS. In recent years enormous headway has been made in understanding some of the cellular and molecular strategies involved in the generation of neuronal and glial cells (Snyder 1994; Gage et al. 1995a; Kilpatrick et al. 1995; Svendsen and Rosser 1995).

Our understanding of these and other disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). immune system. hematopoietic system. etc.. has progressed greatly over the past two decades due to the development of molecular genetic techniques. These methods have allowed for the isolation. characterization. and cloning of genes relevant to certain disease states. Over the same period. developments in the delivery of foreign genes into target cells have advanced. such that a number of techniques are now available to introduce new DNA sequences efficiently into cultured eukaryotic cells. With these molecular genetic tools. enzymatic and protein deficiencies can be corrected through the introduction of normal and functioning genes via retroviral-mediated gene transfer into mutant or dysfunctional cells in culture (1-4). It has been proposed (5. 6) that corrections of disease phenotype may also be facilitated through similar methods into the entire organism. and this approach is referred to as gene therapy.

It had been a long-held belief that the birth of neuronal cells is restricted to this period and its rate tapers off in the early postnatal phase. Despite early evidence suggesting the generation of new neurons even in the adult brain (Altman and Das. 1965). the concept of adult neurogenesis—meaning the development of a mature neuron from a dividing progenitor–remained controversial for decades (Hinds. 1968; Kaplan and Hinds. 1977; Rakic. 1985. 2002). However. today there is ample and conclusive evidence from many mammalian species that NPCs persist throughout adulthood and are capable of giving rise to new neurons in two restricted areas of the adult brain: the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle (Figure 7.1)(Ming and Song. 2005). Whereas neurogenesis appears to occur in the human hippocampus (Eriksson et al.. 1998). the existence of SVZ neurogenesis in humans remains controversial (Bedard and Parent. 2004; Sanai et al.. 2004; Curtis et al.. 2007). The finding that cells with certain features of NPCs persist in the adult brain and that new neurons are continuously added throughout life sparked tremendous scientific interest in adult neurogenesis and provided fresh hope for novel therapeutic avenues treating neurological disease. Adult NPCs might be used to replenish damaged brain structures in neurodegenerative or traumatic brain injuries. either by targeted activation of endogenous NPCs or by transplantation of in vitro propagated NPCs.

How neurogenesis contributes to hippocampal function is largely unknown. Using adult mice in which hippocampal neurogenesis was ablated we found specific impairments in spatial discrimination using two behavioral assays: a spatial navigation radial arm maze task and a spatial. but non-navigable. task in the mouse touch screen. Mice with ablated neurogenesis were impaired when stimuli were presented with little spatial separation. but not when stimuli were more widely separated in space. Thus. newborn neurons may be necessary for normal pattern separation function in the DG of adult mice.The dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to contribute to spatial or episodic memory by functioning as a pattern separator (1-3). Pattern separation is the formation of distinct representations of similar inputs (4). At the cellular level. pattern separation is achieved through the dispersion of cortical inputs from the entorhinal cortex onto a greater number of dentate granule cells (DGCs) with small place fields. By virtue of low firing rates (5) and sparse connectivity between DGCs and CA3 pyramidal cells (6). DGCs are particularly adapted to maintain and transmit orthogonalized information. This ability to pattern separate. or differentially encode small or weak changes derived from increasingly similar or interfering inputs. is particularly important for the accuracy of memory encoding.

However. it is still unclear how similar human iPSCs are to human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs). Here. we describe the transcriptional profile of human iPSCs generated without viral vectors or genomic insertions. revealing that these cells are in general similar to hESCs but with significant differences. For the generation of human iPSCs without viral vectors or genomic insertions. pluripotent factors Oct4 and Nanog were cloned in episomal vectors and transfected into human fetal neural progenitor cells. The transient expression of these two factors. or from Oct4 alone. resulted in efficient generation of human iPSCs. The reprogramming strategy described here revealed a potential transcriptional signature for human iPSCs yet retaining the gene expression of donor cells in human reprogrammed cells free of viral and transgene interference. Moreover. the episomal reprogramming strategy represents a safe way to generate human iPSCs for clinical purposes and basic research.Citation: Marchetto MCN. Yeo GW. Kainohana O. Marsala M.

The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying ES cell pluripotency are. however. poorly understood. Here. we characterize a population of early mesoderm-committed (EM) progenitors that is generated from mouse ES cells by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) stimulation. We further show that EM progenitors are actively dedifferentiated to ES cells by the action of Nanog. which. in turn. is directly up-regulated in EM progenitors by the combined action of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the early mesoderm transcription factor T/Brachyury. Finally. we demonstrate that this negative feedback mechanism contributes to the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. These findings uncover specific roles of LIF.

Once considered “junk DNA” or selfish genes. these elements are now recognized as having important regulatory functions (Muotri and Gage. 2006; Muotri et al.. 2008). Long interspersed nucleotide elements-1 (LINE-1. or L1) alone comprise about 20% of the mammalian genome. although only a small portion of these retroelements are able to transpose (Muotri and Gage. 2006; Muotri et al.. 2008). When they do activate. however. these elements are able to promote not only L1 transposition. but also the transposition of other types of elements in trans (Muotri and Gage. 2006; Muotri et al.. 2008). Thus. L1 elements have the potential to mobilize large stretches of the genome and create insertions of various elements that have the potential to affect gene expression.The mobilization of L1 retrotransposons could play an important role in generating the immense diversity observed in the central nervous system (CNS)(Muotri and Gage. 2006). L1 elements mobilize in both human and mouse neuronal stem cells. but not in many other types of somatic stem cells (Muotri et al.. 2005; Garcia-Perez et al.. 2007). Several lines of transgenic mice in which L1 retrotransposition events activate a GFP transgene indicate that L1 retrotransposition is highly active during brain development. but not during the development of other tissue types (Muotri et al.. 2005). Further. the insertion of retrotransposons into the genome is not random. In mice. L1 retrotransposition events seem to occur at “hot-spots” near neuronal genes. and can alter expression of those genes (Muotri et …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:Sipo1f_CKiIC,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11810785.pdf#page=260,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11810785.pdf#page=260,0,0,0
10090922,Trophic and growth-regulating mechanisms in the central nervous,2008,FRED H GAGE and ANDERS BJORKLUND,126,Selective Neuronal Death,,143,John Wiley & Sons,In vitro studies have demonstrated the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and other neurotrophic factors in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). This paper reviews a series of experiments in which the intracerebral neural grafting technique was used to monitor the in vivo expression of such neurotrophic factors and the changes induced by denervating lesions. with the hippocampal formation as a model. Neonatal or adult sympathetic ganglionic neurons. and fetal septal cholinergic neurons. were grafted into or adjacent to the hippocampal formation in adult rats. and the effect of removal of the major afferent inputs (ie the septal. commissural or entorhinal inputs) on neuronal survival and fibre outgrowth was assessed histochemically or biochemically. Damage to the septohippocampal (partly cholinergic) pathway had a dramatic effect on survival and fibre outgrowth from neonatal and adult sympathetic ganglionic neurons. and increased the survival of both cholinergic and noncholinergic neurons in the fetal septal grafts. These effects were specific for lesions of the septohippocampal system (fimbria-fornix transection or medial septal lesions). and were not seen after transection of the entorhinal perforant path or the commissural system. It is proposed that neurotrophic factors in the hippocampal formation are under some type of regulation from the afferent inputs. and that removal of the septal afferents. in particular. will increase the availability of NGF or an NGF-like factor from the denervated target. This mechanism may play a normal role in the induction and regulation or regener-ation and compensatory collateral sprouting from the …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:IaRkJ05COeQC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=XybwY5U3T7EC&oi=fnd&pg=PA143&dq=info:ZmN1swhJ6boJ:scholar.google.com&ots=0qIaiYVjoq&sig=Ok3eJvUb09l4k8aMu0tC_TuYnf8,,,,,0,0,0

H. Song. and FH Gage occurs only in the dentate gyrus (DG). not other regions; in an older nomenclature. the DG is not even part of the hippocampus proper. Although there are reasons to subsume the DG only to the hippocampal formation and not the hippocampus. we believe that from any functional perspective this distinction is awkward. The vote has long been made by the scientiﬁc audience: We talk about adult hippocampal neurogenesis. when we mean neurogenesis in the adult DG. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis generates only one type of neuron: granule cells in the DG. To date. there is no conclusive evidence that other neuronal cell types could be generated under physiological conditions. although some as yet unconﬁrmed claims have been made (Rietze et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2003). Granule cells are the excitatory principal neurons of the DG. They receive input from the entorhinal cortex and send their axonal projection along the mossy ﬁber tract to area CA3. where they terminate in large synapse-and interneuron-rich structures. the so-called boutons. They provide excitatory input to the pyramidal cells of CA3 and neurons in the hilus regions. They ﬁre very sparsely and their activity is modulated by a large number of interneurons in the DG and hilus area. The precursor cells. from which adult neurogenesis originates. reside in a narrow band of tissue between the granule cell layer and the hilus. the so-called subgranular zone (SGZ). The term was coined by the discoverer of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Josef Altman. in 1975 (Altman 1975).

The number of newborn neurons is dynamically regulated by a variety of factors. Kainic acid-induced seizures. a rodent model of human temporal lobe epilepsy. strongly induce the proliferation of DG neurogenic progenitor cells and are also associated with long-term cognitive impairment. We show here that the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) potently blocked seizure-induced neurogenesis. an effect that appeared to be mainly mediated by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) and normalizing HDAC-dependent gene expression within the epileptic dentate area. Strikingly. the inhibition of aberrant neurogenesis protected the animals from seizure-induced cognitive impairment in a hippocampus-dependent learning task. We propose that seizure-generated granule cells have the potential to interfere with hippocampal function and contribute to cognitive impairment caused by epileptic activity within the hippocampal circuitry. Furthermore. our data indicate that the effectiveness of VPA as an antiepileptic drug may be partially explained by the HDAC-dependent inhibition of aberrant neurogenesis induced by seizure activity within the adult hippocampus.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:1In3SbHwanAC,0,https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120005716805/,,,,,0,0,0

This transplantation approach is based on the rationale that grafted DA-releasing cells will compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurotransmission caused by the degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. These early experimental findings have subsequently led to a number of clinical studies using mainly fetal mesencephalic CNS tissue as donor tissue and have produced promising results in some cases (reviewed by Björklund et al.. 2003).

Therapy for Alzheimer's disease by neprilysin gene transfer,2004,Robert A Marr and Edward Rockenstien and Mark S Kindy and Louis B Hersh and Fred H Gage and Eliezer Masliah and Inder M Verma,9,Molecular Therapy,S1,S199,Elsevier Limited,Accumulation of the amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) is believed to be a key component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Onset of the disease likely involves a disregulation of the anabolism and/or catabolism of Aβ. Endopeptidases expressed in the brain are now thought to control Aβ concentrations. Neprilysin is a metalloendopeptidase that has been shown to be a major enzyme regulating Aβ degradation. This discovery has opened the way for potentially new therapeutic strategies aimed at augmenting protease activity. For this purpose we constructed a lentiviral gene transfer vector that efficiently produces biologically active neprilysin (Lenti-Nep). and intracranially injected this vector in mouse models of amyloidosis. Previously we had shown that Lenti-Nep administration reduced amyloid deposits by half in mice with advanced amyloidosis. and ameliorated neurodegenerative alterations in the …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:afsF9h1fxg0C,0,https://search.proquest.com/openview/8f4ab97113f99a56975c7851653c68ab/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2042164,,,,,0,0,0

Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can promote the differentiation of cells already committed to an oligodendroglial lineage during development. However. it is unclear whether IGF-I affects multipotent neural progenitor cells. Here. we show that IGF-I stimulates the differentiation of multipotent adult rat hippocampus-derived neural progenitor cells into oligodendrocytes. Modeling analysis indicates that the actions of IGF-I are instructive. Oligodendrocyte differentiation by IGF-I appears to be mediated through an inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Furthermore. overexpression of IGF-I in the hippocampus leads to an increase in oligodendrocyte markers. These data demonstrate the existence of a single molecule.

It has been difficult to delineate the precise role of the scar. as it is made by several different cell types. which may limit the damage but also inhibit axonal regrowth. We show that scarring by neural stem cell–derived astrocytes is required to restrict secondary enlargement of the lesion and further axonal loss after spinal cord injury. Moreover. neural stem cell progeny exerts a neurotrophic effect required for survival of neurons adjacent to the lesion. One distinct component of the glial scar. deriving from resident neural stem cells. is required for maintaining the integrity of the injured spinal cord.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:lms347EBdh4C,0,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.854.6134&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.854.6134&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

10090956,Determining the Roles of Small Noncoding RNAs in Adult Neural Stem Cells,2004,Jenny Hsieh and Tomoko Kuwabara and Fred H Gage,,RNAi in the Brain: From Biology to Therapeutics,,19,,A central question in stem cell biology is regarding the nature of molecular determinants that control self-renewal versus lineage-specific differentiation. Unraveling the mechanisms by which neural stem cells generate neurons. astrocytes. and oligodendrocytes is important for both basic biology and therapeutic applications. Many studies of neural cell-fate determination primarily focus on the role of tissuespecific transcription factors. However. recent studies have shown that epigenetic gene regulation plays an important role in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Epigenetic mechanisms refer to effects that promote cellular specification by imposing a specific and heritable pattern of gene expression on the progeny of differentiating cells. without altering the DNA sequence. Major epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation and post-transcriptional modification of histones. such as acetylation and methylation. It is rapidly becoming apparent that another entire level of regulation exists. in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These regulators are small noncoding RNAs. acting to control the translation and degradation of many messenger RNAs. Here we discuss our own experiences in isolating small noncoding RNAs and assessing their function (s) in neural stem cell differentiation.Small regulatory RNAs. presumably due to their small size. have generally been missed in classical genetic screens. Although first noted and studied in plasmid-based systems of antisense RNAs and a few cases of noncoding regulatory RNAs encoded in the bacterial genome [reviewed in (1)]. the role of small regulatory RNAs in eukaryotic biology has …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:hTqO-V9ugBQC,0,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.620.4403&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=26,,,,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.620.4403&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=26,0,0,0

Here we describe the generation of vascularized. and electrophysiologically active. human cerebral-organoids by transplantation of organoids grown in vitro to an adult mouse brain. Engrafted mice were viable. and exhibit long and high survival rates.

10090985,1 Gene transfer and therapy in the CNS,1999,Marie-Claude Senut and Steven T Suhr and Fred H Gage,13,,,379-395,Elsevier,This chapter discusses gene transfer and therapy in the CNS. The chapter focuses on the ex vivo approach of CNS gene transfer. and will only briefly describe the current status of in vivo gene transfer technologies which are further analyzed in other chapters. In ex vivo applications. there are four primary considerations: (1) identification and manipulation of a therapeutic transgene. (2) identification of cells that can survive and retain gene expression following intracerebral transplantation. (3) Selection of suitable vectors for transferring novel transgenes into the selected cell type. and (4) intracerebral implantation of the engineered cells. The chapter provides some protocols developed in the laboratory and examines the caveats and complications that are encountered using ex vivo gene transfer.

10090989,Progenitor Cells for Therapy in the,1998,Fred H Gage,,CNS Regeneration: Basic Science and Clinical Advances,,183,Elsevier,In recent years a significant number of neurological diseases have been defined at the molecular level. Somatic gene therapy using genetically modified nonneuronal cells ex-pressing therapeutic factors have been successfully used in animal models of neurodegen-erative diseases. Ability to grow central nervous system (CNS)-derived neural progenitor cells has proven to be extremely useful to study a diverse phenomenon including the fate choice. differentiation. and synaptic maturation of cells. Immortal or perpetual cultures of neural progenitor cells implanted into the rodent brain survive. migrate. and integrate in the host cytoarchitecture. These cells can be genetically modified to express therapeutic gene products. The ability of the implanted cells to integrate in the host brain and express transgene products in situ offer potential approaches for gene therapy in certain CNS diseases. The utility of this approach has already been explored in animal models of neuro-degenerative diseases.

NJ,The combination of somatic gene transfer with cell transplantation techniques defines an intriguing new therapeutic concept for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The application of this hybrid technique is made possible by recent developments in several areas of biomedical research. Progress in molecular biology has led to the identification of an increasing number of genes involved in human disease. Developments in cell biology allow researchers to expand and engineer cells in culture more efficiently and methods of neural transplantation are being refined to achieve better graft placement and survival. The application of this so-called ex vivo gene therapy approach to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) is complicated by the anatomical and functional complexity of the brain as well as the difficulty of accessing dysfunctional areas.

10091004,CNS Regeneration and Aging,1997,Philip J Horner and Fred H Gage,,Gene Therapy for Neurological Disorders and Brain Tumors,,345,Springer Science & Business Media,Neuronal degeneration is a common feature of numerous neurological disorders and of aging. Following experimental or pathologic injury of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). a complex cascade of events takes place that often results in severe anatomical and functional deficits. Unlike neurons of the peripheral nervous sys-tem (PNS) or neurons of the developing CNS. the mature CNS displays a very limited capacity to extend axons and form appropriate connections. resulting in little constructive regeneration after damage. Studies of the developing and adult PNS have suggested that the adult CNS may be capable of achieving some degree of recovery if three critical steps are satisfied: survival or replacement of local damaged neurons. axonal growth and extension. and appropriate target innervation and functional recovery. Understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and repair of the adult mammalian CNS has been the challenging goal of decades of neuroscientific research. The efforts to understand these processes originated at the beginning of this century (1. 2). and have been revived in the past decade by several key studies that have suggested that the inability of the mature CNS to regenerate lies not in a decreased capability of adult neurons to extend new axons. but rather results from a regeneration-hostile environment characterized by the presence of glia-related inhibitors of axonal growth and a coincident deficit of tropic/trophic molecules (3–6). It is now well established that axonal regeneration and elongation can indeed take place in the adult CNS when an appropriate environment is provided (7–9 …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:-R_Z4shfoosC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=y1_0BwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA345&dq=info:v1XRXTSeqYAJ:scholar.google.com&ots=fLzexAr-7q&sig=6tJJvBoSmCljHBtimvjAiVaoQsE,,,,,0,0,0

10091013,Regeneration in the adult nervous system,1996,Fred H Gage,1,Journal of the Neurological Sciences,143,201,,There are several potential consequences of CNS damage that result in dysfunction.  First. the cells of the brain or spinal cord may degenerate and become non-functional. but survive.  In this case. the strategy is to attempt to reactivate the cells and induce their regeneration to normal targets.  This approach focuses on the delivery or reactivation of trophic or tropic factors in appropriate temporal and spatial patterns in the damaged brain.A second possibility is that neurons degenerate and die following injury.  In this case. the strategy is to attempt to replace the cells with new cells which can reestablish normal integration in the damaged brain or spinal cord.  To this end. efforts are being made to isolate and characterize stem cells from the CNS that can be induced to differentiate into defined neuronal and glia cell populations.These two strategies are not mutually exclusive. and their development will directly lead to further insights into basic mechanisms of adult nervous system plasticity.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:QaLwMs-zPFMC,0,https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-fe167566-02f0-3506-924d-c334b83fe398,,,,,0,0,0

There are two methods for performing somatic gene therapy: either genes may be transferred into cells in culture and then transplanted into an organism (ex vivo approach) or genes may be directly delivered into an organism for in situ gene transfer into cells (in vivo approach). Since techniques for directly delivering genes to cells in vivo are not yet well established. most studies that have explored somatic gene therapy have focused on ex vivo approaches. Currently. there are several clinical trials that are pursuing such a strategy. with therapy predominantly directed toward diseases resulting from either inherited genetic defects or cancer.

Primary skin fibroblasts were infected with a retroviral vector containing cDNA for mouse NGF and grafted into the adult rat striatum.  At 19 months postoperatively. rats were sacrificed and sections of the brain were processed for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.  Grafts were clearly detected in the striatum of the host brain and healthy looking fibroblasts were well lined along the long axis of the graft.  Mean number of surviving fibroblasts was calculated as 9379. which was 3.1% of cells initially grafted.  However. a riboprobe for anti-sense NGF showed no specific hybridization in the graft at this time.  NF (200 kd) immunostaining revealed many neuronal processes within the graft.  Some of them were myelinated based on observations by laser scanning confocal microscopy of sections double-stained with NF and MBP.  Denser choline acetyltransferase. NGF receptor and acetylcholine esterase-positive neuronal fibers remained within the NGF producing fibrolast graft. compared to the non-infected control graft.

MA,The degree to which damaged axons successfully regenerate in the adult mammalian nervous system differs dramatically between the peripheral and central environments. In peripheral nerves. perturbed axons can regrow past the site of damage and extend through the nerve tube to reach denervated target sites. Schwann cells appear to be the predominant reason for this robust regeneration peripherally. These cells support neurite extension of most types of neurons in vitro (Noble et al.. 1984; Fallon. 1985). since they express a varied array of surface molecules that are important for cell-cell adhesion (Seilheimer and Schachner. 1987).

It is also justified to assume that all normal and pathological functions and characteristics of the human central nervous system. ranging from relatively simple phenotypes to the most complicated of human behaviors. are certain to be as much a combination of genetic and environmental factors as are all other aspects of human biology and disorders of all other organs.

In an ideal gene therapy system. the new genetic information would be applied directly to the affected tissue. This direct approach has not yet been attempted. because the current methods of gene transfer are limited to replicating cells. Because of this and other technical limitations. approaches to gene therapy in animal models of human disease have relied on removing mitotic cells from the target tissue. genetically modifying them in culture. and then retuming the cells to the animal. Most of these studies have used genetic transducing vectors derived from murine retroviruses to introduce foreign genes (transgenes) into target cells. because retrovirus vectors offer several advantages over other current methods of gene transfer (2): 1) infection by retrovirus vectors is extremely efficient for a broad range of cell types and species. with up to 100% of the target cells expressing the transgene; 2) the viral genomes have a relatively large capacity for foreign DNA; and 3) infection generally causes little or no genetic or metabolic damage to recipient cells. Other methods of gene transfer. which utilize biochemical or physical means to introduce transgenes into cells. suffer from serious limitations in comparison. The first methods developed involve incubating cells with DNA complexed with DEAE-dextran (3) or calcium phosphate (4).

In parallel to the progress in neurobiology during the past several decades. advances in an understanding of molecular biology and the development of sophisticated molecular genetic tools have provided new insights into human disease in general. As a result. medical scientists and geneticists have developed an understanding of many human diseases at the biochemical and genetic levels. The normal and abnormal biochemical features of many human genetic diseases have become understood. the relevant genes have been isolated and characterized. and early model systems have been developed for the introduction of functional wild-type genes into mutant cells to correct a disease phenotype (34). The extension of this approach to whole animals. that is. the correction of a disease phenotype in vivo through the use of the functional gene as a pharmacologic agent. has come to be called gene therapy (10-12). Such therapy is based on the assumption that the correction of a disease phenotype can be accom-plished either by modification of the expression of a resident mutant,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:c5LcigzBm8MC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5642600775897733070&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Such a preparation has been used as a substratum for the in vitro culture of dissociated neurons. Embryonic motor neurons from chick ciliary ganglion attached to both surfaces but grew extensive neurites only on the basement membrane. On cross sections of rolled amnion membranes. regenerating axons of cultured neurons were guided along pathways of basement membrane that were immunoreactive with an antibody to laminin. In addition. when rolled amnion membranes were implanted into a lesion cavity between the rat septum and hippocampus. cholinergic neurons extended axons through the longitudinal oriented implant into the hippocampus. Thus. this amnion preparation can serve as a bridge to promote axonal regeneration in vivo in damaged adult brain.

It has been postulated that developmental neuronal survival is regulated by neuronotrophic factors (NTFs). ie. special proteins presumably supplied by the innervation territory. The available NTFs would be taken up by the innervating axonal endings and transported retrogradely in the axons to promote survival-supporting activities in the neuronal cell bodies (64). Glial cells. from both PNS and CNS developing tissues. have also been found capable of supplying such NTFs to the neurons (42. 66). Glial cells are located around the synapse. along the axons. and in close proximity to the cell body and could therefore present their NTFs to different segments of the associated nerve cells. Identification and investigation of target territory-or glia-derived factors have been made possible by the use of neuronal and glial cell cultures in vitro (65).Much of what is currently known about NTFs comes from the study of developing PNS tissues in vivo and of prenatal test neurons in vitro (65. 69). It has been attractive. however. to speculate that similar if not identical factors play corresponding roles for adult CNS neurons in vivo; and such speculations have led to a more comprehensive neuronotrophic hypothesis (2. 20. 61-63). summarized in Table 1. The hypothesis postulates that adult CNS neurons are not only regulated by CNS endogenous NTFs but are actually dependent on NTF availability.

In two neurodegenerative disease syndromes—Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases—in particular. the progressive and substantial loss of such types of neurons is likely to underlie some of the major clinical symptoms of the disease. Thus. in Parkinson’s disease the severe motor disturbances can be related to a loss of some 80%–90% of the neurons in the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. And in both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases there is a strong correlation between the degree of dementia and the loss (or possibly atrophy) of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain projection system. which is the source for the cholinergic afferents to the hippocampal formation and the neocortical mantle.

Although earlier studies achieved only limited success. the conditions for attaining reliable graft survival have been characterized and the transplantation of pieces of CNS tissue to various sites within the adult nervous system can now be achieved with a high degree of reliability. An important reason for failure in earlier studies of intracerebral CNS grafts. was because the grafts were not incorporated rapidly enough into the host blood and cerebrospinal fluid circulation. As a consequence. the transplanted tissue died from anoxia and the absence of other essential nutrients. This problem can be overcome by grafting small pieces of embryonic CNS tissue to highly-vascularized pial surfaces in the host brain (1). The necessity of a suitable pial bed for grafts in the adult host brain. however. permits only a limited number of naturally available transplantation sites. A number of techniques have been developed to overcome this limitation by the creation of artificial highly vascularized beds in other sites. However. each approach then requires transplantation of CNS tissue in a second operation once the new bed has become established (2). Nevertheless. even with such modifications. many regions of the brain remained out of reach of suitable transplantation sites. in particular in more ventral areas of the forebrain. diencephalon and mesencephalon. To overcome this limitation we have recently developed a quite different transplantation procedure. which involves the intracerebral injection of dissociated suspensions of graft tissue (3).

The electrical recordings of stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and controls were analyzed using minimum embedding dimension (MED) analysis to characterize their dynamical complexity. MED analysis revealed a significant reduction in dynamical complexity in ASD neurons during differentiation. which was correlated to bursting and spike interval measures. MED was associated with clinical endpoints. such as nonverbal intelligence. and was correlated with 53 differentially expressed genes. which were overrepresented with ASD risk genes related to neurodevelopment. cell morphology. and cell migration. Spatiotemporal analysis also showed a prenatal temporal enrichment in cortical and deep brain structures. Together. we present dynamical analysis as a paradigm that can be used to distinguish disease-associated cellular electrophysiological and transcriptional signatures. while taking into account patient variability in neuropsychiatric disorders.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:viPVbuMW504C,0,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237325571.pdf,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237325571.pdf,0,0,0

Moreover. features used by nonlinear classifiers to score sleep EEG are either not explicit or. when they are. tend to reflect a human bias which is in turn imposed on the data analysis. To resolve this issue. we have developed a reliable and unsupervised sleep scoring algorithm which clusters single channel EEG data into sleep stages following a detailed exploration of the parameter space. For any chosen set of parameters. statistical confidence in the stage separation is established with one-way multivariate ANOVAs at the cluster level and is further refined by multitaper and independent component analyses of canonical spectra for each cluster.

A group of molecular biologists who study embryogenesis in human and animal systems gathered to review and assess molecular and cellular standards for HESCs--functional assays. and important future research avenues (1). This Perspective reports the proceedings of this workshop.Our goal was to initiate a scientific discussion that may help to establish standards for evaluating HESCs. in particular. to enable the comparison and classification of existing and future cell lines. This approach also should allow a direct comparison between HESCs and their counterparts in mice and other animals that are more amenable to experimentation.

DOPAC. and DOPA accumulation after DOPA-decarboxylase inhibition. Implants of 4-9 ul of nigral cell suspension restored striatal DA levels by an average of 13-18%. with the highest individual values reaching about 50% of control. DOPAC was restored from about 5% in the lesioned controls to about 20% of normal in the grafted animals. The DOPAC: DA ratios and the DOPA accumulation measures indicated that the grafted DA neurons were spontaneously active and that the transmitter turnover rate was on the average some 50-100% higher than the intact intrinsic nigrostriatal DA neurones. These results thus provide evidence that the intrastriatal nigral suspension grafts are capable of restoring dopaminergic neurotransmission in the previously …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:DQQjGlBKAuwC,0,https://www.wnc.lu.se/sites/wnc.lu.se/files/acta_physiol_scand_suppl._522_19-28_1983.pdf,,,,https://www.wnc.lu.se/sites/wnc.lu.se/files/acta_physiol_scand_suppl._522_19-28_1983.pdf,0,0,0

Recent advances have brought us to the threshold of understanding some fundamental principles of brain function and developing treatments for some of the most devastating neurological diseases and conditions. At the same time. much of this knowledge and implications for treatments and diagnostics have social implications. Pursuing these lines of scientific inquiry in a responsible way requires that we reexamine what we do as scientists. What are the implications of what we learn about the brain for defining behavior. medical ethics and social policy? This emerging set of issues comprises a field that is coming to be known as “neuroethics.” in which scientists and ethicists are beginning to reflect on the work of neuroscience in areas such as moral vision. decision-making. conduct and policies.

Lydiane Funkelstein,,Kelly C Lee and Michael Ziegler and Fred H Gage,,,,,,This study investigated human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons for their ability to secrete neurotransmitters in an activity-dependent manner. the fundamental property required for chemical neurotransmission. Cultured hiPSC neurons showed KCl stimulation of activity-dependent secretion of catecholamines—dopamine (DA). norepinephrine (NE). and epinephrine (Epi)—and the peptide neurotransmitters dynorphin and enkephlain. hiPSC neurons express the biosynthetic enzymes for catecholamines and neuropeptides. Because altered neurotransmission contributes to schizophrenia (SZ). we compared SZ to control cultures of hiPSC neurons and found that SZ cases showed elevated levels of secreted DA. NE. and Epi. Consistent with increased catecholamines. the SZ neuronal cultures showed a higher percentage of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons. the first enzymatic step for catecholamine biosynthesis. These findings show that hiPSC neurons possess the fundamental property of activity-dependent neurotransmitter secretion and can be advantageously utilized to examine regulation of neurotransmitter release related to brain disorders.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:kFIFcbgrf0oC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/42740779/2014_Hook_Gage_Stem_Cell_Reports.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/42740779/2014_Hook_Gage_Stem_Cell_Reports.pdf,0,0,0

Therefore. the development of methods that produce functional human astrocytes represents an advance in the study of neurological diseases. Here we report an efficient method for inflammation-responsive astrocyte generation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and embryonic stem cells. This protocol uses an intermediate glial progenitor stage and generates functional astrocytes that show levels of glutamate uptake and calcium activation comparable with those observed in human primary astrocytes. Stimulation of stem cell-derived astrocytes with interleukin-1b or tumor necrosis factor a elicits a strong and rapid pro-inflammatory response. RNA-sequencing transcriptome profiling confirmed that similar gene expression changes occurred in iPSC-derived and primary astrocytes upon stimulation with interleukin-1b. This protocol represents an important tool for modeling in-a-dish neurological diseases with an inflammatory component. allowing for the investigation of the role of diseased astrocytes in neuronal degeneration.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:iHNVki4A1WcC,0,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renata_Santos9/publication/317486070_Differentiation_of_Inflammation-Responsive_Astrocytes_from_Glial_Progenitors_Generated_from_Human_Induced_Pluripotent_Stem_Cells/links/593f8c5da6fdcc1b10a6e176/Differentiation-of-Inflammation-Responsive-Astrocytes-from-Glial-Progenitors-Generated-from-Human-Induced-Pluripotent-Stem-Cells.pdf,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renata_Santos9/publication/317486070_Differentiation_of_Inflammation-Responsive_Astrocytes_from_Glial_Progenitors_Generated_from_Human_Induced_Pluripotent_Stem_Cells/links/593f8c5da6fdcc1b10a6e176/Differentiation-of-Inflammation-Responsive-Astrocytes-from-Glial-Progenitors-Generated-from-Human-Induced-Pluripotent-Stem-Cells.pdf,0,0,0

This was the 7th of a series of colloquia devoted to the neurosciences. The topics covered included pre-migratory events controlling cell proliferation. neuronal migration. early cortical plasticity including cell death and development of axonal connections. and genetic and epigenetic effects on cortical teratogenesis. It is clear that the ultimate structure and functional capacity of the cerebral cortex are determined. at least in part. by developmental events taking place very early. even before neuronal migration. Caviness and colleagues suggest that the regulation of the G. portion of the cell cycle may be an important mechanism for determining neuronal class and pre-migratory positional encoding in the …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:WxjA8IQWSGYC,0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-642-60861-2.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

10091125,RECENT ADVANCES IN NEURAL STEM CELL TECHNOLOGIES. REVIEW,,David Kaplan and Fred Gage and Ron Mc Kay and Clive Svendsen and Derek van der Kooy and Freda Miller,,,,,,Less than 10 years ago. researchers isolated the first stem-like cells from the embryonic and adult rodent brain and demonstrated that these cells differentiated into new neurons and glia in vitro (1. 2). Today. neuroscientists recognize that neural stem cells exist throughout the mammalian neuroaxis and that these stem cells continue to produce new neural cells. in certain locations. throughout an organism’s lifespan. In addition. multi-potential stem cells can be isolated from several non-neural embryonic and adult tissues. Under the proper conditions. such cells can differentiate into cell types not normally found in the tissue of origin. For instance. transplanted bone marrow stem cells can generate brain cells in vivo. while transplanted CNS stem cells can generate skeletal muscle cells and hematopoietic cells. This research has profound ramifications for treatment and repair of all tissues. including the CNS.,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:YbLjypsZzowC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16584835590129077413&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Singer and colleagues highlight recent studies that uncover 
actively “jumping genes” in developing neurons of the brain. These “jumping genes”. also referred 
to as retroelements or LINE-1 (L1) elements. are mobile elements that insert extra copies of themselves 
throughout the genome using a “copy and paste” mechanism. Although L1 sequences are highly 
abundant in the human genome most copies are retrotransposition incompetent; yet some full 
length. intact elements exist that can be active. Active L1 elements are able to influence chromosome 
integrity and gene expression upon reinsertion. Silenced in adult somatic tissues. L1 elements 
were found to be jumping in germ cells and during early embryonic development and. 
surprisingly. in developing neurons. An unexpected high number of copy number increases in 
newborn neurons suggests that many new and independent insertions can occur in each … ",True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:lg5bARUibhcC,0,https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/pdf/S0166-2236(10)00097-4.pdf,,,,,0,0,0

The utilization of cells from diabetic patients has benefit to overcome donor issue. and how naturally and safely to manipulate supplying cells reduces future risk in the long-term cure. In this study. we found that insulin is produced not only in the mammalian pancreas but also in the adult brain. Insulin expression is observed widely in hippocampal neurons. and the neurogenic factor Wnt3a is released from hippocampal astrocytes and the endocrine α cells. Our analysis further revealed that the balance between Wnt3a. which promotes the differentiation to insulin-producing cells. and IGFBP-4. which inhibits it. is regulated depending on the diabetic status. Since coordinated mechanism regulates both b-cell generation and adult neurogenesis. we took advantage to transplant adult neural stem cells (NSCs …,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:lvi_KyGYEDoC,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14772301609916033763&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

A Sox2 promoter containing 2.7 kb of proximal promoter and 0.4 kb enhancer that confers Sox2 expression in CNS (Ferri et al.. 2004; Uchikawa et al.. 2003; Zappone et al.. 2000) was cloned to drive GFP-fused CRE recombinase in Sox2+ cells (Figure 3S-A). The fidelity of the promoter and CRE recombinase was thoroughly tested.Lentivirus successfully transduced GFP expression in the mouse NSCs but not fibroblasts (FB). consistent with a specific expression of Sox2 mRNA in the NSCs (Figure 3S-B). FACS analysis further showed GFP transduction in the NSCs. although a weak GFP expression was detected in a minor population (2%) of infected fibroblasts (Figure 3S-C). CMV promoter-driven lentivirus was used to demonstrate that both NSCs and fibroblasts were subject to lentiviral transduction (Figure 3S-C). Lentivirus was also injected into the dentate gyrus of ROSA26 reporter mice to examine the specific viral transduction in Sox2+ cells and the functionality of CRE,True,eQWJIcIAAAAJ:uCYQzKCmtZwC,0,https://www.academia.edu/download/53912917/Neural_Stem_Cells_in_the_Adult_Hippocamp20170719-23475-1pim68p.pdf,,,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53912917/Neural_Stem_Cells_in_the_Adult_Hippocamp20170719-23475-1pim68p.pdf,0,0,0

A Wiley Company,General patterns of protein structural organization have emerged from studies of hundreds of structures elucidated by X‐ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Structural units are commonly identified by visual inspection of molecular models using qualitative criteria. Here. we propose an algorithm for identification of structural units by objective. quantitative criteria based on atomic interactions. The underlying physical concept is maximal interactions within each unit and minimal interaction between units (domains). In a simple harmonic approximation. interdomain dynamics is determined by the strength of the interface and the distribution of masses. The most likely domain decomposition involves units with the most correlated motion. or largest interdomain fluctuation time.

The method is based on reconstruction of the phylogenetic tree for a set of sequences and statistical analysis of the distribution of mutations in the branches of the tree. The database of homology-derived protein structures (HSSP) is used as the source of multiple sequence alignments for proteins of known three-dimensional structure. We analyse pairs of positions with correlated mutations in 67 protein families and show quantitatively that the presence of such positions is a typical feature of protein families. A significant but weak tendency is observed for correlated residue pairs to be close in the three-dimensional structure.

For each protein of known 3D structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). we provide a multiple sequence alignment of putative homologues and a sequence profile characteristic of the protein family. centered on the known structure. The list of homologues is the result of an iterative database search in SWISS-PROT using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). The database is updated frequently. The listed putative homologues are very likely to have the same 3D structure as the PDB protein to which they have been aligned. As a result. the database not only provides aligned sequence families. but also implies secondary and tertiary structures covering 33% of all sequences in SWISS-PROT.           ,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:j3f4tGmQtD8C,245,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-abstract/26/1/313/2379242,7410022756713371773,/scholar?cites=7410022756713371773,,https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/26/1/313/2379242,0,0,0

We observe a tendency for some cancers. especially of the bladder. breast. and kidney. to be depleted of mtDNA. relative to matched normal tissue. Analysis of genetic context reveals an association between incidence of several somatic alterations. including IDH1 mutations in gliomas. and mtDNA content. In some but not all cancer types. mtDNA content is correlated with the expression of respiratory genes. and anti-correlated to the expression of immune response and cell-cycle genes.

Hidden Markov models were built for a representative set of just over 1.000 structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Each CASP2 target sequence was scored against this library of HMMs. In addition. an HMM was built for each of the target sequences and all of the sequences in PDB were scored against that target model. with a good score on both methods indicating a high probability that the target sequence is homologous to the structure. The method worked well in comparison to other methods used at CASP2 for targets of moderate difficulty. where the closest structure in PDB could be aligned to the target with at least 15% residue identity.

By using evolutionary information as input to the network system. the method significantly improved on a previously published neural network prediction method that had been based on single sequence information. The input data were derived from multiple alignments for each position in a window of 13 adjacent residues: amino acid frequency. conservation weights. number of insertions and deletions. and position of the window with respect to the ends of the protein chain. Additional input was the amino acid composition and length of the whole protein. A rigorous cross-validation test on 69 proteins with experimentally determined locations of transmembrane segments yielded an overall two-state per-residue accuracy of 95%. About 94% of all segments were predicted correctly. When applied to known globular proteins as a negative control. the network system incorrectly predicted fewer than 5% of globular proteins as having transmembrane helices. The method was applied to all 269 open reading frames from the complete yeast VIII chromosome. For 59 of these. at least two transmembrane helices were predicted. Thus. the prediction is that about one-fourth of all proteins from yeast VIII contain one transmembrane helix. and some 20%. more than one.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:nnITTVbzT6kC,196,https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/1687599,17583049947863421627,/scholar?cites=17583049947863421627,,,0,0,0

Computational methods were recently used to predict deleterious effects of nonsynonymous human mutations and polymorphisms. Here we focus on understanding the amino-acid mutation spectrum of human genetic disease. We compare the disease spectrum to the spectra of mutual amino-acid mutation frequencies. non-disease polymorphisms in human genes. and substitutions fixed between species. We find that the disease spectrum correlates well with the amino-acid mutation frequencies based on the genetic code. Normalized by the mutation frequencies. the spectrum can be rationalized in terms of chemical similarities between amino acids. The disease spectrum is almost identical for membrane and non-membrane proteins. Mutations at arginine and glycine residues are together responsible for about 30% of genetic diseases. whereas random mutations at tryptophan and cysteine have the highest probability of causing disease. The overall disease spectrum mainly reflects the mutability of the genetic code. We corroborate earlier results that the probability of a nonsynonymous mutation causing a genetic disease increases monotonically with an increase in the degree of evolutionary conservation of the mutation site and a decrease in the solvent-accessibility of the site; opposite trends are observed for non-disease polymorphisms.

Recent large-scale molecular profiling has revealed distinct disease subclasses within malignant gliomas whose defining genomic features highlight dysregulated molecular networks as potential targets for therapeutic development. The “proneural” designation represents the largest and most heterogeneous of these subclasses. and includes both a large fraction of GBMs along with most of their lower-grade astrocytic and oligodendroglial counterparts. The pathogenesis of proneural gliomas has been repeatedly associated with dysregulated PDGF signaling. Nevertheless. genomic amplification or activating mutations involving the PDGF receptor (PDGFRA) characterize only a subset of proneural GBMs. while the mechanisms driving dysregulated PDGF signaling and downstream oncogenic networks in remaining tumors are unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small. noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding loosely complimentary sequences in target mRNAs. The role of miRNA biology in numerous cancer variants is well established.

The predicted contacts allow all-atom blinded 3D structure prediction at good accuracy for several known RNA structures and RNA-protein complexes.

The results of a simple reporter experiment strongly supported this hypothesis. We followed this with a genome‐wide scale analysis of a rich corpus of experiments. including RT–qPCR validation data for thousands of siRNAs. siRNA/microRNA overexpression data and mRNA stability data.

Here. using TCGA ovarian data. we surveyed the miRNAs. in the context of their predicted gene targets.   Methods and Results Integration of miRNA and gene patterns yielded evidence that proximal pairs of miRNAs are processed from polycistronic primary transcripts. and that intronic miRNAs and their host gene mRNAs derive from common transcripts. Patterns of miRNA expression revealed multiple tumor subtypes and a set of 34 miRNAs predictive of overall patient survival. In a global analysis. miRNA:mRNA pairs anti-correlated in expression across tumors showed a higher frequency of in silico predicted target sites in the mRNA 3′-untranslated region (with less frequency observed for coding sequence and 5′-untranslated regions). The miR-29 family and predicted target genes were among the most strongly anti-correlated miRNA:mRNA pairs; over-expression of miR-29a in vitro repressed several anti-correlated genes (including DNMT3A and DNMT3B) and substantially decreased ovarian cancer cell viability.

For each protein of known 3-D structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). the database has a multiple sequence alignment of all available homologues and a sequence profile characteristic of the family. The list of homologues is the result of a database search in SwissProt using a position-weighted dynamic programming method for sequence profile alignment (MaxHom). The database is updated frequently. The listed homologues are very likely to have the same 3-D structure as the PDB protein to which they have been aligned.

We performed a small interfering (si)RNA screen for novel members of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β pathway in a human keratinocyte cell line. The TGF-β pathway is integral to mammalian cell proliferation and survival. and aberrant TGF-β responses have been strongly implicated in cancer. We assayed how strongly single siRNAs targeting each of 6.000 genes affect the nuclear translocation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SMAD2 reporter fusion protein. Surprisingly. we found no novel TGF-β pathway members. but we did find dominant off-target effects. All siRNA hits. whatever their intended direct target. reduced the mRNA levels of two known upstream pathway components. the TGF-β receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2). via micro (mi)RNA-like off-target effects. The scale of these off-target effects was remarkable. with at least 1% of the sequences in the unbiased siRNA library having measurable off-target effects on one of these two genes. It seems that relatively minor reductions of message levels via off-target effects can have dominant effects on an assay. if the pathway output is very dose-sensitive to levels of particular pathway components. In search of mechanistic details. we identified multiple miRNA-like sequence characteristics that correlated with the off-target effects. Based on these results. we identified miR-20a. miR-34a and miR-373 as miRNAs that inhibit TGFBR2 expression.

Here current experimental evidence is reviewed and possible requirements for such an activity are discussed. It is proposed that one mode of chaperone action is to actively unfold misfolded or badly aggregated proteins to a conformation from whkh they could refold spontaneously; that improperly folded proteins are recognized by excessive stretches of solvent-exposed backbone. rather than by exposed hydrophobic patches; and that the molecular mechanism for unfolding is either repeated binding and dissociation (‘plucking’) or translocation of the protein backbone through a binding cleft (‘threading’). allowing the threaded chain to refold spontaneously. The observed hydrolysis of ATP would provide the energy for active unfolding.

Our findings are that there is. indeed. some valuable information available from this source and that it is sufficient to make a significant improvement in our ability to predict contacts. when compared with earlier methods that do not take into account the correlations between the mutations.

We present a novel heuristic for identifying 3-D similarities between a query structure and the database of known protein structures. Many methods for structure alignment use a bottom-up approach. identifying first local matches and then solving a combinatorial problem in building up larger clusters of matching substructures. Here. the top-down approach is to start with the global comparison and select a rough superimposition using a fast 3-D lookup of secondary structure motifs. The superimposition is then extended to an alignment of Ca atoms by an iterative dynamic programming step. An all-against-all comparison of 385 representative proteins (150.000 pair comparisons) took 1 day of computer time on a single R8000 processor. In other words. one query structure is scanned against the database in a matter of minutes. The method is rated at 90% reliability at capturing statistically significant similarities.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has provided rich molecular and genetic profiles from hundreds of primary surgical samples. These profiles confirm mutations of TP53 in ∼100% of patients and an extraordinarily complex profile of DNA copy number changes with considerable patient-to-patient diversity. This raises the joint challenge of exploiting all new available datasets and reducing their confounding complexity for the purpose of predicting clinical outcomes and identifying disease relevant pathway alterations. We therefore set out to use multi-data type genomic profiles (mRNA. DNA methylation. DNA copy-number alteration and microRNA) available from TCGA to identify prognostic signatures for the prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).   Methodology/Principal Findings We implemented a multivariate Cox Lasso model and median time-to-event prediction algorithm and applied it to two datasets integrated from the four genomic data types.

The 287 putative proteins detected to date represent about half of the estimated total number of 500 predicted for this organism. A large fraction of these (75%) can be assigned a likely function as a result of similarity searches. Several important features of the functional organization of this small genome are already apparent. Among these are (i) the expected relatively large number of enzymes involved in metabolic transport and activation. for efficient use of host cell nutrients; (ii) the presence of anabolic enzymes; (iii) the unexpected diversity of enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair: and (iv) a sizeable number of orthologues (82 so far) in Escherichia coli.

Here we show that computer-assisted amino acid analysis can fulfill this task. Amino acid analysis data can be used to compare the amino acid composition of an unknown protein with protein compositions in a database (compositional search). Routine amino acid analysis data can. despite a certain margin of error. be used to identify a protein. Compared to protein sequencing. amino analysis is much cheaper. faster. and allows higher sample throughput.

Given sufficiently large protein families. the contact predictions contain sufficient information to predict the structure of many protein families. However. since the first studies contact prediction methods have improved. Here. we ask how much the final models are improved if improved contact predictions are used. Results: In a small benchmark of 15 proteins. we show that the TM-scores of top-ranked models are improved by on average 33% using PconsFold compared with the original version of EVfold.

Consequently. they are potential targets in many different areas of pharmacological research. Unlike the class A or rhodopsin-like receptors. for which at least some structural similarity to bacteriorhodopsin has been detected. absolutely no structural information is available for the Class BG protein-coupled receptors.

To help answer this question. we have assessed the accuracy of prediction for all-helical proteins. using two conceptually different methods and two levels of description. An overall two-state single-residue accuracy of ∼80% can be obtained by a neural network. no matter whether it is trained on two states (helix and non-helix) or first trained on three states (helix. strand and loop) and then evaluated on two states.

To investigate this. we generated bigenic mice in which both activated human AKT1 and human MYC are expressed in the prostate (MPAKT/Hi-MYC model).

To address this challenge. we improved and applied the experimental-computational perturbation biology method. Using statistical inference. we build network models from high-throughput measurements of molecular and phenotypic responses to combinatorial targeted perturbations. The models are computationally executed to predict the effects of thousands of untested perturbations. In RAF-inhibitor resistant melanoma cells. we measured 143 proteomic/phenotypic entities under 89 perturbation conditions and predicted c-Myc as an effective therapeutic co-target with BRAF or MEK. Experiments using the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 affecting the level of c-Myc protein and protein kinase inhibitors targeting the ERK pathway confirmed the prediction. In conclusion. we propose an anti-cancer strategy of co-targeting a specific upstream alteration and a general downstream point of vulnerability to prevent or overcome resistance to targeted drugs.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04640.001,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:ji7lAbPyDbYC,71,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04640,8836076153380195661,/scholar?cites=8836076153380195661,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/04640.pdf,0,0,0
10091461,A human cDNA coding for the Leydig insulin-like peptide (Ley IL),1994,E Burkhardt and IM Adham and U Hobohm and D Murphy and C Sander and W Engel,94,Human genetics,1,91-94,Springer-Verlag,cDNA clones for the human Leydig insulin-like peptide (Ley I-L) have been isolated and characterized. The nucleotide sequence of the 743-bp cDNA includes an incomplete 7-bp 5′-noncoding region. an open reading frame of 393 bp. and a 343-bp 3′-noncoding region. By primer extension analysis. the transcription start site was determined as being 14-bp upstream of the translation start site. The underlying gene is expressed in the testis but not in other organs. From the cDNA sequence. it can be deduced that the Ley I-L protein is synthesized as a 131-amino-acid (aa) preproprotein and that it contains a 24-aa signal peptide. Comparison of the pro Ley I-L protein with members of the insulin-like hormone superfamily predicts that the biologically active hormone. after proteolytic processing of the C peptide. consists of a 31-aa long B chain and a 26-aa long A chain. and that it has a molecular weight of 6 …,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:l7t_Zn2s7bgC,71,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02272850.pdf,11446236945825954793,/scholar?cites=11446236945825954793,,,0,0,0

The aim of the present study was to investigate the renal expression profiles of microRNAs and their potential involvement in early diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: Diabetic models were induced with streptozotocin in DBA/2 mice. MicroRNAs were detected by microarray and subjected to bioinformatics analyses. Real-time PCR and Western blots were performed. The relationships between pathological changes and microRNA expression were evaluated by linear regression analysis. Apoptosis and proliferation of cultured mesangial cells treated with microRNA inhibitor were determined by flow cytometry and MTT assay. respectively. RESULTS: Nine microRNAs. including miR-1187. miR-320. miR-214. miR-34a. miR-762. miR-466f. miR-720. miR-744 and miR-1937b. were increased significantly.

Even without extensive refinement. application of a combination of these criteria to a test set representing all currently known protein structures yields 87% coverage with 7% false positives. compared to 53% coverage by only 1D sequence criteria.

Encouraged by successful de novo 3D structure prediction of globular and α-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments alone. we developed an approach to predict the 3D structure of TMBs.

In a blinded test for 19 TMB proteins of known structure that have a sufficient number of diverse homologous sequences available. this combined method (EVfold_bb) predicts hydrogen-bonded residue pairs between adjacent β-strands at an accuracy of ∼70%.

This phenomenon appears contradictory in that the information in the two overlaid amino acid sequences is strongly interdependent. yet each of the two proteins has evolved to its own well-defined function. The contradiction can be resolved by assuming sufficiently large degeneracy of the information contents of amino acid sequences with respect to function. Such a degeneracy is familiar from homologous proteins where a given biological function is implemented by many different amino acid sequences. It is shown that the very existence of viral overlays allows to derive a lower limit for the magnitude of this degeneracy: The degeneracy is equal to. or greater than fourfold; on the average. at each …,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:LhH-TYMQEocC,45,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01739483,12547932848596725230,/scholar?cites=12547932848596725230,,,0,0,0

This gap between the expressive capabilities and sampling practicalities of energy-based models is exemplified by the protein folding problem. since energy landscapes underlie contemporary knowledge of protein biophysics but computer simulations are challenged to fold all but the smallest proteins from first principles. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between the expressive capacity of energy functions and the practical capabilities of their simulators by using an unrolled Monte Carlo simulation as a model for data. We compose a neural energy function with a novel and efficient simulator based on Langevin dynamics to build an end-toend-differentiable model of atomic protein structure given amino acid sequence information.

Although the success rate of the initial prediction was< 40%. due to a conservative attitude towards possible over-interpretation (Venter. 1996). additional efforts to annotate the sequence follow. contributing a significant increase of functional assignments through a combination of different methods (Kyrpides et al.. 1996). In our continuing effort to annotate the gene products for each complete genome (Casari et al.. 1995). we have analyzed the full genomic sequence of M. jannaschii. and predicted gene function by sequence similarity. We use GeneQuiz. a system for large-scale sequence analysis (Scharf et al.. 1994). which exploits the combination of a number of predictive methods with a rule-based engine that increases the success of predictions thanks to a collection of heuristics and a number of benchmarking cycles (Casari et al.. 1996). We have maintained a strong interest in the study of Archaea (Ouzounis and Sander. 1992; Ouzounis et al.. 1995). and the analysis of the M. jannaschii genome was greatly anticipated. The scope of this communication is 3-fold:(i) to compare the performance of the GeneQuiz system against the laboriously derived (but highly accurate) manual annotation of the previous attempts;(ii) to discuss some of the cases where GeneQuiz has succeeded or failed;(iii) to assure potential users of the results that the quality of the analysis is high. despite the peculiar biochemical and phylogenetic disposition of this organism.

The first Pan-Cancer initiative of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has aggregated protein expression profiles for 3.467 patient samples from 11 tumor types using the antibody based reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology. The resultant proteomic data can be utilized to computationally infer protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and to study the commonalities and differences across tumor types. In this study. we compare the performance of 13 established network inference methods in their capacity to retrieve the curated Pathway Commons interactions from RPPA data. We observe that no single method has the best performance in all tumor types. but a group of six methods. including diverse techniques such as correlation. mutual information. and regression. consistently rank highly among the tested methods. We utilize the high performing methods to obtain a consensus network; and identify four robust and densely connected modules that reveal biological processes as well as suggest antibody–related technical biases. Mapping the consensus network interactions to Reactome gene lists confirms the pan-cancer importance of signal transduction pathways. innate and adaptive immune signaling. cell cycle. metabolism. and DNA repair; and also suggests several biological processes that may be specific to a subset of tumor types.

However. a major challenge is the identification of therapeutically potent microbial consortia that colonize the host effectively while maximizing immunologic outcome. Here. we propose a novel workflow to select optimal immune-inducing consortia from microbiome compositicon and immune effectors measurements. Using published and newly generated microbial and regulatory T-cell (Treg) data from germ-free mice. we estimate the contributions of twelve Clostridia strains with known immune-modulating effect to Treg induction. Combining this with a longitudinal data-constrained ecological model. we predict the ability of every attainable and ecologically stable subconsortium in promoting Treg activation and rank them by the Treg Induction Score (TrIS). Experimental validation of selected consortia indicates a strong and statistically significant correlation between predicted TrIS and measured Treg. We argue that computational indexes. such as the TrIS. are valuable tools for the systematic selection of immune-modulating bacteriotherapeutics.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:wGzT3bKASkAC,28,https://elifesciences.org/articles/30916,15898970527561941943,/scholar?cites=15898970527561941943,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/30916.pdf,0,0,0

We examine how the altered metabolism of cancer cells is reflected in the rewiring of co-expression patterns among metabolic genes. Focusing on breast and clear-cell kidney tumors. we report the existence of key metabolic genes which act as hubs of differential co-expression. showing significantly different co-regulation patterns between normal and tumor states. We compare our findings to those from classical differential expression analysis. and counterintuitively observe that the extent of a gene's differential co-expression only weakly correlates with its differential expression. suggesting that the two measures probe different features of metabolism. Focusing on this discrepancy. we use changes in co-expression patterns to highlight the apparent loss of regulation by the transcription factor HNF4A in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. despite no differential expression of HNF4A. Finally. we aggregate the results of differential co-expression analysis into a Pan-Cancer analysis across seven distinct cancer types to identify pairs of metabolic genes which may be recurrently dysregulated. Among our results is a cluster of four genes. all components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. which show significant loss of co-expression in tumor tissue. pointing to potential mitochondrial dysfunction in these tumor types.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C,27,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004176,5218590566185504037,/scholar?cites=5218590566185504037,,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004176,0,0,0

The functionality of networks with regard to performance. throughput. reliability and robustness is strongly linked to the underlying geometric and topological properties of the network and this is the focus of this paper. especially as applied to certain biological networks. The fundamental mathematical abstraction of a network as a weighted graph brings to bear the tools of graph theory--a highly developed subject of mathematical research. But more importantly. recently proposed geometric notions of curvature on very general metric measure spaces allow us to utilize a whole new set of tools and ideas that help quantify functionality and robustness of graphs. In particular. robustness is closely connected to network entropy which. in turn. is very closely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of alternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the classical Riemannian definition. each having its own advantages and disadvantages. and are relevant to networks of interest. We will concentrate on the role of curvature for certain key cancer networks in order to quantitatively indicate their apparent functional robustness relative to their normal counterparts.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:BJrgspguQaEC,22,https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04512,5854352542475348566,/scholar?cites=5854352542475348566,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04512,0,0,0

In addition. our study provides suggestive evidence of an interaction between SNPs in MRE11A and NBS1 associated with NHL risk (OR = 0.51. 95% CI: 0.34–0.77. p = 0.0002). Finally. an imputation analysis using the 1.000 Genomes Project data combined with a functional prediction analysis revealed the presence of biologically relevant variants that correlate with the observed association signals.

The quality of RPPA data may be affected by various sources of error. One of these. spatial variation. is caused by uneven exposure of different parts of an RPPA slide to the reagents used in protein detection. We present a method for the determination and correction of systematic spatial variation in RPPA slides using positive control spots printed on each slide. The method uses a simple bi-linear interpolation technique to obtain a surface representing the spatial variation occurring across the dimensions of a slide. This surface is used to calculate correction factors that can normalize the relative protein concentrations of the samples on each slide. The adoption of the method results in increased agreement between technical and biological replicates of various tumor and cell-line derived samples. Further. in data from a study of the melanoma cell-line SKMEL-133. several slides that had previously been rejected because they had a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 15%. are rescued by reduction of CV below this threshold in each case. The method is implemented in the R statistical programing language. It is compatible with MicroVigene and SuperCurve. packages commonly used in RPPA data analysis. The method is made available. along with suggestions for implementation. at http://bitbucket.org/rppa_preprocess/rppa_preprocess/src.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:JP7YXuLIOvAC,19,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097213,9189250521934727482,/scholar?cites=9189250521934727482,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097213,0,0,0

Systematic functional assays of point mutants of proteins have provided valuable empirical information. but vast regions of sequence space remain unexplored. Fortunately. the mutation-selection process of natural evolution has recorded rich information in the diversity of natural protein sequences. Here. building on probabilistic models for correlated amino-acid substitutions that have been successfully applied to determine the three-dimensional structures of proteins. we present a statistical approach for quantifying the contribution of residues and their interactions to protein function. using a statistical energy. the evolutionary Hamiltonian.

The Kinase 1 motif is borne by a loop (the P-loop). whose structure is conserved throughout the whole CMBF family. The low sequence similarity between the different members raises questions about which interactions are responsible for the active structure of the P-loop.

Since the space of all possible genetic variation is enormous. there is a concerted effort to develop reliable methods that can capture genotype to phenotype maps. State-of-art computational methods rely on models that leverage evolutionary information and capture complex interactions between residues. However. current methods are not suitable for a large number of important applications because they depend on robust protein or RNA alignments. Such applications include genetic variants with insertions and deletions. disordered proteins. and functional antibodies. Ideally. we need models that do not rely on assumptions made by multiple sequence alignments. Here we borrow from recent advances in natural language processing and speech synthesis to develop a generative deep neural network-powered autoregressive model for biological sequences that captures functional constraints without relying on an explicit alignment structure. Application to unseen experimental measurements of 42 deep mutational scans predicts the effect of insertions and deletions while matching state-of-art missense mutation prediction accuracies.

The functionality of networks with regard to performance. throughput. reliability and robustness is strongly linked to the underlying geometric and topological properties of the network and this is the focus of this paper. especially as applied to certain biological networks. The fundamental mathematical abstraction of a network as a weighted graph brings to bear the tools of graph theory–a highly developed subject of mathematical research. But more importantly. recently proposed geometric notions of curvature on very general metric measure spaces allow us to utilize a whole new set of tools and ideas that help quantify functionality and robustness of graphs. In particular. robustness is closely connected to network entropy which. in turn. is very closely related to curvature. We will see that there are a number of alternative notions of discrete curvature that are compatible with the classical Riemannian definition. each having its own advantages and disadvantages. and are relevant to networks of interest.

10091574,1D secondary structure prediction through evolutionary profiles,1994,Burkhard Rost and Chris Sander,,Protein Structure by Distance Analysis,,257-276,IOS Press. Amsterdam. Oxford. Washington,For only about one third of the new proteins. 3D structure can be predicted. For the remaining two thirds. a compromise has to be made. An extreme simplification is the projection of 3D structure onto a string of ID secondary structure assignments. Here. we report how neural networks can be configured such that strand is predicted significantly better. and that the prediction looks like native proteins in terms of the length of predicted segments. Using evolutionary information contained in multiple sequence alignments as input to neural networks. secondary structure can be predicted at significantly increased accuracy. Preprocessing the alignment information by using a position-specific conservation weight and the number of insertions and deletions in each alignment position is found to be advantageous. Addition of the global amino acid content yields a further improvement. mainly in predicting structural class. The final network system has a sustained overall accuracy of more than 72% evaluated on 250 sequence-unique chains. Of particular practical importance is the definition of a position-specific reliability index. For 40% of all residues the method has a sustained three-state accuracy of 88%. as high as the overall average for homology modelling.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:35r97b3x0nAC,14,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=LKxFL1ksNH8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA257&dq=info:Q5QFr-We6OcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=gg3RSybTBa&sig=a2_OiLRpqvt8IfKJCjsiRblM_GM,16710781126679303235,/scholar?cites=16710781126679303235,,https://cbio.mskcc.org/publications/papers/sander/099.pdf,0,0,0

However. the infiltration level of distinct T cell subsets and the signals that draw them into a tumor. such as the expression of antigen presenting machinery (APM) genes. remain poorly characterized across human cancers. Here. we define a novel mRNA-based T cell infiltration score (TIS) and profile infiltration levels in 19 tumor types. We find that clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the highest for TIS and among the highest for the correlation between TIS and APM expression. despite a modest mutation burden. This finding is contrary to the expectation that immune infiltration and mutation burden are linked. To further characterize the immune infiltration in ccRCC. we use RNA-seq data to computationally infer the infiltration levels of 24 immune cell types in a discovery cohort of 415 ccRCC patients and validate our findings in an independent cohort of 101 ccRCC patients. We find three clusters of tumors that are primarily separated by levels of T cell infiltration and APM gene expression. In ccRCC. the levels of Th17 cells and the ratio of CD8+ T/Treg levels are associated with improved survival whereas the levels of Th2 cells and Tregs are associated with negative …,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:iyewoVqAXLQC,13,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/025908v1.abstract,6068566281389001022,/scholar?cites=6068566281389001022,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/09/01/025908.full.pdf,0,0,0

Boston. MA,The development of plants is regulated by five types of hormones known as auxins. cytokinins. gibberellins. abscisic acid and ethylene (Phillips. 1971). Only little is known about the mechanisms of action of these hormones at the cellular and molecular level. Genetic analysis of mutants with increased resistance to growth inhibiting concentrations of hormones argues for the presence of receptor like functions in plants (King. 1988). Biochemical evidence suggests that the action of auxins may be mediated after binding to plasmalemma located receptors (for review see: Davies. 1988). However. our current picture on other elements in the plant cell. involved in the transmission of this signal to its final biological target. is only slowly emerging. Recent evidence strengthens the importance of the calcium signal in plant cells (Marme. 1983; Hepler & Wayne. 1985).

ATPase RapA is a bacterial homolog of the SWI/SNF protein family. Eukaryotic representatives of this family have been implicated in chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression.

In a first pan-cancer application. we have compared 260 cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) and 1914 tumors of six different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). using weights to emphasize genomic alterations that frequently recur in tumors. We report the potential suitability of particular cell lines as tumor models and identify apparently unsuitable outlier cell lines. some of which are in wide use. for each of the six cancer types. In future. this weighted similarity method may be generalized for use in a clinical setting to compare patient profiles consisting of genomic patterns combined with clinical attributes. such as diagnosis. treatment and response to therapy.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:R-LXmdHK_14C,7,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/028159v1.abstract,12932512960346389025,/scholar?cites=12932512960346389025,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2015/10/02/028159.full.pdf,0,0,0

Cancer drugs targeting these alterations often work initially. but resistance is common. Combinations of targeted drugs may overcome or prevent resistance. but their selection requires context-specific knowledge of signaling pathways including complex interactions such as feedback loops and crosstalk. To infer quantitative pathway models. we collected a rich dataset on a melanoma cell line: Following perturbation with 54 drug combinations. we measured 124 (phospho-)protein levels and phenotypic response (cell growth. apoptosis) in a time series from 10 minutes to 67 hours. From these data. we trained time-resolved mathematical models that capture molecular interactions and the coupling of molecular levels to cellular phenotype. which in turn reveal the main direct or indirect molecular responses to each drug. Systematic model simulations identified novel combinations of drugs predicted to reduce the survival of melanoma cells. with partial experimental verification.

MA,Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is a prerequisite for the rational design of site-directed mutations in a protein and can be of great importance for the design of drugs. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are the only ways to obtain such detailed structural information. Unfortunately. these techniques involve elaborate technical procedures and many proteins fail to crystallize at all [Giege 89] and/or cannot be obtained or dissolved in large enough quantities for NMR measurements. The size of the protein is also a limiting factor for NMR. In the absence of experimental data. model-building on the basis of the known three dimensional structure of a homologous protein is at present the only reliable method to obtain structural information [Swindells et al 91].

In a more limited number of cases. and for small proteins only. we also have nearly full coverage of all possible double mutants. By comparing the phenotypic effect of two simultaneous mutations with that of the individual amino acid changes. we can evaluate epistatic effects that reflect non-additive cooperative processes. The observation that epistatic residue pairs often are in contact in the 3D structure led to the hypothesis that a systematic epistatic screen contains sufficient information to identify the 3D fold of a protein. To test this hypothesis. we examined experimental double mutants for evidence of epistasis and identified residue contacts at 86% accuracy. including secondary structure elements and evidence for an alternative all-α-helical conformation. Positively epistatic contacts – corresponding to compensatory mutations. restoring fitness – were the most informative. Folded models generated from top-ranked epistatic pairs. when compared with the known structure. were accurate within 2.4 Å over 53 residues. indicating the possibility that 3D protein folds can be determined experimentally with good accuracy from functional assays of mutant libraries. at least for small proteins.

Residues in spatial proximity tend to co-evolve. yet attempts to invert the evolutionary record to identify these constraints and use them to computationally fold proteins have so far been unsuccessful. Here. we show that co-variation of residue pairs. observed in a large protein family. provides sufficient information to determine 3D protein structure. Using a data-constrained maximum entropy model of the multiple sequence alignment. we identify pairs of statistically coupled residue positions which are expected to be close in the protein fold. termed contacts inferred from evolutionary information (EICs). To assess the amount of information about the protein fold contained in these coupled pairs. we evaluate the accuracy of predicted 3D structures for proteins of 50-260 residues. from 15 diverse protein families. including a G-protein coupled receptor. These structure predictions are de novo. ie. they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The resulting low C {\alpha}-RMSD error range of 2.7-5.1 Å. over at least 75% of the protein. indicates the potential for predicting essentially correct 3D structures for the thousands of protein families that have no known structure. provided they include a sufficiently large number of divergent sample sequences.

Models that generalize well beyond training data can be used to identify combinatorial perturbations of potential therapeutic interest. Major challenges for machine learning on large biological datasets are to find global optima in an enormously complex multi-dimensional solution space and to mechanistically interpret the solutions.

Methods: A prospective database identified 57 consecutive patients with localized primary MRLS of the extremity treated between 1982 and 2003. Histology was reviewed for percent of necrosis and RC component. Microarray data from 6 tumors was analyzed using hierarchical and supervised clustering. A t-test was performed. using a false discovery rate of <0.05. to determine genes associated with necrosis. Results: Median age was 46 years (23–76) and median tumor size was 12 cm (1.7–38).

Here. we demonstrate that BET inhibition induces a multi-faceted adaptive response program leading to MCL1 protein-driven evasion of apoptosis in breast cancers. Consequently. co-targeting MCL1 and BET is highly synergistic in in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Drug response and genomics analyses revealed that MCL1 copy number alterations. including low-level gains. are selectively enriched in basal-like breast cancers and associated with effective BET and MCL1 co-targeting. The mechanism of adaptive response to BET inhibition involves upregulation of critical lipid metabolism enzymes including the rate-limiting enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Changes in the lipid metabolism are associated with increases in cell motility and membrane fluidity as well as transitions in cell morphology and adhesion. The structural changes in the cell membrane leads to re-localization and activation of HER2/EGFR which can be interdicted by inhibiting SCD activity. Active HER2/EGFR. in turn. induces accumulation of MCL1 protein and therapeutic vulnerability to MCL1 inhibitors. The BET protein. lipid metabolism and receptor tyrosine kinase activation cascade is observed in patient cohorts of basal-like and HER2-amplified breast cancers. The high frequency of MCL1 chromosomal amplifications (>30%) and gains (>50%) in basal-like breast cancers suggests that BET and MCL1 co-inhibition may have therapeutic utility in this aggressive subtype.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:w-fwKiQwpQAC,1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/711895v2.abstract,14202874586209229414,/scholar?cites=14202874586209229414,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/07/23/711895.full.pdf,0,0,0

In fact. the majority of the eukaryotic genome does not code for proteins. and thousands of conserved long non-protein-coding RNAs of currently unkown function have been identified. When available. knowledge of their 3D structure is very helpful in elucidating the function of these RNAs. However. despite some outstanding structure elucidation of RNAs using X-ray crystallography. NMR and cryoEM. learning RNA 3D structures remains low-throughput. RNA structure prediction in silico is a promising alternative approach and works well for double-helical stems. but full 3D structure determination requires tertiary contacts outside of secondary structures that are difficult to infer from sequence information. Here. based only on information from RNA multiple sequence alignments. we use a global statistical sequence probability model of co-variation in a pairs of nucleotide positions to detect 3D contacts. in analogy to recently developed breakthrough methods for computational protein folding. In blinded tests on 22 known RNA structures ranging in size from 65 to 1800 nucleotides. the predicted contacts matched physical nucleotide interactions with 65-95% true positive prediction accuracy. Importantly. we infer many long-range tertiary contacts. including non-Watson-Crick interactions. where secondary structure elements assemble in 3D.

10091648,Accurate prediction of transmembrane β-barrel proteins from sequences,2014,Sikander Hayat and Chris Sander and Arne Elofsson and Debora S Marks,,bioRxiv,,006577,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Transmembrane β-barrels are known to play major roles in substrate transport and protein biogenesis in gram-negative bacteria. chloroplasts and mitochondria. However. the exact number of transmembrane β-barrel families is unknown and experimental structure determination is challenging. In theory. if one knows the number of strands in the β-barrel. then the 3D structure of the barrel could be trivial. but current topology predictions do not predict accurate structures and are unable to give information beyond the β-strands in the barrel. Recent work has shown successful prediction of globular and alpha-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments. by using high ranked evolutionary couplings between residues as distance constraints to fold extended polypeptides. However. these methods. have not addressed the calculation of precise β-sheet hydrogen bonding that defines transmembrane β-barrels. and would be required to fold these proteins successfully. Hence we developed a method (EVFold_BB) that can successfully model transmembrane β-barrels by combining evolutionary couplings together with topology predictions. EVFold_BB is validated by the accurate all-atom 3D modeling of 18 proteins. representing all known membrane β-barrel families that have sufficient sequences available. To demonstrate the potential of our approach we predict the unknown 3D structure of the LptD protein. the plausibility of its accuracy is supported by the blindly predicted benchmarks. and is consistent with experimental observations.

H. Bohr and S. Brunak, eds. CRC Press, London",,124-131,,Multiple sequences in a protein family reflect the history of the evolutionary process of mutations and selection. This process causes functionally important residues to be conserved while other residues can vary in residue type. However. members of most protein families share only some aspects of their function and do not all have identical constraints on sequence. This diversity makes it nontrivial to identify those key positions in the family. Here. we describe a method that can detect and exploit such subtle patterns of conservation for the prediction of functional residues. In its algorithmic nature it is a distance geometry method applied to sequences in an abstract high dimensional sequence space. The quality of derived predictions is demonstrated with examples.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:L7CI7m0gUJcC,1,http://cbio.mskcc.org/publications/papers/sander/139.pdf,5445816485232275211,/scholar?cites=5445816485232275211,,http://cbio.mskcc.org/publications/papers/sander/139.pdf,0,0,0

Berlin,Over the course of many millions of years nature has evolved highly intricate and useful proteins. gradually optimizing protein function in response to selective pressure. When will humans be able to sidestep evolution and design novel proteins with desired structures and functions? Will the new proteins be redesigns of natural proteins or de novo inventions with sequences not found in nature? The answers to these questions are not yet in. but the first steps have been taken. Reengineering work has shown that the protein engineer has considerable latitude in modifying existing frameworks. not just by replacing active site residues. but also in rearranging loop regions. The rules of de novo design are partly understood for simple structures such as four-helix bundles and the first stable protéines have been designed de novo.

We developed the netboxr package written in the R programming language. which makes use of the NetBox algorithm to identify candidate cancer-related functional modules. The algorithm makes use of a data-driven. network-based approach that combines prior knowledge with a network clustering algorithm. obviating the need for and the limitation of independently curated functionally labeled gene sets. The method can combine multiple data types. such as mutations and copy number alterations. leading to more reliable identification of functional modules.

Traditionally. biological knowledge is captured in publications and knowledge bases. Knowledge in papers is not directly in a computable. structured form; curated structured knowledge bases are limited by manual curation processes. To accelerate knowledge capture and communication and keep pace with the rapid growth of scientific reports. we developed the Biofactoid (biofactoid. org) software suite. Biofactoid accelerates the transfer of knowledge from the minds of authors into computable. widely shared. structured knowledge and can be used as part of the standard publication process. Biofactoid is a web-based system for scientists to compose a structured representation of networks of interactions between genes. their products. and chemical compounds. represented using the expressive power of a formal ontology (BioPAX). The resulting knowledge items are shared via public information resources and can be discovered and analyzed in the context of all existing computable knowledge.

The total cross section integrated across the fiducial range is 1.59 ± 0.13 mb. Cross sections are also measured differentially as functions of ξ. t. and ∆η. a variable that characterises the rapidity gap separating the proton and the system X . The data are consistent with an exponential t dependence. dσ/dt ∝ eBt with slope parameter B = 7.65 ± 0.34 GeV−2.

Here. as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium. which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumour types. we describe DriverPower. a software package that uses mutational burden and functional impact evidence to identify driver mutations in coding and non-coding sites within cancer whole genomes. Using a total of 1373 genomic features derived from public sources. DriverPower’s background mutation model explains up to 93% of the regional variance in the mutation rate across multiple tumour types. By incorporating functional impact scores. we are able to further increase the accuracy of driver discovery. Testing across a collection of 2583 cancer genomes from the PCAWG project. DriverPower identifies 217 coding and 95 non-coding driver candidates. Comparing to six published methods used by the PCAWG Drivers and Functional Interpretation Working Group. DriverPower has the highest F1 score for both coding and non-coding driver discovery. This demonstrates that DriverPower is an effective framework for computational driver discovery.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:gYnLYBw1zZMC,0,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/317149,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/317149/41467_2019_13929_MOESM2_ESM.pdf?sequence=6,0,0,0

Combination therapies that target co-activated oncogenic processes can induce stronger and more durable responses compared to mono-therapies. Here. we developed REFLECT (REcurrent Features Leveraged for Combination Therapies) to match precision combination therapies to co-alteration signatures that are recurrent within patient cohorts. Using REFLECT. we generated a comprehensive resource mapping the actionable co-alteration signatures at DNA. mRNA and protein levels across more than 10.000 cancer patients and 199 cohorts. The patient cohorts are generated by stratifying the patient meta-cohort based on the existence of key oncogenic alterations. In the cohort of patients carrying potential immunotherapy markers. we identified distinct patient sub-cohorts that are enriched by actionable DNA repair aberrations. inflammation markers and B-cell presence. Through REFLECT analysis and validations in molecularly matched cell lines. we nominated HER2 and Aurora kinase inhibitors as effective in patients with AURKA mutations and HER2 activation. The analyses of DNA repair aberrations combined with validation experiments have identified recurrent molecular signatures that match effective combinations involving PARP. AKT. MET and other DNA repair pathway inhibitors. We expect REFLECT will facilitate the selection of effective combination therapies and benefiting patient cohorts matched to aberration signatures in preclinical and data-driven clinical trials.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:qQc65DSaYXMC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.132514v1.abstract,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/08/17/2020.06.03.132514.full.pdf,0,0,0

Resistance to targeted therapies. either intrinsic (pre-existing at the time of treatment) or acquired (emerges as the tumor adapts to therapy). is a major challenge in oncology. Blocking multiple escape routes using drug combinations is the best solution to drug resistance. However. the discovery of effective combinations remains a challenging task due to complexity of the underlying biological processes and inter-tumor heterogeneity. Here. we developed a statistical pathway analysis method that (i) reveals pathways involved in drug activity and adaptive resistance and (ii) nominates combination therapies to down-regulate the resistance pathways. The method is based on the rationale that (i) targeting a specific genomic aberration may lead to activation of compensatory pathways (e.g. via feedback loops in the short term) and subsequent resistance. and (ii) collective changes in pathway activities are …,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:puFLaqDw8dcC,0,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/79/13_Supplement/3820.short,,,,,0,0,0

An emerging hybrid strategy for modeling protein structures combines sparse NMR data that can be obtained for larger proteins with sequence co-variation data. called evolutionary couplings (ECs). obtained from multiple sequence alignments of protein families. This hybrid “EC-NMR” method can be used to accurately model larger (15–60 kDa) proteins. and more rapidly determine structures of smaller (5–15 kDa) proteins using only backbone NMR data. The resulting structures have accuracies relative to reference structures comparable to those obtained with full backbone and sidechain NMR resonance assignments. The requirement that evolutionary couplings (ECs) are consistent with NMR data recorded on a specific member of a protein family. under specific conditions. potentially also allows identification of ECs that reflect alternative allosteric or excited states of the protein structure.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:P-MJmu9ZMwQC,0,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=cueCDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA153&dq=info:siBPf4YDkLcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=aVEF10LqAI&sig=trscyh9UpnGwkYe0RrhwazCITgw,,,,,0,0,0

Existing methods can identify highly recurrent individual mutations or mutated genes. but capturing functional yet infrequent “long-tail” mutations remains challenging. While individually uncommon. these long-tail mutations are present in as many as one-third of cancer patients. and for many of them targeted therapies currently exist. Therefore. improved approaches to identify individual driver mutations in the long tail will facilitate our understanding of their potentially diverse biological and clinical significance.

However. rare functional mutations can escape detection by recurrence analysis for lack of statistical power. We address this problem by extending the notion of recurrence of mutations from single genes to gene families that share homologous protein domains. In addition to lowering the threshold of detection. this sharpens the functional interpretation of the impact of mutations. as protein domains more succinctly embody function than entire genes. Mapping mutations in 22 different tumor types to equivalent positions in multiple sequence alignments of protein domains. we confirm well-known functional mutation hotspots and make two types of discoveries: 1) identification and functional interpretation of uncharacterized rare variants in one gene that are equivalent to well-characterized mutations in canonical cancer genes. such as uncharacterized ERBB4 (S303F) mutations that are analogous to canonical ERRB2 (S310F) mutations in the furin-like domain. and 2) detection of previously unknown mutation hotspots with novel functional implications.

EMBL Meyerhofstrasse,2013,L Holm and B Rost and C Sander and R Schneider and G Vriend,325,"Statistical Mechanics, Protein Structure, and Protein Substrate Interactions",,277,Springer Science & Business Media,Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure is a prerequisite for the rational design of site-directed mutations in a protein and can be of great importance for the design of drugs. X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy are the only ways to obtain such detailed structural information. Unfortunately. these techniques involve elaborate technical procedures and many proteins fail to crystallize at all [Giege 89] and/or cannot be obtained or dissolved in large enough quantities for NMR measurements. The size of the protein is also a limiting factor for NMR. In the absence of experimental data. model-building on the basis of the known three dimensional structure of a homologous protein is at present the only reliable method to obtain structural information [Swindells et al 91]. Comparisons of the tertiary structures of homologous proteins have shown that three-dimensional structures have been better conserved in evolution than protein primary structures [Bajai et al 87; Bashford et al 87; Vriend & Sander 91; Holm et al 92]. indicating the feasibility of modelbuilding by homology.In the absence of a structure with sufficient homology to the protein of interest. Secondary structure prediction can provide important structural information. All structure prediction techniques depend in one way or another on experimental data.

Although anticancer drug treatment may initially kill tumor cells. the cells often acquire resistance to the drug and resume proliferation. One way to reduce the likelihood of resistance and increase drug efficacy is to simultaneously treat tumors with two or more drugs that target different cellular proteins. Miller et al. found that simultaneous inhibition of CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase 4) and IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) synergistically inhibited proliferation of two patient-derived dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines. Liposarcomas are tumors that develop from fat cells. and dedifferentiated liposarcoma is a subtype that is particularly aggressive and difficult to treat.

In various contexts. these substructures are thought to fold autonomously. to carry specific molecular functions such as binding or catalysis. to move relative to each other as semi-rigid bodies and to speed the evolution of new functions by recombination (Fig. 23.1. 2.1). The problem of subdividing protein molecules into structural and functional units has received the attention of numerous researchers over the last 25 years. Early algorithms focused on protein folding or unfolding pathways and aimed at identifying substructures that would be physically stable on their own.

10091754,3-D lookup: Fast protein structure database searches,1995,L Holm and C Sander,,,CONF-9507246-,,Stanford Univ.. CA (United States),There are far fewer classes of three-dimensional protein folds than sequence families but the problem of detecting three-dimensional similarities is NP-complete. We present a novel heuristic for identifying 3-D similarities between a query structure and the database of known protein structures. Many methods for structure alignment use a bottom-up approach. identifying first local matches and then solving a combinatorial problem in building up larger clusters of matching substructures. Here the top-down approach is to start with the global comparison and select a rough superimposition using a fast 3-D lookup of secondary structure motifs. The superimposition is then extended to an alignment of C {sup {alpha}} atoms by an iterative dynamic programming step. An all-against-all comparison of 385-representative proteins (150.000 pair comparisons) took 1 day of computer time on a single R8000 processor. In other words. one query structure is scanned against the database in a matter of minutes. The method is rated at 90% reliability at capturing statistically significant similarities. It is useful as a rapid preprocessor to a comprehensive protein structure database search system.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:4aZ_i-5WJEQC,0,https://www.osti.gov/biblio/401844,,,,,0,0,0

A large fraction of these (75%) can be assigned a likely function as a result of similarity searches. Several important features of the functional organization of this small genome are already apparent. Among these are (i) the expected relatively large number of enzymes involved in metabolic transport and activation. for efficient use of host cell nutrients;(li) the presence of anabolic enzymes;(iii) the unexpected diversity of enzymes involved in DNA replication and repair; and (iv) a sizeable number of orthologues (82 so far) in,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:YlPif8NxrbYC,0,http://cbio.mskcc.org/publications/papers/sander/143.pdf,,,,http://cbio.mskcc.org/publications/papers/sander/143.pdf,0,0,0

Bairoch. pers. communication). and then describe the complementary nature of the work of the two groups. Early in 1992. we undertook the task of analyzing the recently sequenced chromosome III ORFs from yeast [Oliver. SG et al.. Nature 357. 38461. Apart from verifying the initial results. we were able to identify 17 more ORFs with homology to proteins of known function [Bork. P. et al.. Nature 358. 2871. The complete work was published with some delay (Bork. P et al.. Protein Sci. 1. 1677-16901. The identification of a gene with strong similarity to NitS from nitrogen-fixing bacteria came as a surprise (see also Science 256. 730). We felt that we should investigate the matter further. and our analysis showed that NifS is homologous to various pyridoxal-S-phosphate-dependent enzymes. This result was obtained in the summer of 1992. and the manuscript was written before the end of that year. When the Mehta and Christen paper appeared early in 1993 [Mehta. PK and Christen. P.. Eur.

For example. prediction of secondary structure has now been advanced to the 70% three-state accuracy level using a neural network algorithm with multiple related sequences as input [1]. In another example. structure comparison of actin with its distant evolutionary cousins led to a database search pattern that identified a new class of bacterial ATPases. probably ancient relatives of actin [2].

10091777,Precision combination therapies from recurrent oncogenic co-alterations,,Augustin Luna Elnaggar and Chris Sander and Anil Korkut,,,,,,Cancer cells rely on co-activation of oncogenic processes that are driven by co-occurring molecular aberrations. Combination therapies that target co-activated oncogenic processes can induce stronger and more durable responses compared to mono-therapies. Here. we developed REFLECT (REcurrent Features Leveraged for Combination Therapies) to match precision combination therapies to co-alteration signatures that are recurrent within patient cohorts. Using REFLECT. we generated a comprehensive resource mapping the actionable co-alteration signatures at DNA. mRNA and protein levels across more than 10.000 cancer patients and 199 cohorts. The patient cohorts are generated by stratifying the patient meta-cohort based on the existence of key oncogenic alterations. In the cohort of patients carrying potential immunotherapy markers. we identified distinct patient sub-cohorts that are enriched by actionable DNA repair aberrations. inflammation markers and B-cell presence. Through REFLECT analysis and validations in molecularly matched cell lines. we nominated HER2 and Aurora kinase inhibitors as effective in patients with AURKA mutations and HER2 activation. The analyses of DNA repair aberrations combined with validation experiments have identified recurrent molecular signatures that match effective combinations involving PARP. AKT. MET and other DNA repair pathway inhibitors. We expect REFLECT will facilitate the selection of effective combination therapies and benefiting patient cohorts matched to aberration signatures in preclinical and data-driven clinical trials.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:w_ORaKkuc5QC,0,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.132514v1.full.pdf,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.132514v1.full.pdf,0,0,0

Here. we demonstrate that cellular stress engendered by BET inhibition induces an adaptive response leading to MCL1 protein-driven evasion of apoptosis in breast cancers. Consequently. co-targeting MCL1 and BET is highly synergistic in in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. The mechanism of adaptive response to BET inhibition involves upregulation of critical lipid metabolism enzymes including the rate-limiting enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). Changes in the lipid metabolism are associated with increases in cell motility and membrane fluidity as well as transitions in cell morphology. The structural changes in the cell membrane leads to re-localization and activation of HER2/EGFR which can be interdicted by inhibiting SCD activity. Active HER2/EGFR. in turn. induces accumulation of MCL1 protein and therapeutic vulnerability to MCL1 inhibitors. The BET protein. lipid metabolism and receptor tyrosine kinase activation cascade is observed in patient cohorts of basal-like and HER2-amplified breast cancers. Drug response and genomics analyses revealed that MCL1 copy number alterations. including low-level gains. are selectively enriched in basal-like breast cancers and associated with effective BET and MCL1 co-targeting. The high frequency of MCL1 chromosomal amplifications (> 30%) and gains (> 50%) in basal-like breast cancers suggests that BET and MCL1 co-inhibition may have therapeutic utility in this aggressive subtype.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:1pC5hbHeJ6IC,0,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3730213,,,,,0,0,0

Here. we survey mtDNA copy number variation across 22 tumor types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We observe a tendency for some cancers. especially of the bladder. breast. and kidney. to be depleted of mtDNA. relative to matched normal tissue. Analysis of genetic context reveals an association between incidence of several somatic alterations. including IDH1 mutations in gliomas. and mtDNA content. In some but not all cancer types. mtDNA content is correlated with the expression of respiratory genes. and anticorrelated to the expression of immune response and cell-cycle genes. In tandem with immunohistochemical evidence. we find that some tumors may compensate for mtDNA depletion to sustain levels of respiratory proteins.

10091786,Supplementary data: Comprehensive modeling of microRNA targets predicts functional non-conserved and non-canonical sites,,Doron Betel and Anjali Koppal and Phaedra Agius and Chris Sander and Christina Leslie,,,,,,Context score values were computed by parsing the AU composition. 3’-binding and UTR position features from predicted microRNA:: target site alignments. Seed specific scores were calculated using the regression parameters described in Grimson et al. Table S6 [8] using the source code downloaded from [39]. Due to differences in predicted miRNA:: target alignments. which in our study were generated by miRanda. the context score values computed based on our predicted duplexes (mirSVR-CS) are not exactly the same as those calculated by TargetScan (TargetScan-CS). and this difference may have some impact on the performance assessment. To assess the significance of the differences between our computed context scores to those provided by TargetScan5. 0. we first calculated the Pearson correlation between the two context score values for the canonical sites in the Linsley data set [21]. We found a significant correlation between the two scores (Supplementary Table 1). and most of the difference can be attributed to variations in the 3’-binding scores. We also correlated the two scores with the observed log expression changes and found that mirSVR-CS values are in fact better correlated with the observed expression changes than the context scores provided by TargetScan. We conclude that differences in predicting the base-pairing in the miRNA:: mRNA duplexes. and the resulting differences in context score values. did not adversely affect context score performance in our comparative analysis.,True,4R7_wW8AAAAJ:GYcXSSpN504C,0,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7419170269486671861&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,,0,0,0

Neither A+ U content of the seed-region nor the entire small RNA are significantly correlated with mean down-regulation (Supplementary Figure 5).The length of 3’-UTRs is weakly correlated with RNA-seq reads (Supplementary Figure 6) and mean down-regulation (Supplementary Figure 7). Since the targets of low-target abundance small RNAs tend to have longer 3’-UTRs and longer 3’-UTRs are associated with increased down-regulation. it could be argued that the length of 3’-UTR is the real determinant of mean down-regulation.

However. rare functional mutations can escape detection by recurrence analysis owing to lack of statistical power. We enhance statistical power by extending the notion of recurrence of mutations from single genes to gene families that share homologous protein domains. Domain mutation analysis also sharpens the functional interpretation of the impact of mutations. as domains more succinctly embody function than entire genes. By mapping mutations in 22 different tumor types to equivalent positions in multiple sequence alignments of domains. we confirm well-known functional mutation hotspots. identify uncharacterized rare variants in one gene that are equivalent to well-characterized mutations in another gene. detect previously unknown mutation hotspots. and provide hypotheses about molecular mechanisms and downstream effects of domain mutations.

We have identified two families of caspase-like proteins. Paracaspases (found in metazoans and Dictyostelium) and metacaspases (found in plants. fungi. and protozoa). Metazoan paracaspase prodomains contain a death domain and immunoglobulin domains. Several plant metacaspase prodomains contain zinc finger motifs resembling those in the plant hypersensitive response/cell death protein lsd-1. The human paracaspase prodomain binds Bcl10. a protein involved in the t(1;14)(p22;q32) translocation of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Another MALT lymphoma translocation. t(11;18)(q21;q21). fuses the IAP-2 gene to the MLT1/MALT1 locus. which encodes the human paracaspase.

This “sister chromatid cohesion” is essential for the alignment of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle during metaphase. Cohesion depends on the multisubunit cohesin complex. which possibly forms the physical bridges connecting sisters. Proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Scc1 subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition is essential for sister chromatid separation and depends on a conserved protein called separin. We show here that separin is a cysteine protease related to caspases that alone can cleave Scc1 in vitro.

UV radiation. oxidizing agents. and electrophilic mutagens. D. radiodurans is best known for its extreme resistance to ionizing radiation; not only can it grow continuously in the presence of chronic radiation (6 kilorads/h). but also it can survive acute exposures to gamma radiation exceeding 1.500 kilorads without dying or undergoing induced mutation. These characteristics were the impetus for sequencing the genome of D. radiodurans and the ongoing development of its use for bioremediation of radioactive wastes. Although it is known that these multiple resistance phenotypes stem from efficient DNA repair processes. the mechanisms underlying these extraordinary repair capabilities remain poorly understood.

10091835,Selection in the evolution of gene duplications,2002,Fyodor A Kondrashov and Igor B Rogozin and Yuri I Wolf and Eugene V Koonin,3,Genome biology,2,1-9,BioMed Central,Gene duplications have a major role in the evolution of new biological functions. Theoretical studies often assume that a duplication per se is selectively neutral and that. following a duplication. one of the gene copies is freed from purifying (stabilizing) selection. which creates the potential for evolution of a new function. In search of systematic evidence of accelerated evolution after duplication. we used data from 26 bacterial. six archaeal. and seven eukaryotic genomes to compare the mode and strength of selection acting on recently duplicated genes (paralogs) and on similarly diverged. unduplicated orthologous genes in different species. We find that the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Kn/Ks) in most paralogous pairs is <<1 and that paralogs typically evolve at similar rates. without significant asymmetry. indicating that both paralogs produced by a duplication are subject to purifying selection. This selection is. however. substantially weaker than the purifying selection affecting unduplicated orthologs that have diverged to the same extent as the analyzed paralogs. Most of the recently duplicated genes appear to be involved in various forms of environmental response; in particular. many of them encode membrane and secreted proteins. The results of this analysis indicate that recently duplicated paralogs evolve faster than orthologs with the same level of divergence and similar functions. but apparently do not experience a phase of neutral evolution. We hypothesize that gene duplications that persist in an evolving lineage are beneficial from the time of their origin. due primarily to a protein dosage effect in response to …,True,F4P3ghEAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC,714,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-research0008,3591353605969132741,/scholar?cites=3591353605969132741,,https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2002-3-2-research0008,0,0,0
10091836,The ancient Virus World and evolution of cells,2006,Eugene V Koonin and Tatiana G Senkevich and Valerian V Dolja,1,,1,1-27,BioMed Central,Recent advances in genomics of viruses and cellular life forms have greatly stimulated interest in the origins and evolution of viruses and. for the first time. offer an opportunity for a data-driven exploration of the deepest roots of viruses. Here we briefly review the current views of virus evolution and propose a new. coherent scenario that appears to be best compatible with comparative-genomic data and is naturally linked to models of cellular evolution that. from independent considerations. seem to be the most parsimonious among the existing ones. Several genes coding for key proteins involved in viral replication and morphogenesis as well as the major capsid protein of icosahedral virions are shared by many groups of RNA and DNA viruses but are missing in cellular life forms. On the basis of this key observation and the data on extensive genetic exchange between diverse viruses. we propose the concept of the ancient virus world. The virus world is construed as a distinct contingent of viral genes that continuously retained its identity throughout the entire history of life. Under this concept. the principal lineages of viruses and related selfish agents emerged from the primordial pool of primitive genetic elements. the ancestors of both cellular and viral genes. Thus. notwithstanding the numerous gene exchanges and acquisitions attributed to later stages of evolution. most. if not all. modern viruses and other selfish agents are inferred to descend from elements that belonged to the primordial genetic pool. In this pool. RNA viruses would evolve first. followed by retroid elements. and DNA viruses.

Although. quantitatively. the genome is even more degraded than those of closely related Rickettsia species. Wolbachia has retained more intact metabolic pathways. The ability to provide riboflavin. flavin adenine dinucleotide. heme. and nucleotides is likely to be Wolbachia's principal contribution to the mutualistic relationship. whereas the host nematode likely supplies amino acids required for Wolbachia growth. Genome comparison of the Wolbachia endosymbiont of B. malayi (wBm) with the Wolbachia endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster (wMel) shows that they share similar metabolic trends. although their genomes show a high degree of genome shuffling. In contrast to wMel. wBm contains no prophage and has a reduced level of repeated DNA. Both Wolbachia have lost a considerable number of membrane biogenesis genes that apparently make them unable to synthesize lipid A. the usual component of proteobacterial membranes.

The role of autoprocessing in biogenesis of the hh signal has been unclear. since a truncated unprocessed protein lacking all carboxy-terminal domain sequences retains signaling activity. Here. we present evidence that the autoprocessing reaction proceeds via an internal thioester intermediate and results in a covalent modification that increases the hydrophobic character of the signaling domain and influences its spatial and subcellular distribution. We demonstrate that truncated unprocessed amino-terminal protein causes embryonic mispatterning. even when expression is localized to cells that normally express Hh. thus suggesting a role for autoprocessing in spatial regulation of hh signaling.

10091874,Orthology. paralogy and proposed classification for paralog subtypes,2002,Erik LL Sonnhammer and Eugene V Koonin,18,,12,619-620,Elsevier Current Trends,The conceptual underpinning of the terms ‘orthology’and ‘paralogy’has been the subject of several recent publications [1–4]. The renewed interest in these descriptors of the evolutionary relationships among genes is not surprising given the need for unambiguous definitions in the fast-growing field of comparative and evolutionary genomics and the widespread confusion about the exact meanings of some key terms.(eg [5–7]). Many researchers seem to believe that orthologs are simply genes (proteins) with the same function in different organisms. whereas paralogs are simply homologs within one organism. This does not agree with the original definitions of orthology and paralogy given by [8](see also [9] for an overview) and could easily lead to confusion. We therefore find it important to clarify these terms in some detail. and also wish to further reduce ambiguity by introducing two new terms for subtypes of paralog. The original definition of orthologs is two genes from two different species that derive from a single gene in the last common ancestor of the species (eg HB and WB in Fig. 1). Paralogs are defined as genes that derive from a single gene that was duplicated within a genome. The latter definition does not specify that paralogs can only be found in a single organism. and hence genes in different organisms that arose from gene duplication in an ancestral genome are also paralogs according to the definition. Several other aspects of orthologous and paralogous relationships between genes have emerged as important in evolutionary genomics. Figure 1 illustrates how multiple genes can simultaneously be orthologs of another gene. in …,True,F4P3ghEAAAAJ:vV6vV6tmYwMC,439,http://www.marcottelab.org/users/BCH391L_2015/Sonnhammer2002TiG.pdf,15913064603651683939,/scholar?cites=15913064603651683939,,http://www.marcottelab.org/users/BCH391L_2015/Sonnhammer2002TiG.pdf,0,0,0

The procedure involves iterative database scans with an evolving position-dependent weight matrix constructed from a coevolving set of aligned conserved segments. For each iteration. the expected distribution of matrix scores under a random model is used to set a cutoff score for the inclusion of a segment in the next iteration. This cutoff may be calculated to allow the chance inclusion of either a fixed number or a fixed proportion of false positive segments. With sufficiently high cutoff scores. the procedure converged for all alignment blocks studied. with varying numbers of iterations required. Different methods for calculating weight matrices from alignment blocks were compared.

Such attempts are particularly relevant because of the major role of horizontal gene transfer and lineage-specific gene loss. at least in the evolution of prokaryotes. Five largely independent approaches were employed to construct trees for completely sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes: i) presence-absence of genomes in clusters of orthologous genes; ii) conservation of local gene order (gene pairs) among prokaryotic genomes; iii) parameters of identity distribution for probable orthologs; iv) analysis of concatenated alignments of ribosomal proteins; v) comparison of trees constructed for multiple protein families. All constructed trees support the separation of the two primary prokaryotic domains. bacteria and archaea. as well as some terminal bifurcations within the bacterial and archaeal domains. Beyond these obvious groupings. the trees made with different methods appeared to differ substantially in terms of the relative contributions of phylogenetic relationships and similarities in gene repertoires caused by similar life styles and horizontal gene transfer to the tree topology.

Lamarck believed that evolution is driven primarily by non-randomly acquired. beneficial phenotypic changes. in particular. those directly affected by the use of organs. which Lamarck believed to be inheritable.

The introns-early concept. later rebranded ‘introns first’ held that protein-coding genes were interrupted by numerous introns even at the earliest stages of life's evolution and that introns played a major role in the origin of proteins by facilitating recombination of sequences coding for small protein/peptide modules.

In agreement with this hypothesis. recent work has shown a negative correlation between evolutionary rates and the number of protein-protein interactions.

In accord with this distinction. the sequenced genomes of euryarchaeal viruses encode many proteins homologous to bacteriophage capsid proteins. In contrast. initial analysis of the crenarchaeal viral genomes revealed no relationships with bacteriophages and. generally. very few proteins with detectable homologs.

10091987,The rhomboids: a nearly ubiquitous family of intramembrane serine proteases that probably evolved by multiple ancient horizontal gene transfers,2003,Eugene V Koonin and Kira S Makarova and Igor B Rogozin and Laetitia Davidovic and Marie-Claude Letellier and Luca Pellegrini,4,Genome biology,3,1-12,BioMed Central,The rhomboid family of polytopic membrane proteins shows a level of evolutionary conservation unique among membrane proteins. They are present in nearly all the sequenced genomes of archaea. bacteria and eukaryotes. with the exception of several species with small genomes. On the basis of experimental studies with the developmental regulator rhomboid from Drosophila and the AarA protein from the bacterium Providencia stuartii. the rhomboids are thought to be intramembrane serine proteases whose signaling function is conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Phylogenetic tree analysis carried out using several independent methods for tree constructions and the corresponding statistical tests suggests that. despite its broad distribution in all three superkingdoms. the rhomboid family was not present in the last universal common ancestor of extant life forms. Instead. we propose that rhomboids evolved in bacteria and have been acquired by archaea and eukaryotes through several independent horizontal gene transfers. In eukaryotes. two distinct. ancient acquisitions apparently gave rise to the two major subfamilies. typified by rhomboid and PARL (presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein). respectively. Subsequent evolution of the rhomboid family in eukaryotes proceeded by multiple duplications and functional diversification through the addition of extra transmembrane helices and other domains in different orientations relative to the conserved core that harbors the protease activity.

This enzyme is highly conserved in most eukaryotes but is missing in archaea and bacteria. No evolutionary relationship between RDRP and other polymerases has been reported so far. hence the origin of this eukaryote-specific polymerase remains a mystery. Using extensive sequence profile searches. we identified bacteriophage homologs of the eukaryotic RDRP. The comparison of the eukaryotic RDRP and their homologs from bacteriophages led to the delineation of the conserved portion of these enzymes. which is predicted to harbor the catalytic site. Further. detailed sequence comparison. aided by examination of the crystal structure of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DDRP). showed that the RDRP and the β' subunit of DDRP (and its orthologs in archaea and eukaryotes) contain a conserved double-psi β-barrel (DPBB) domain. This DPBB domain contains the signature motif DbDGD (b is a bulky residue). which is conserved in all RDRPs and DDRPs and contributes to catalysis via a coordinated divalent cation. Apart from the DPBB domain. no similarity was detected between RDRP and DDRP. which leaves open two scenarios for the origin of RDRP: i) RDRP evolved at the onset of the evolution of eukaryotes via a duplication of the DDRP β' subunit followed by dramatic divergence that obliterated the sequence similarity outside the core catalytic domain and ii) the primordial RDRP. which consisted primarily of the DPBB domain. evolved from a common ancestor with the …,True,F4P3ghEAAAAJ:g3aElNc5_aQC,212,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-3-1,16450704084641118487,/scholar?cites=16450704084641118487,,https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-3-1,0,0,0

In biology. power laws have been claimed to describe the distributions of the connections of enzymes and metabolites in metabolic networks. the number of interactions partners of a given protein. the number of members in paralogous families. and other quantities. In network analysis. power laws imply evolution of the network with preferential attachment. i.e. a greater likelihood of nodes being added to pre-existing hubs. Exploration of different types of evolutionary models in an attempt to determine which of them lead to power law distributions has the potential of revealing non-trivial aspects of genome evolution. A simple model of evolution of the domain composition of proteomes was developed. with the following elementary processes: i) domain birth (duplication with divergence). ii) death (inactivation and/or deletion). and iii) innovation (emergence from non-coding or non-globular sequences or acquisition via horizontal gene transfer). This formalism can be described as a b irth. d eath and i nnovation m odel (BDIM). The formulas for equilibrium frequencies of domain families of different size and the total number of families at equilibrium are derived for a general BDIM.

10092020,Duplicated genes evolve slower than singletons despite the initial rate increase,2004,I King Jordan and Yuri I Wolf and Eugene V Koonin,4,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-11,BioMed Central,Gene duplication is an important mechanism that can lead to the emergence of new functions during evolution. The impact of duplication on the mode of gene evolution has been the subject of several theoretical and empirical comparative-genomic studies. It has been shown that. shortly after the duplication. genes seem to experience a considerable relaxation of purifying selection. Here we demonstrate two opposite effects of gene duplication on evolutionary rates. Sequence comparisons between paralogs show that. in accord with previous observations. a substantial acceleration in the evolution of paralogs occurs after duplication. presumably due to relaxation of purifying selection. The effect of gene duplication on evolutionary rate was also assessed by sequence comparison between orthologs that have paralogs (duplicates) and those that do not (singletons). It is shown that. in eukaryotes. duplicates. on average. evolve significantly slower than singletons. Eukaryotic ortholog evolutionary rates for duplicates are also negatively correlated with the number of paralogs per gene and the strength of selection between paralogs. A tally of annotated gene functions shows that duplicates tend to be enriched for proteins with known functions. particularly those involved in signaling and related cellular processes; by contrast. singletons include an over-abundance of poorly characterized proteins. These results suggest that whether or not a gene duplicate is retained by selection depends critically on the pre-existing functional utility of the protein encoded by the ancestral singleton.

The genetic diversity of viruses is commensurately enormous and might substantially exceed the diversity of cellular organisms. Unlike cellular organisms with their uniform replication-expression scheme. viruses possess either RNA or DNA genomes and exploit all conceivable replication-expression strategies. Although viruses extensively exchange genes with their hosts. there exists a set of viral hallmark genes that are shared by extremely diverse groups of viruses to the exclusion of cellular life forms.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a major mechanism of defense against viruses and transposable elements as well of regulating translation of endogenous mRNAs. The RNAi systems recognize the target RNA molecules via small guide RNAs that are completely or partially complementary to a region of the target. Key components of the RNAi systems are proteins of the Argonaute-PIWI family some of which function as slicers. the nucleases that cleave the target RNA that is base-paired to a guide RNA. Numerous prokaryotes possess the CRISPR-associated system (CASS) of defense against phages and plasmids that is. in part. mechanistically analogous but not homologous to eukaryotic RNAi systems. Many prokaryotes also encode homologs of Argonaute-PIWI proteins but their functions remain unknown. We present a detailed analysis of Argonaute-PIWI protein sequences and the genomic neighborhoods of the respective genes in prokaryotes. Whereas eukaryotic Ago/PIWI proteins always contain PAZ (oligonucleotide binding) and PIWI (active or inactivated nuclease) domains. the prokaryotic Argonaute homologs (pAgos) fall into two major groups in which the PAZ domain is either present or absent. The monophyly of each group is supported by a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved PIWI-domains. Almost all pAgos that lack a PAZ domain appear to be inactivated. and the respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted nucleases in putative operons. An additional. uncharacterized domain that is fused to various nucleases appears to be a unique signature of operons encoding the short (lacking PAZ) pAgo form.

Comparisons of the sets of proteins implicated in phagocytosis in different eukaryotes reveal extreme diversity. with very few highly conserved components that typically do not possess readily identifiable prokaryotic homologs. Nevertheless. phylogenetic analysis of those proteins for which such homologs do exist yields clues to the possible origin of phagocytosis. The central finding is that a subset of archaea encode actins that are not only monophyletic with eukaryotic actins but also share unique structural features with actin-related proteins (Arp) 2 and 3. All phagocytic processes are strictly dependent on remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of branched filaments for which Arp2/3 are responsible. The presence of common structural features in Arp2/3 and the archaeal actins suggests that the common ancestors of the archaeal and eukaryotic actins were capable of forming branched filaments. like modern Arp2/3. The Rho family GTPases that are ubiquitous regulators of phagocytosis in eukaryotes appear to be of bacterial origin. so assuming that the host of the mitochondrial endosymbiont was an archaeon. the genes for these GTPases come via horizontal gene transfer from the endosymbiont or in an earlier event.

10092046,Evolution of genome architecture,2009,Eugene V Koonin,41,,2,298-306,Pergamon,Charles Darwin believed that all traits of organisms have been honed to near perfection by natural selection. The empirical basis underlying Darwin's conclusions consisted of numerous observations made by him and other naturalists on the exquisite adaptations of animals and plants to their natural habitats and on the impressive results of artificial selection. Darwin fully appreciated the importance of heredity but was unaware of the nature and. in fact. the very existence of genomes. A century and a half after the publication of the “Origin”. we have the opportunity to draw conclusions from the comparisons of hundreds of genome sequences from all walks of life.

In most cases. small sample size and low degree of sequence conservation preclude the construction of reliable recognition rules. We suggest an approach to this problem based on simultaneous analysis of several related genomes. It appears that as long as a gene coding for a transcription regulator is conserved in the compared bacterial genomes. the regulation of the respective group of genes (regulons) also tends to be maintained. Thus a gene can be confidently predicted to belong to a particular regulon in case not only itself. but also its orthologs in other genomes have candidate operators in the regulatory regions.

These proteins share 2 conserved sequence motifs with GSTs of other classes (α. μ. and π). Tertiary structure modeling showed that in spite of the relatively low sequence similarity. the GST‐related domain of EF1γ is likely to form a fold very similar to that in the known structures of class α. μ. and π GSTs.

NY,The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas (CRISPR-associated proteins) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system that is represented in most archaea and many bacteria. Among the currently known prokaryotic defense systems. the CRISPR-Cas genomic loci show unprecedented complexity and diversity. Classification of CRISPR-Cas variants that would capture their evolutionary relationships to the maximum possible extent is essential for comparative genomic and functional characterization of this theoretically and practically important system of adaptive immunity. To this end. a multipronged approach has been developed that combines phylogenetic analysis of the conserved Cas proteins with comparison of gene repertoires and arrangements in CRISPR-Cas loci.

Under the 'selfish operon' hypothesis. operons are viewed as mobile genetic entities that are constantly disseminated via horizontal gene transfer. although their retention could be favored by the advantage of coregulation of functionally linked genes. Here we apply comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis to examine horizontal transfer of entire operons versus displacement of individual genes within operons by horizontally acquired orthologs and independent assembly of the same or similar operons from genes with different phylogenetic affinities. Since a substantial number of operons have been identified experimentally in only a few model bacteria. evolutionarily conserved gene strings were analyzed as surrogates of operons. The phylogenetic affinities within these predicted operons were assessed first by sequence similarity analysis and then by phylogenetic analysis. including statistical tests of tree topology. Numerous cases of apparent horizontal transfer of entire operons were detected. However. it was shown that apparent horizontal transfer of individual genes or arrays of genes within operons is not uncommon either and results in xenologous gene displacement in situ. that is. displacement of an ancestral gene by a horizontally transferred ortholog from a taxonomically distant organism without change of the local gene organization. On rarer occasions. operons might have evolved via independent assembly. in part from horizontally acquired genes.

In prokaryotes. the genes for most ribosomal proteins are clustered in several highly conserved operons. which ensures efficient co-regulation of their expression. Duplications of ribosomal-protein genes are infrequent. and given their coordinated expression and functioning. it is generally assumed that ribosomal-protein genes are unlikely to undergo horizontal transfer. However. with the accumulation of numerous complete genome sequences of prokaryotes. several paralogous pairs of ribosomal protein genes have been identified. Here we analyze all such cases and attempt to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these ribosomal proteins. Complete bacterial genomes were searched for duplications of ribosomal proteins. Ribosomal proteins L36. L33. L31. S14 are each duplicated in several bacterial genomes and ribosomal proteins L11. L28. L7/L12. S1. S15. S18 are so far duplicated in only one genome each. Sequence analysis of the four ribosomal proteins. for which paralogs were detected in several genomes. two of the ribosomal proteins duplicated in one genome (L28 and S18). and the ribosomal protein L32 showed that each of them comes in two distinct versions. One form contains a predicted metal-binding Zn-ribbon that consists of four conserved cysteines (in some cases replaced by histidines). whereas. in the second form. these metal-chelating residues are completely or partially replaced.

Both the F-type (found in most bacteria and eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts) and V-type (found in archaea. some bacteria. and eukaryotic vacuoles) ATPases can translocate either protons or sodium ions. The prevalent proton-dependent ATPases are generally viewed as the primary form of the enzyme whereas the sodium-translocating ATPases of some prokaryotes are usually construed as an exotic adaptation to survival in extreme environments. We combine structural and phylogenetic analyses to clarify the evolutionary relation between the proton- and sodium-translocating ATPases. A comparison of the structures of the membrane-embedded oligomeric proteolipid rings of sodium-dependent F- and V-ATPases reveals nearly identical sets of amino acids involved in sodium binding. We show that the sodium-dependent ATPases are scattered among proton-dependent ATPases in both the F- and the V-branches of the phylogenetic tree. Barring convergent emergence of the same set of ligands in several lineages. these findings indicate that the use of sodium gradient for ATP synthesis is the ancestral modality of membrane bioenergetics. Thus. a primitive. sodium-impermeable but proton-permeable cell membrane that harboured a set of sodium-transporting enzymes appears to have been the evolutionary predecessor of the more structurally demanding proton-tight membranes.

10092083,SPOUT: a class of methyltransferases that includes spoU and trmD RNA methylase superfamilies. and novel superfamilies of predicted prokaryotic RNA methylases,2002,Vivek Anantharaman and Eugene V Koonin and L Aravind,4,Journal of molecular microbiology and biotechnology,1,71-76,HORIZON SCIENTIFIC PRESS,Nucleotide modification is a major source of structural and biochemical diversity of RNAs. particularly of rRNAs and tRNAs (Rozenski et al.. 1999). Basespecific methylation is one of the prevalent modes of post-transcriptional modification along with pseudouridylation and thio-uridylation. The catalytic domains of the majority of RNA methylases belong to the vast large superclass of Rossman-fold enzymes (Lo Conte et al.. 2000). These Rossman-fold methylases (RFM) bind S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) via the nucleotide-binding loop typical of this fold and catalyze the transfer of its methyl group to substrates such as DNA. RNA. proteins or small molecules. However. two families of RNA methylases. typified. respectively. by Escherichia coli proteins SpoU (TrmH) and TrmD. appear to be unrelated to the RFMs. SpoU family proteins have been characterized as tRNA (G18) methyltransferases in E. coli and S. cerevisiae (Cavaille et al.. 1999; Koonin et al.. 1993; Persson et al.. 1997). whereas TrmD is responsible for the bacteria-specific tRNA methylation at the G37 position (Bjork et al.. 1989; Li et al.. 1999). Here. we provide evidence for a common evolutionary origin of the TrmD and SpoU methylase superfamilies that were previously considered unrelated. We show that the SpoU superfamily encompasses a greater diversity of (predicted) methylases than previously appreciated and contains two previously undetected families that are specific to the archaea and thermophilic bacteria. Additionally. we identify two previously unnoticed superfamilies of proteins from archaea and bacteria. respectively. that are predicted to be methylases related to …,True,F4P3ghEAAAAJ:LI9QrySNdTsC,155,https://www.caister.com/backlist/jmmb/v/v4/06.pdf,6276029065431646056,/scholar?cites=6276029065431646056,,https://www.caister.com/backlist/jmmb/v/v4/06.pdf,0,0,0
