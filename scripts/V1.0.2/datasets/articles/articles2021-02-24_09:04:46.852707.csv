India,Nanosize surface of sodium montmorillonite has been prepared via sonication and deposited on glassy carbon electrodes for use as working electrode in a highly sensitive electrochemical biosensor for the detection of trace amounts of the calcium channel blocking drug. amlodipine. The cyclic voltammetric behaviour of amlodipine is studied in the pH range of 1.0−13.0. In alkali medium (pH 13.0) the sensor shows good response. Cyclic voltammograms show one oxidation peak and one broad reduction peak. which may be due to the oxidation of secondary amino group and reduction of chlorine and nitro groups respectively. Plots of log peak current and potential when correlated with  log scan rate. indicate irreversible electron diffusion controlled redox reaction. The optimum conditions have been established by differential pulse stripping voltammetry. The anodic peak current is linear with concentration of the analyte at optimum conditions; the detection limit has been determined to be 0.01 μg/mL.

A compound signal was used from DaISy Database which was obtained non-invasively by placing electrodes on the abdomen area of the mother. The obtained signal includes maternal and fetal ECG signals and it was contaminated by various other signals from body and externally induced noises. The single channel signals are recorded and modeled as the summation of several ECGs. Each of the ECG signal is described by a nonlinear dynamic model.

Nanomaterials are widely employed now-a-days for modification because of their electrocatalytic properties and enhanced surface area available for redox reactions. In the present study. multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) modified electrode has been used as an electrochemical sensor for nitrendipine. an important antihypertensive drug. Cyclic voltammograms of nitrendipine exhibit a sharp anodic peak around 440 mV and one broad cathodic peak. Influence of sweep rate and concentration on the peak current and potentials have been investigated. Straight line with good correlation is obtained when the peak current was correlated with the sweep rate. The log peak current and log sweep rate plot yield a slope above 0.5 suggesting adsorption controlled reaction. Nitrendipine show enhanced peak current and decreased peak potential indicating good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation. leading to a marked improvement in sensitivity. This drug has been determined by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry. Systematic variation of pre-concentration and stripping parameters result in optimum values.

We aim to discover the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in pregnancy using high resonance ultrasonography. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study where obstetric patients were screened for CTS and subjected to a non invasive ultrasonic imaging. Results: A total of 63 patients were seen with 25 diagnosed to have CTS (39.7%) and 38 patients had none (60.3%) based on a screening tool. Age ranged from 20-42 years old with the highest range in the 28-30 year old group (34.9%). In patients with CTS. the cross sectional area of the median nerve inside the tunnel was a mean of 0.908 cm² ie larger. while non-CTS patients had a mean of 0.797 cm² inside the tunnel. The transverse carpal ligament (TCL) measured a mean of 0.0988 cm in the CTS group (ie thinner) and 0.1058 cm in the non-CTS group. Median nerve mobility at equal to or less than one tendon width was 80% in pregnant women with CTS and 92.1% for those without. No fluid was present within the carpal tunnel of all patients. The results were statistically not significant. Conclusion: Ultrasonographic evidence in pregnant women with CTS shows a larger median nerve. a more mobile median nerve and a less thick transverse carpal ligament. There is absence of fluid retention and synovitis ruling out extrinsic compression of the median nerve as cause of CTS in pregnancy.,True,s8eGP4MAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,0,http://www.medic.upm.edu.my/upload/dokumen/2020011612142528_MJMHS_0374.pdf,,,,http://www.medic.upm.edu.my/upload/dokumen/2020011612142528_MJMHS_0374.pdf,0,0,0

The electrochemical kinetic analyses of these processes are based on quasi-steady-state polarisation and impedance data. The good agreement between the two sets of measurements allows some basic conclusions to be drawn. In particular. the O2 evolution process is always inhibited at F-doped PbO2 electrodes. and impedance results suggest possible changes in the mechanism. with electrodesorption of intermediates becoming more important as the concentration of the doping element increases.

An assessment of the influence of different experimental parameters on the amount of incorporated Co was made for PbO2 films grown either at constant current or constant potential. The Co content in PbO2 decreases with increasing temperature and pH of the deposition solution. probably due to the fact that increasing the growth electrolyte temperature from 25 to 65 °C causes a decrease of the deposition potential from 1.5 to 1.4 V. Similarly. a rise of the electrolyte pH brings about a decrease of the electrodeposition potential.

The electrodeposition follows the same reaction scheme previously reported in the literature for PbO2. The electrocatalytic activity of the resulting oxides is assessed for the reactions of O2 and O3 evolution. Fluoride and iron into PbO2 have different effects on the electrocatalytic activity of PbO2 for O2 evolution and O3 formation. With F–PbO2 the first process is favoured and the second one inhibited. whereas with Fe–PbO2 electrodes we observed the opposite trend. Lead dioxide grown from F− and Fe(III) containing solutions showed the highest activity for O3 formation. The larger amount of iron incorporated into PbO2 in the presence of F− is proposed as a possible cause of the enhanced activity for ozone formation of (F–Fe)–PbO2 electrodes.,True,RYqCR2cAAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C,121,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022072898002563,1999550642963001909,/scholar?cites=1999550642963001909,,,0,0,0

Contribution of the latter becomes particularly pronounced at high potentials. probably on account of PbO2 dissolution and re-deposition in the form of Pb(OH)4 that subsequently evolves to give PbO(OH)2.

Khimii I Khimicheskoi Tekhnologii,,66-71,,Electropolishing of Al–Mg alloy (5 wt.% of Mg) in a deep eutectic solvent ethaline (a eutectic mixture of choline chloride and ethylene glycol) was investigated. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy revealed that the electrochemical surface treatment in ethaline provided a significant improvement of the surface characteristics of Al–Mg alloy. The amount of surface oxygen decreased after electropolishing of aluminium–magnesium alloy in ethaline as compared with the untreated surface. A removal of aluminium oxide film took place during electropolishing and no anodization was observed. The potentiostatic electropolishing of Al–Mg alloy in ethaline at the potential of+ 6 V (against Ag pseudo-reference electrode) and the temperature of 250C allowed reducing the surfaces roughness coefficient. The study of corrosion behavior of Al–Mg alloy in 10 wt.% NaCl solution before and after electropolishing in ethaline was performed by using liner polarization resistance technique. It was established that the electrochemical polishing in ethaline caused an improvement in corrosion resistance of Al–Mg alloy.

It should be noted that the presence of water in these solutions leads to a change in their physicochemical properties. and will also influence the corrosion resistance of mild steel in these media. The appearance of water in the Ethaline and Reline solvents leads to significant changes in the impedance hodograph. There is a significant decrease in the radii of the hemisphere. which may indicate that the resistance to corrosion is reduced in the presence of water in the solvents Ethaline and Reline. compared to non-aqueous solvents. and the rate of corrosion increases.

Scanning electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy revealed that the electrochemical surface treatment in ethaline provided a significant improvement of the surface characteristics of Al–Mg alloy. The amount of surface oxygen decreased after electropolishing of aluminium–magnesium alloy in ethaline as compared with the untreated surface. A removal of aluminium oxide film took place during electropolishing and no anodization was observed.

The appearance of water in the Ethaline and Reline solvents leads to significant changes in the impedance hodograph. There is a significant decrease in the radii of the hemisphere. which may indicate that the resistance to corrosion is reduced in the presence of water in the solvents Ethaline and Reline. compared to non-aqueous solvents. and the rate of corrosion increases. An equivalent electric circuit for Ethaline and Reline solvents was proposed and its parameters were calculated. With increasing water content to 20% in Ethaline and Reline the corrosion resistance decreased by 1.2 and 1.8 times. respectively. it is mean that the solvents became more"" aggressive"" to mild steel. Such changes in corrosion behaviour of investigated solutions caused by changes in their physicochemical properties. It was found that the increase of water content leads to significant decrease of viscosity of solutions. the presence of 20% water decreased the viscosity value 4 times for Ethaline and 9 times for Reline …",True,U-wF-XcAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,1,http://eurocorr.efcweb.org/2018/abstracts/6+8/104132.pdf,17684241700082412676,/scholar?cites=17684241700082412676,,http://eurocorr.efcweb.org/2018/abstracts/6+8/104132.pdf,0,0,0

1075362,Deep Eutectic Solvent Reline− Highly Efficient Electrolyte For Stainless Steel Electropolishing,,Anna Kityk and Natalia Bannyk and Olena Kun,,,,,,Well known that electropolishing improves the near surface chemistry of stainless steel [1. 2]. Not only does it remove embedded particles and inclusions. it also improves the atomic ratios of the material’s alloying elements. Electropolishing preferentially dissolves Iron from the material and leaves the surface with a higher relative concentration of Chromium. Upon exposure to Oxygen. this improved surface will form a thicker and more uniform oxide layer with enhanced corrosion resistance properties. Electropolished stainless steels are better suited to resist the onset of pitting corrosion. crevice corrosion. stress corrosion cracking. and microbiologically influenced corrosion.«Traditional» electropolishing technologies use toxic mixtures of chemicals-concentrated solutions of sulfuric. hydrochloric. orthophosphoric. hydrofluoric. nitric acids with the addition of glycols. chromic anhydride. etc [3-7]. Such kind of electrolytes capable of destroying industrial equipment. harming the environment and human health. Moreover. chemically aggressive mixtures are not always effective and do not lead to the necessary improvement in the quality of functional materials (metals and alloys). Modern low temperature ionic liquids–deep eutectic solvents (DESs) can be perfect alternative for traditional toxic electropolishing electrolytes. For example such DES as Reline (eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea with molar ratio 1: 2 respectively) are not only environmentally friendly. but also possess a number of very attractive properties: chemical. thermal. electrochemical stability. availability of components. ease of synthesis and relatively high as for ionic liquids …,True,U-wF-XcAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,0,https://openreviewhub.org/sites/default/files/cte/1465/kitykaa.pdf,,,,https://openreviewhub.org/sites/default/files/cte/1465/kitykaa.pdf,0,0,0

At the initial adsorption stage. FePc molecules prefer to adsorb on terrace dispersedly as isolated adsorbates because of the stronger molecule−substrate interaction than the lateral intermolecular interaction. Two different configurations of FePc on Au(111) surface are resolved on the basis of STM image analysis and are further identified by DFT calculations. When increasing molecule coverage. the intermolecular interaction becomes more important. The FePc molecules assemble to dimers. trimers. and short chains and even peculiar porous hexamers with two configurations.

It is found that the HM is a rather complex phenomenon. determined by the ligand field splitting of d-orbitals of the transition metal atoms. the exchange splitting and the number of valence electrons. Since most of the conjugated carbon based structures possess ligands with intermediate strength. the ordering of the d-orbital splitting is similar in all structures. and the HM properties evolve according to the number of valence electrons. Based on this insight we predict that Cr-. Fe-and Co-doped graphyne will show HM. while Mn-and Ni-doped graphyne will not. By tuning the number of valence electrons. we are thus able to control the emergence of HM and control the energy gaps evolving in the majority or minority spin channels.,True,-rUJWnEAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC,17,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/25/50/505502/meta,11306921186235718588,/scholar?cites=11306921186235718588,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.6453,0,0,0

We then used the Bardeen integral to calculate the tunnel current from the electronic structure of sample and tip numerically.

The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction under different external forces are further investigated using the elastic scattering Green's function method. The numerical results show that different interface configurations result in different rupture forces. The rupture force is about 1.75 nN when the terminal S atom is sited at the hollow position of Au (111) surface. However. the rupture force is about 1.0 nN when the terminal S atom links with one Au atom which is on the gold surface singly. And with the breakdown of the molecular junction. the single Au atom is pulled away from the gold surface by the terminal S atom. These two results are consistent with different experimental measurements respectively. The molecule is twisted under the electrode pressure and thus further induces the surface Au atom to glide on the gold surface. However. the processes of the molecule twisted by pressure and restored by pulling are two irreversible processes. The stretching force of electrode is 0.7–0.8 nN. and the conductance always shows a minimal value under different interface configurations and twisting states. which is consistent with experimental conclusion. The change of the coupling between the terminal atom and the electrodes induced by the electrode force is the main factor of influencing the conductance of the molecular system. The existence of bimolecular junction results in a small possibility of higher conductance …,True,64cP2E4AAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,10,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-WLXB201406046.htm,13849531259835426191,/scholar?cites=13849531259835426191,,,0,0,0

When femtosecond laser pulses were used to reduce and pattern GO. oxygen contents in the reduced region could be modulated by varying the laser power. In this way. the bandgap of reduced GO was precisely modulated from 2.4 to 0.9 eV by tuning the femtosecond laser power from 0 to 23 mW. Through the first-principle study. the essence of GO bandgap tailoring is proved to be femtosecond laser reduction induced oxygen-content modulation. As representative illustrations. bottom-gate graphene FETs were fabricated in situ by using femtosecond laser reduced GO as the channel material. and an optimized room temperature on–off ratio of 56 is obtained.

H2 dissociation on metal surfaces has been widely studied for several decades because it is an important step in hydrogenation reactions. The efficiency of the process depends on both the electronic properties of the metal surface and the surface microstructures [1]. Enhanced efficiency and reduced cost are usually achieved by using nanoparticles. which have increased the surface-to-volume ratio and low-coordination atoms [2]. Another approach is to optimize the local electronic states of the metal surface by doping [3]. alloying with other elements [4]. or by taking advantage of strong interactions between metal nanoparticles and the supporting substrate [5].

The adsorption behavior of a molecule on a metal surface is of great importance from both fundamental and technological points of view. Herein. based on first-principles calculations. the adsorption of a 4. 4 ″-diamino-p-terphenyl (DAT) molecule on a Cu (001) surface has been systematically explored. The most stable configuration is the DAT molecule lying flat with a rotation angle of 13 relative to the [100] surface direction. It was found that the adsorption sites of benzene rings and nitrogen atoms in the DAT molecule have important influences on the stability of the adsorption configuration. Electron density differences analysis shows that the electrons accumulate at the DAT-Cu (001) interface. The density of states projected on a DAT molecule of DAT/Cu (001) exhibits a metallic character. while the freestanding ones are semiconducting. indicating a strong interaction between the DAT molecule and the Cu (001) surface in the most stable adsorption configuration. These results provide useful information for tuning the properties and functions of DAT molecules. and may offer useful insights for other organic molecule/surface systems.

The most important parameter for the mercury uptake is the type of sulfur introduced rather than the total amount and it was found that the H2S treatment of ACF leads to samples with the highest mercury uptake. despite the lower sulfur amount introduced. The modified samples by both methods can remove HgCl2 from aqueous solutions at pH 6 within the range 290–710 mg/g (ACF) which can be favourably compared with other studies already published …,True,Ey--wQwAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,82,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433205015412,18288773673832974221,/scholar?cites=18288773673832974221,,https://www.academia.edu/download/53528180/j.apsusc.2005.11.03420170615-2986-188d3me.pdf,0,0,0

It was found that prolonged exposure to water vapor provoked structural alterations in all of the MCM-41 materials studied. the most significant effects being a loss of pore shape uniformity and a large decrease in pore size and. in consequence. pore volume. Analysis of the results suggests that these alterations are due to expansion of the pore walls as well as. in some cases. to a collapse involving rupture of the walls. It is also confirmed that silylation is effective in stabilizing the pore structure but only at the expense of much lower pore volume and pore width. ,True,Ey--wQwAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC,78,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/la9904915,16713044936863747690,/scholar?cites=16713044936863747690,,,0,0,0

Implicit in the supramolecular description of a crystal structure is the fact that molecules in a crystal are held together by noncovalent interactions. The need for rational approaches towards solid‐state structures of fundamental and practical importance has led to the emergence of crystal engineering. which seeks to understand intermolecular interactions and recognition phenomena in the context of crystal packing.

The strength of this attraction increases with the increasing electronegativity of either of the atoms. and in the classical view. all hydrogen bonds are highly electrostatic and sometimes even partly covalent. Gradually. the concept of a hydrogen bond has become more relaxed to include weaker and more dispersive interactions. provided some electrostatic character remains. A great variety of very strong. strong. moderately strong. weak. and very weak hydrogen bonds are observed in practice. Weak hydrogen bonds are now invoked in several matters in structural chemistry and biology.

Step-function equivalent profiles were then constructed to obtain the absolute electron density scale. We have compared the electron density profiles of the above preparations to determine the location of the drug molecule in the bilayer. By using (−)-5′-iodo-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol in parallel experiments. we were also able to locate the iodine atom in the bilayer and deduce the conformation of the cannabinoid side alkyl chain. All comparisons were made between different preparations having the same mesomorphic form and total period repeat distance.

J. Agric.

In the present paper 1H NMR spectroscopy is applied to confirm the previous conclusions and to obtain additional physical−chemical characteristics that may be used to differentiate zivania from other similar beverages. NMR spectroscopy gave a satisfactory degree of prediction and classification between zivanias and other distillings. The validity of quantification of the method was tested using comparative GC data. It appears that chemical analysis can be very helpful for identifying the unique geological and climatic conditions existing in the island of Cyprus that lead to an authentic product.

In the last glacial maximum. Fagus sylvatica (beech) was confined to Southern Europe where it was dominant and in the last thousand years has expanded its range to dominate central Europe. We sampled four different beech forest types. We found 298 insect species associated with beech trees and dead beech wood. While F. sylvatica and Quercus (oak) are confamilial. there are great differences in richness of the associated entomofauna. Insect species that inhabit beech forests are less than one fifth of those species living in oak dominated forests despite the fact that beech is the most abundant central and north European tree. There is a distinct paucity of monophagous species on beech trees and most insect species are shared between co-occurring deciduous tree species and beech. This lack of species is attributed to the vegetation history and secondary plant chemistry. Bark and leaf biophenols from beech indicate that differences in plant secondary metabolites may be responsible for the differences in the richness of entomofauna in communities dominated by beech and other deciduous trees.

The analysis of monoterpenoid and morphological variability of 122 pine trees at five sites showed that the within-site heterogeneity is high while the entire provenance diversity is comparable with that of a circum-Mediterranean scale. Four morphotypes and four chemotypes were recognized. The congruence between morphological and monoterpenoid classification of pines was high (coefficient of contingency 89%) while thirteen family groups of genetically closely related trees were found by means of a specifically designed sampling scheme of continuous classification–identification and re-sampling. Putative hybrids contributed substantially to the observed diversity and there is considerable heterogeneity between sites. Low-altitude sites. presumably susceptible to sea-level fluctuations. alluvial deposition and human influence. are in general more diverse at both levels of genetic complexity than inland sites. The hybrid phenotypes were not merely intermediate forms of parental taxa. and in a multivariate sense they are located on a parabola in the space of morphological properties. The arrangement of hybrids in the monoterpenoid space did not reveal any clear-cut pattern except that three major composite axes can summarize 98.9% of the entire monoterpenoid variation. The observed pattern of variation was interpreted as a result of waves of introgressive influence of eastern P. brutia population on P. halepensis. which was caused by marine transgressions in Pliocene and eustatic sea-level fluctuations in Pleistocene.

Studies have attributed the activity of supported MnOx catalysts in oxidative coupling reactions of CH4 to the formation of Mn3O4-like surface species [8]. and revealed that its oxidation selectivity is controllable by alkali halide additives [7. 8]. Infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed CO could help to probe the exposure on Mn3O4 surfaces of coordinatively unsaturated MnII and MnIII sites [9]. The spinel lattice assumed by the oxide (MnII and MnIII cations distributed respectively in a 2: 1 ratio in octahedral and tetrahedral sites) allows for the occurence of O2À-mediated dd electron exchange interactions between the MnII and MnIII sites [10]. The electron-mobile environment thus generated enhances the oxidation activity at Mn3O4 surfaces [11]. As a matter of fact [10]. electron mobilization across a solid surface is enhanced when the underlying solid matrix is of the same chemical composition. Mn3O4 is often synthesized by the high-temperature calcination (at> 1000 8C) of either higher manganese oxides (MnO2. Mn5O8. and Mn2O3); or MnII and MnIII oxysalts. hydroxides. or hydroxyoxides [12. 13]. Consequently. sintering of the product particles is activated and the surface thus generated is rendered hardly accessible [14]. The exploration of lowtemperature routes for the synthesis of Mn3O4 has. therefore. been worth attempting. The literature cites a few attempts to synthesize Mn3O4 at low-temperature regimes. Of the routes explored. two have been found most promising: solgel processing of manganese alkoxides …,True,gQalor0AAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC,69,https://www.academia.edu/download/38417564/111.pdf,9571718132736882177,/scholar?cites=9571718132736882177,,https://www.academia.edu/download/38417564/111.pdf,0,0,0

At room temperature. Py was irreversibly adsorbed via coordination to Lewis sites of different acid strengths. High temperature calcination (at 800 °C) of ceria greatly reduced the Py adsorption capacity of the surface. Upon thermoevacuation at 100–400 °C. Py cracking occurred with formation of various surface species (among these caboxylates and nitrites) deriving from cleavage of the ring via attack of surface oxygen on adsorbed Py.

According to these revolutionary theories. a radiation (light) field consists of one type of unit. namely photons. while matter consists of another type of unit. namely molecules or atoms. Through the interaction between these two types of elementary particles. there is an energy exchange between the radiation and the matter. which in general can be described as the absorption or emission of photons by the matter. In the early developmental stage of the quantum theories. scientists mostly considered only the processes of either one-photon absorption or one-photon emission; both processes were easily observed under common experimental conditions and in our daily life.

In this letter. we report cooperative enhancement of two-photon absorption in multi-branched structures which may lead to new design criteria for development of highly efficient two-photon materials. The multi-branched structures were synthesized using coupling of two and three two-photon active asymmetric donor−acceptor chromophores linked together by a common amine group. The two-photon cross-sections measured both with nanosecond and femtosecond pulses show that the value for the trimer is more than six times larger than that for the monomer. and not just three times larger as expected from the number density increase. ,True,WlZqdokAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,519,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp992846z,4693645006554123562,/scholar?cites=4693645006554123562,,,0,0,0

The effects of the Er3+ concentration and different codopants (Yb3+ and Y3+) in the ZrO2 matrix on the upconverted emission are reported. Green and red upconversion emission at 550 and 670 nm were observed from these oxide nanocrystals with 980 nm excitation. The overall intensity decreases with an increasing concentration of erbium in zirconia. The presence of codopants (Y3+ and Yb3+) also increases the overall intensity of the upconverted emission. The emission spectra and the pump intensity dependence of the luminescence intensities are used to understand the excitation mechanism.

The improved understanding of the consequences of pi-electron delocalization upon nonlinear optical properties and charge carrier dynamics has laid the foundation for the rapid development and application of the electroresponse of conjugated polymers. As a result. the area of electroactive and nonlinear optical polymers is emerging as a frontier of sCience and technology. It is a multidisciplinary field that is bringing together scientists and engineers of varied background to interface their expertise. The recent explosion of interest in this area stems from the prospect of utilizing nonlinear optical effects for optical switching and logic operations in optical computing. optical signal processing. optical sensing and optical fiber communications. Polymers and organic are rapidly becoming one of the major material classes for nonlinear optical applications along with multiple quantum wells. ferroelectrics and other oxides. and direct band-gap semiconductors.

In contrast to the aluminum or chromium analogues we previously reported. the iron MIL-53 solid. which initially exhibits a closed structure in the dry state. shows more complex adsorption isotherms with multisteps occurring at pressures that depend on the nature of the alkane.

The roles of the length of the alkyl chain (n = 1−9). the nature of the metal (Al. Cr). and temperature were investigated. The shape of the adsorption curves is driven by the alkyl chain length of the n-alkanes. While traditional type-I isotherms are observed for short alkanes (n = 1. 2). adsorbates with longer chains induce clear substeps in the isotherm curves whose positions depend on the chain length. Such substeps are due to a breathing phenomenon. as proven by ex situ X-ray diffraction analysis. They strongly depend on the amount of adsorbate in the pores and on the nature of the metal (Al.

Graphite inverse opals. comprising 40-angstrom-thick layers of graphite sheets tiled on spherical surfaces. were produced by surface templating.

Although a negative Poisson's ratio (that is. a lateral extension in response to stretching) is not forbidden by thermodynamics. this property is generally believed to be rare in crystalline solids 1. In contrast to this belief. 69% of the cubic elemental metals have a negative Poisson's ratio when stretched along the [110] direction. For these metals. we find that correlations exist between the work function and the extremal values of Poisson's ratio for this stretch direction. which we explain using a simple electron-gas model.

Likewise. most materials contract in all directions when hydrostatically compressed and decrease density when stretched. so they have positive linear compressibilities.

Density-normalized sheet toughness. strength. and modulus were substantially increased by this mixing.

GaAs substrates exhibit a large density of pits and cracks after usual thermal treatment employed for oxide desorption. On this kind of surface mounds form and coalesce as film thickness increases; surface planarization is eventually achieved—at this point. morphologies are typically those expected from two-dimensional growth. In this sense we observe that monolayer island size distribution is determined by the kinetic conditions used for the growth; nucleation sites and island spatial distribution. however. are strongly influenced by the topography of the initial surface where the film is deposited even for films thousands of monolayers thick.

In an ideal graphane structure C–H bonds exhibit an alternating pattern (up and down with relation to the plane defined by the carbon atoms).

These nanotubes. called graphynes. result from the elongation of covalent interconnections of graphite-based nanotubes by the introduction of yne groups. Analogous to ordinary nanotubes. armchair. zigzag and chiral graphyne nanotubes are possible. Tight-binding and ab initio density functional methods were used to predict the electronic properties of these unusual nanotubes. Of the three graphyne nanotube families analysed here. two provide metallic behaviour for armchair tubes and either metallic or semiconducting behaviour for zigzag nanotubes.

Actuation in response to voltage ramps and potentiostatic pulses is studied to quantify the dependence of the actuation strain on the applied voltage. Strains of up to 0.5% are obtained in response to applied potentials of 2.5 V. The dependence of strain on applied voltage and charge is found to be quadratic. in agreement with previous results on the actuation of single-wall carbon nanotubes. with the magnitude of strain also being very similar.

For instance. it has not been clearly established whether knowledge about the composition and structure of the bioadsorbent raw material is equally important to its availability at its point of use. Various physical and chemical modifications of biomass have been shown to boost the ability of the cellulose-based material to bind various metal ions. Systems of data analysis and mechanistic models are described. There is a continuing need to explain the mechanisms of these approaches and to determine the most effective treatments. Finally. the article probes areas where more research is urgently needed.

A review,2007,Martin A Hubbe and Richard A Venditti and Orlando J Rojas,2,,4,739-788,,Both reversible and irreversible changes take place as cellulosic fibers are manufactured into paper products one or more times. This review considers both physical and chemical changes. It is proposed that by understanding these changes one can make better use of cellulosic fibers at various stages of their life cycles. achieving a broad range of paper performance characteristics. Some of the changes that occur as a result of recycling are inherent to the fibers themselves. Other changes may result from the presence of various contaminants associated with the fibers as a result of manufacturing processes and uses.

Transportation fuel represents a large proportion of energy consumption. not only in the US. but also world-wide. As fossil fuel is being depleted. new substitutes are needed to provide energy. Ethanol. which has been produced mainly from the fermentation of corn starch in the US. has been regarded as one of the main liquid transportation fuels that can take the place of fossil fuel. However. limitations in the supply of starch are creating a need for different substrates. Forest biomass is believed to be one of the most abundant sources of sugars. although much research has been reported on herbaceous grass. agricultural residue. and municipal waste. The use of biomass sugars entails pretreatment to disrupt the lignin-carbohydrate complex and expose carbohydrates to enzymes. This paper reviews pretreatment technologies from the perspective of their potential use with wood. bark. and forest residues. Acetic acid catalysis is suggested for the first time to be used in steam explosion pretreatment. Its pretreatment economics. as well as that for ammonia fiber explosion pretreatment. is estimated.

Both crystals show an increase of flow stress with decreasing diameter. but the change is more pronounced in Au than in Mo. The ratio between the observed maximum flow stress and the theoretical strength is much larger in Au pillars than in Mo pillars. Dislocation dynamics simulations also reveal different dislocation behavior in these two metals. While in a f.c.c. crystal a dislocation loop nucleated from the surface simply moves on its glide plane and exits the pillar. in a b.c.c. crystal it can generate multiple new dislocations due to the ease of screw dislocations to change slip planes.

We present results from high rate. needle-mediated cavity expansions in soft silicone and ballistic gelatin samples with moduli on the order of 10 kPa.

The incorporated material nonlinearity alters the fracture response. resulting in a measured fracture energy value higher than the prediction from network binding energy [Lake and Thomas. 1967]. To understand the dependence of fracture energy on the nonlinear constitutive response. we control the crack tip geometry via cutting. A Y-shaped cutting geometry. inspired by Lake and Yeoh (1978). uses two separated``legs''to form a cutting notch that minimizes contact friction. A blade aligned with the notch imposes its radius during cutting. We find that cutting fracture energy increases nonlinearly with large blade radii. The radius sensitivity reflects the strain-stiffening constitutive response governing crack-blunting during tearing.

These brushlike macromolecules have been prepared previously using the macromonomer method. 1-6 Macromonomers. usually prepared by anionic polymerization. were homopolymerized using conventional radical methods to maximize the number of branches possible from a linear backbone based on vinyl monomers. Upon fractionation of these materials using size exclusion chromatography. samples of narrow polydispersities were obtained which could then be cast on surfaces to form highly ordered thin films. To avoid the rigorous methods necessary for ionic polymerizations and sample fractionation. and to extend the variety of compositional content of these types of materials. atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) has been used to prepare similar macromolecular architectures. The approach described here involves grafting from a macroinitiator and can offer greater versatility in terms of both the length and the composition of the backbone and/or the side chains than previous methods which employed the synthesis of high molecular weight macromonomers and their subsequent polymerization by uncontrolled radical techniques; to obtain welldefined polymeric brushes required their fractionation. generally by SEC.

Specifically. spherical particles with controllable size (∼90 nm to 1 μm) were obtained from water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsions formulated with a mixture of nonionic surfactants and a colloidal dispersion of a low molecular weight alkali lignin. After spontaneous emulsification. the internal lignin-rich phase was cross-linked to produce the solid particles that could be easily separated by removal of the organic. continuous phase. The efficiency of the fractionated lignin particles to stabilize hexadecane-in-water Pickering emulsions was demonstrated and their properties were compared against those obtained by using traditional inorganic particles.

Microemulsions were formulated with aqueous solutions of urea or ethylenediamine and applied to disrupt interfibril hydrogen bonding. Compared to typical fibrillation of lignin-containing and lignin-free fibers. pretreatment with microemulsion systems allowed energy savings during microfluidization of 55 and 32%. respectively. Moreover. microemulsion processing facilitated smaller-scale CNF structures (higher degrees of deconstruction). with higher water retention value (WRV) and surface area. Urea-containing microemulsions were found to be most effective in reducing energy consumption and in weakening the cellulosic matrix.

The addition of CNF to the aqueous phase expanded the composition range to obtain W/O/W emulsions. CNF also increased the viscosity of the continuous phase and reduced the drop size both of which increased the stability and effective viscosity of the emulsions. The effects of oil type and polarity on the properties of the W/O/W emulsions were tested with limonene and octane. which compared to soybean oil produced a smaller emulsion drop size. and thus a higher emulsion viscosity. Overall. CNF are a feasible alternative to conventional polysaccharides as stability enhancers for normal and multiple emulsions that exhibit strong shear thinning behavior.,True,kwoC6kYAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC,46,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979714009813,12285655162818298772,/scholar?cites=12285655162818298772,,,0,0,0

Non-ionic surfactants were used in CNF aqueous dispersions equilibrated with an organic phase (for demonstration. a polystyrene solution. PS. was used).

In this work. we investigate the interactions at the solid–liquid interface of lignin with the two main proteins in soy. glycinin (11S) and β-conglycinin (7S). The extent of adsorption of 11S and 7S onto lignin films and the degree of hydration of the interfacial layers is quantified via Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Solution ionic strength and protein denaturation (2-mercaptoethanol and urea) critically affect the adsorption process as protein molecules undergo conformational changes and their hydrophobic or hydrophilic amino acid residues interact with the surrounding medium.

SEM revealed that the addition of polyethylene oxide as a coadjutant indeed facilitated the formation of defect-free fibers whose diameter increased with lignin concentration. in the range between ≈ 124 and ≈ 400 nm.

Mackin. 2009; Nypelö et al. 2015; Ogunkoya et al. 2015; Oroumei et al. 2015). Annually. over 70 million tons of lignin are produced worldwide. mainly as by product from the kraft pulping process but only 5% is used in commercial applications (Laurichesse. Avérous 2016) Understanding kraft lignin (KL) colloidal behavior is needed to guarantee suitable uses. Some reasons for the limited use of lignin include the complexity of its structure due to the isolation process and the variability from different sources. its wide molecular weight distribution. solubility. condensation and repolymerization after fragmentation. and incompatibility with other polymers or matrices. During the kraft pulping process the aryl-ether bonds in lignin are cleaved (Sjöström 1981) and the residual KL develop more acidic groups (Sjöstrom 1989). Lignin is soluble in a wide range of solvents such as aliphatic alcohols and acids. methyl and ethyl acetate. acetone. chloroform. dioxane. pyridine. dimethyl sulfide. and tetrahydrofuran. However. KL can be readily dissolved in alkaline conditions (Vainio et al. 2004) and its phase behavior is controlled by temperature. pH. and ionic strength (Norgren et al. 2001). The self-associative behavior of KL has been studied already (Lindström 1980; Lindström 1979; Norgren et al. 2002; Norgren et al. 2001; Nyman et al. 1986; Ratnaweera et al. 2015) and has been considered as that of typical polyelectrolytes in aqueous media (Helander et al. 2013).

This prerequisite limits viability in closed or inert systems and puts forward the challenge of developing materials with intrinsically encoded shape evolution. Herein we demonstrate programmable shape-memory materials that perform a sequence of encoded actuations under constant environment conditions without using an external trigger.

Reversible shifting of the grating height was accomplished through partial melting and recrystallization of semicrystalline poly(octylene adipate). The concurrent variations of the grating shape and diffraction intensity were monitored via atomic force microscopy and first order diffraction measurements. respectively.

A high level of uptake of metal ions on the solid surface occurs within ca. 2 h of contact time.

The surface area and pore size of carbon were controlled by varying the precursor carbon to KOH mass ratio. The specific surface area significantly increased with the increasing amount of KOH. reaching a specific surface area of 2521 m 2/g for a 1: 3 mass ratio of precursor carbon/KOH. However. a 1: 1 mass ratio of precursor carbon/KOH displayed the optimum charge storage capacitance of 407 F/g. owing to the ideal combination of micro-and mesopores and a higher degree of graphitization. The capacitive performance varied with the electrolyte employed. The orange-peel-derived electrode in KOH electrolyte displayed the maximum capacitance and optimum rate capability. The orange-peel-derived electrode maintained above 100% capacitance retention during 5000 cyclic tests and identical charge storage over different bending status. The fabricated supercapacitor device delivered high energy density (100.4 µWh/cm 2) and power density (6.87 mW/cm 2). along with improved performance at elevated temperatures.

X-ray diffraction showed presence of crystalline MoS2 structure. where content of crystalline phase was observed to increase with hydrothermal reaction time. Electrochemical properties of MoS2 were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge in 3M KOH solution. Specific capacitance of nanostructured MoS2 was observed to be between 68 F/g and 346 F/g at different scan rates along with excellent cyclic stability. High power density (~1200 W/kg) and energy density (~5 Wh/kg) was observed for MoS2 sample synthesized for 24 hours of hydrothermal reaction time. Overall optimal electrocapactive performance was observed for sample prepared for …,True,9i0SBnQAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,2,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1557/adv.2016.421,14919896172848384600,/scholar?cites=14919896172848384600,,,0,0,0

High RRs of 120 nm min− 1 and 160 nm min− 1 were obtained with 0.13 M glycine+ 1 wt% silica at pH 5 and with 0.13 M taurine+ 1 wt% silica at pH 6. respectively. both at an applied pressure of 3 psi. These compositions suppressed silicon nitride and silicon dioxide RRs to< 2 nm min− 1. making them excellent candidates for polishing a-SiCN hard mask layers during semiconductor fabrication. The role of the amino acids and taurine in polishing a-SiCN films was investigated using zeta potential measurements. attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The reactivity of the deprotonated carboxyl species of the amino acids with SiCN surface is responsible for …,True,9i0SBnQAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC,0,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2162-8777/ab7b45/meta,,,,,0,0,0

However. a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput. genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method. structure-seq. in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism. with quantitative structural information across more than 10.000 transcripts.
