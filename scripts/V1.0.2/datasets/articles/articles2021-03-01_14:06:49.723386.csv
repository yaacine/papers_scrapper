Current CRFs are used but only in a limited market due to relatively high costs and doubts about their abilities to result in higher yields and increased profitability for agricultural businesses. New technologies are emerging that promise to improve the efficacy of CRFs to add additional functionality and reduce cost to make CRFs a more viable alternative to traditional chemical fertilizer treatment.

Moreover. we show that microneedle‐containing devices can be passed and excreted from the GI tract safely. These findings strongly support the success of implementation of microneedle technology for use in the GI tract. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals.

Although PEI shows promise in the field of gene therapy. to date no rigorous proof of mechanism has been published regarding the fate of PEI/DNA administered for transfection. Here we show. by using fluorescent labeling and confocal microscopy. the paths of PEI/DNA complexes from endocytosis to gene expression. We found that complexes attach to cell surfaces and migrate into clumps that are endocytosed. The endocytotic vesicles grow in number and size and are occasionally seen to lyse. Most interesting is the fact that endocytosed PEI. whether administered with or without DNA. undergoes nuclear localization in the form of ordered structures.,True,LcC3XAsAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,1019,https://www.pnas.org/content/96/9/5177.short,13284469036787255784,/scholar?cites=13284469036787255784,,https://www.pnas.org/content/96/9/5177.long,0,0,0

Most foreign particulates. including conventional particle-based drug delivery systems. are efficiently trapped in human mucus layers by steric obstruction and/or adhesion. Trapped particles are typically removed from the mucosal tissue within seconds to a few hours depending on anatomical location. thereby strongly limiting the duration of sustained drug delivery locally.

However. poor solubility. stability. and bioavailability of many drugs make achieving therapeutic levels via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract challenging. Drug delivery must overcome numerous hurdles. including the acidic gastric environment and the continuous secretion of mucus that protects the GI tract. Nanoparticle drug carriers that can shield drugs from degradation and deliver them to intended sites within the GI tract may enable more efficient and sustained drug delivery.

The results provide direct evidence to dispute the common belief that the efficiency of nonviral gene carriers is dramatically reduced because of the need for their relatively slow random diffusion through the cell cytoplasm to the nucleus and. instead. focuses the attention of rational carrier …,True,eAEtxi0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,451,https://www.pnas.org/content/100/7/3878.short,16210115951589325644,/scholar?cites=16210115951589325644,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/100/7/3878.full.pdf,0,0,0

This size range is large enough to allow diffusion of signaling molecules. nutrients. and metabolic waste products. but too small to allow efficient penetration of most particulate drug delivery systems and viruses carrying therapeutic genes. thereby limiting effectiveness of many potential therapies. We analyzed the movements of nanoparticles of various diameters and surface coatings within fresh human and rat brain tissue ex vivo and mouse brain in vivo.

It is an interdisciplinary field that requires knowledge of the field of pure polymer science. familiarity with emulsion technology (1). and an in-depth understanding of drug and protein stabilization (2).

Existing methods for preparing such micro-particles do not. however. always guarantee a constant release rate. for example because drug molecules may be trapped preferentially at the surface. because they have to diffuse through an increasing thickness of polymer when the particles are non-eroding or because the surface area changes for eroding particles. In other situations pulsed release may be required—an application to which simple polymer microspheres do not readily lend themselves. Multi-walled microspheres might solve some of these problems.

When the pH inside the polymer system changes. the solubility of the drug shifts dramatically. which changes the diffusion or dissolution driving force. and hence the release rate changes correspondingly. This concept was tested using a controlled-release system of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer containing insulin and immobilized glucose oxidase. The enzymatic reaction of glucose to gluconic acid reduces the pH in the polymer microenvironment. Since insulin solubility increases with decreasing pH (at physiologic pH. this is true for an insulin with an isoelectric point of 7.4 or higher). the release of insulin increases in response to glucose concentration.

Proteins were encapsulated at high and low loadings in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) by a phase inversion technique.

We report here studies that suggest that VEGF potentiates angiogenesis in vivo and prolongs the survival of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) in vitro by inducing expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Growth-factor-enriched and serum-deficient cultures of HDMECs grown on collagen type I gels with VEGF exhibited a 4-fold and a 1.6-fold reduction. respectively. in the proportion of apoptotic cells. Enhanced HDMEC survival was associated with a dose-dependent increase in Bcl-2 expression and a decrease in the expression of the processed forms of the cysteine protease caspase-3.

This strongly constrained and appropriately normed meta-GGA achieves remarkable accuracy for systems where the exact exchange-correlation hole is localized near its electron. and especially for lattice constants and weak interactions.,True,09nv75wAAAAJ:ns9cj8rnVeAC,1282,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.036402,8776859108789331840,/scholar?cites=8776859108789331840,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.03028,0,0,0
1096781,Electronic density functional theory: recent progress and new directions,2013,John F Dobson and Giovanni Vignale and Mukunda P Das,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,This book is an outcome of the International Workshop on Electronic Density Functional Theory. held at Griffith University in Brisbane. Australia. in July 1996. Density functional theory. standing as it does at the boundary between the disciplines of physics. chemistry. and materials science. is a great mixer. Invited experts from North America. Europe. and Australia mingled with students from several disciplines. rapidly taking up the informal style for which Australia is famous. A list of participants is given at the end of the book. Density functional theory (DFT) is a subtle approach to the very difficult problem of predicting the behavior of many interacting particles. A major application is the study of many-electron systems. This was the workshop theme. embracing inter alia computational chemistry and condensed matter physics. DFT circumvents the more conceptually straightforward (but more computationally intensive) approach in which one solves the many-body Schrodinger equation. It relies instead on rather delicate considerations involving the electron number density. For many years the pioneering work of Kohn and Sham (the Local Density Ap proximation of 1965 and immediate extensions) represented the state of the art in DFT. This approach was widely used for its appealing simplicity and computability. but gave rather modest accuracy. In the last few years there has been a renaissance of interest. quite largely due to the remarkable success of the new generation of gradient functionals whose initiators include invitees to the workshop (Perdew. Parr. Yang).,True,09nv75wAAAAJ:Azgs6IHzeyYC,1059,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=4OvvBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA3&dq=info:JvpvcRfDbv8J:scholar.google.com&ots=xVwtRMXKe9&sig=_7kgEFHD4qKzxU4pLeepPPt9WkA,18405863232564623910,/scholar?cites=18405863232564623910,,,0,0,0
1096782,Jacob’s ladder of density functional approximations for the exchange-correlation energy,2001,John P Perdew and Karla Schmidt,577,AIP Conference Proceedings,1,1-20,American Institute of Physics,The ground-state energy and density of a many-electron system are often calculated by Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We describe a ladder of approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density. At the lowest rung of this ladder. the contribution to the energy from a volume element of 3-dimensional space is determined by the local density there. Higher rungs or levels incorporate increasingly complex ingredients constructed from the density or the Kohn-Sham orbitals in or around this volume element. We identify which additional exact conditions can be satisfied at each level. and discuss the extent to which the functionals at each level may be constructed without empirical input. We also discuss the research that remains to be done at the exact-exchange level. and present our “dreams of a final theory.” “Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran.

Along a C2h cut of the PES. as the distance R between atomsC1 and C6 increases. the wave function changes from predominantly 1. 4-cyclohexanediyl to aromatic to predominantly bis-allyl. Most ab initio methods employing at least the 6-31G* basis set lead to the conclusion that the actual transition state is dominated by the “aromatic” combination of two resonance structures. the best estimates of the C1-C6 bond length being near 1.8 Å. 1. 2 Several experimental5-9 and. more recently. computational10-13 studies concern …,True,eZqrRYEAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,137,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja993375x,3088157016528084740,/scholar?cites=3088157016528084740,,https://www.thevespiary.org/library/Files_Uploaded_by_Users/Sedit/Journal%20of%20Chemical%20Education%20%28797Megs%29/web/JAC%20year%202000/ja993375x.pdf,0,0,0

The emphasis is on the general techniques of density functional design that have been particularly successful in quantum chemistry. Back in the 1960s. hopes for future progress in electronic structure theory were associated with correlated wave function techniques and the tantalizing possibility of variational calculations based on the two-electron reduced density matrix. Density functional theory (DFT) was not on the quantum chemistry agenda at that time. Meanwhile. approximate DFT has become the most widely used method of quantum chemistry. offering an unprecedented accuracy-to-cost ratio.

The stabilization of substituted structures along the cuts is discussed in terms of the energies of isodesmic formation from allyl radicals and acetonitrile molecules. Cyano groups at C1. C3. and C5 provide a nearly additive stabilization of each point along the Cs cut even though their influence on the geometry is competitive.

For most low-energy processes the Born-Oppenheimer fixed-nuclei approximation is sufficient: the nuclear motion takes place on an effective potential surface which is the sum of the electronic energy and the nuclear repulsion as a function of the nuclear coordinates. One of the main fields of quantum chemical activity is the study of these surfaces. Complete characterization of a multidimensional potential surface is a very complex task. Often. however. the nuclear motion takes place in the vicinity of a reference configuration. and the surface can be adequately characterized by a power series expansion. i.e.. by its derivatives with respect to the nuclear coordinates.

We present here an optimized version of this TPSS functional obtained by empirically fitting a single free parameter that controls the approach of the exchange enhancement factor to its rapidly-varying-density limit. while preserving all the exact constraints that the original TPSS functional satisfies. We find that molecular atomization energies are significantly improved with the optimized version and are even better than those obtained with the best hybrid functionals employing a fraction of exact exchange (eg. the TPSS hybrid). while energy barrier …,True,k8BMT_EAAAAJ:5nxA0vEk-isC,42,https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.76.042506,14405766043218614717,/scholar?cites=14405766043218614717,,http://web.inc.bme.hu/csonka/csg/reprints/PhysRevA_76_042506.pdf,0,0,0
1096862,Quantum stress focusing in descriptive chemistry,2008,Jianmin Tao and Giovanni Vignale and IV Tokatly,100,Physical review letters,20,206405,American Physical Society,We show that several important concepts of descriptive chemistry. such as atomic shells. bonding electron pairs. and lone electron pairs. may be described in terms of quantum stress focusing. ie. the spontaneous formation of high-pressure regions in an electron gas. This description subsumes previous mathematical constructions. such as the Laplacian of the density and the electron localization function. and provides a new tool for visualizing chemical structure. We also show that the full stress tensor. defined as the derivative of the energy with respect to a local deformation. can be easily calculated from density functional theory.,True,k8BMT_EAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,40,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.206405,5969060236703634156,/scholar?cites=5969060236703634156,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.2117,0,0,0

Tao and Mo developed a semilocal exchange-correlation density functional. The exchange part of this functional is derived from a density-matrix expansion corrected to reproduce the fourth-order gradient expansion of the exchange energy in the slowly-varying-density limit. while the correlation part is based on the Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) correlation functional. with a modification for the low-density limit. In the present paper. the Tao-Mo (TM) functional is assessed by computing various properties of solids and jellium surfaces. This includes 22 lattice constants and bulk moduli. 30 band gaps. seven cohesive energies. and jellium surface exchange and correlation energies for the density parameter r s in the range from 2 to 3 bohr.

1096864,Exchange energy density of an atom as a functional of the electron density,2001,Jianmin Tao,115,The Journal of Chemical Physics,8,3519-3530,American Institute of Physics,An electron-density functional for the conventionally defined exchange energy density of an atom is constructed using Becke’s inhomogeneity parameter QB based on the density matrix expansion of the exchange hole. The proposed functional (the energy density meta-generalized gradient approximation or EDMGGA) has the following properties: (i) The exchange energy density εxEDMGGA(r) has correct nuclear cusp and density-tail behaviors. (ii) The corresponding exchange potential δEx[n]/δn(r) is finite near the nucleus and decays asymptotically as −k/r in the tail. Numerical results show that our functional yields total exchange energies for atoms with about the same accuracy as Becke’s widely used functional B88. but significantly improves the local description of the exchange energy density.

In the present work. the capability of the adiabatic nonempirical meta–generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) of Tao. Perdew.

For example. near-term CCS technology applied to coal-fired power plants is projected to reduce the net output of the plant by some 30% and to increase the cost of electricity by 60–80%. Developing capture materials and processes that reduce the parasitic energy imposed by CCS is therefore an important area of research. We have developed a computational approach to rank adsorbents for their performance in CCS. Using this analysis. we have screened hundreds of thousands of zeolite and zeolitic imidazolate framework structures and identified many different structures that have the potential to reduce the parasitic energy of CCS by 30–40% compared with near-term technologies.,True,oqf62l8AAAAJ:GiYFt9mpioMC,480,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3336,15171854560783433234,/scholar?cites=15171854560783433234,,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200777/files/nmat3336.pdf,0,0,0

In addition to academic interest in this debate. there is an industrial motivation for better understanding of bonding in f-element complexes due to the need to separate trivalent trans-plutonium elements from trivalent lanthanide fission products in advanced nuclear fuel cycles. This review discusses the key evidence for covalency in f-element bonds derived from structural. spectroscopic and theoretical studies of some selected classes of molecules. including octahedral hexahalides. linear actinyl and organometallic sandwich complexes.

The admixture of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange is controlled by three parameters: short-range mixing. long-range mixing. and range separation. We study how the variation of these parameters affects the accuracy of hybrid functionals for thermochemistry and kinetics. For the density functional component of the hybrids. we test three nonempirical approximations: local spin-density approximation. generalized gradient approximation (GGA). and meta-GGA. We find a great degree of flexibility in choosing the mixing parameters in range-separated hybrids. For the studied properties. short-range and long-range HF exchange seem to have a similar effect on the errors.

However. it has been shown that this orbital-based self-interaction correction (SIC) tends to overcorrect and often impairs molecular properties. We have recently proposed a method to improve the performance of the SIC by scaling it down in many-electron regions. In this communication. we present a simplification of this scheme. For every occupied orbital. we introduce a scaling factor determined by the ratio of the orbital density to the total spin-density. Thus. the magnitude of the correction is adjusted depending on how much orbital densities overlap with one another. Such a modification of the Perdew-Zunger SIC does not add any appreciable time to the computation. but significantly improves the accuracy for a number of benchmark properties.,True,z77_jNwAAAAJ:hqOjcs7Dif8C,40,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2204599,11756687877948029124,/scholar?cites=11756687877948029124,,,0,0,0

By virtue of its full nonlocality. RPA correlation is compatible with exact Hartree–Fock-type exchange and describes van der Waals interactions exceptionally well [B. G. Janesko et al.. J. Chem.

Their electronic properties can be either metallic or semiconducting depending purely on morphology. but predicting their electronic behavior has proven challenging. The combination of experimental efforts with modeling of these nanometer-scale structures has been instrumental in gaining insight into their physical and chemical properties and the processes involved at these scales. Particularly. approximations based on density functional theory have emerged as a successful computational tool for predicting the electronic structure of these materials.

An “M-electron self-interaction-free” functional for positive integer M is one that produces a realistic linear variation of total energy with N in the range of M−1<N⩽M. and so can avoid these errors.

1097026,An improved algorithm for reaction path following,1989,Carlos Gonzalez and H Bernhard Schlegel,90,The Journal of Chemical Physics,4,2154-2161,American Institute of Physics,A new algorithm is presented for obtaining points on a steepest descent path from the transition state of the reactants and products. In mass‐weighted coordinates. this path corresponds to the intrinsic reaction coordinate. Points on the reaction path are found by constrained optimizations involving all internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The points are optimized so that the segment of the reaction path between any two adjacent points is given by an arc of a circle. and so that the gradient at each point is tangent to the path. Only the transition vector and the energy gradients are needed to construct the path. The resulting path is continuous. differentiable and piecewise quadratic. In the limit of small step size. the present algorithm is shown to take a step with the correct tangent vector and curvature vector; hence. it is a second order algorithm.

1097028,Optimization of equilibrium geometries and transition structures,1982,H Bernhard Schlegel,3,Journal of Computational Chemistry,2,214-218,John Wiley & Sons. Inc.,A modified conjugate gradient algorithm for geometry optimization is outlined for use with ab initio MO methods. Since the computation time for analytical energy gradients is approximately the same as for the energy. the optimization algorithm evaluates and utilizes the gradients each time the energy is computed. The second derivative matrix. rather than its inverse. is updated employing the gradients. At each step. a one‐dimensional minimization using a quartic polynomial is carried out. followed by an n‐dimensional search using the second derivative matrix. By suitably controlling the number of negative eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix. the algorithm can also be used to locate transition structures.

Inc.,A redundant internal coordinate system for optimizing molecular geometries is constructed from all bonds. all valence angles between bonded atoms. and all dihedral angles between bonded atoms. Redundancies are removed by using the generalized inverse of the G matrix; constraints can be added by using an appropriate projector. For minimizations. redundant internal coordinates provide substantial improvements in optimization efficiency over Cartesian and nonredundant internal coordinates. especially for flexible and polycyclic systems. Transition structure searches are also improved when redundant coordinates are used and when the initial steps are guided by the quadratic synchronous transit approach. © 1996 by John Wiley & Sons.

Unfortunately. a spin unrestricted wave function can contain large contributions from unwanted spin states that can distort the potential energy surface significantly.

As is well known. the spin project unrestricted Hartree–Fock bond dissociation curves have a large kink at the onset of the UHF/RHF instability. and a spurious minimum just beyond. However. the spurious minimum disappears and the kink is very much less pronounced at the unrestricted Mo/ller–Plesset level with spin projection.

In this paper. we show that at least for the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid. this is not the case; for many properties improved by long-range-correction. screened hybrids and global hybrids deliver essentially the same results.

This unexpected result is here rationalized by observing that band energy differences obtained from generalized Kohn–Sham calculations with screened (short-range) Hartree–Fock–type exchange approach the excitation energies obtained via time-dependent density functional calculations with the corresponding unscreened functional.

The current hardware can perform only projective single-qubit measurements. and thus. the Hamiltonian expectation value is obtained by measuring parts of the Hamiltonian rather than the full Hamiltonian. This restriction makes the measurement process inefficient because the number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows as O(N4) with the size of the system. N. To optimize the VQE measurement. one can try to group as many Hamiltonian terms as possible for their simultaneous measurement.

Local analysis of a two-dimensional linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model Hamiltonian near the CI shows that the role of the GP is twofold. First. it compensates for a repulsion created by the so-called diagonal Born–Oppenheimer correction. Second. the GP enhances the non-adiabatic transition probability for a wave-packet part that experiences a central collision with the CI. To assess the significance of both GP contributions we propose two indicators that can be computed from parameters of electronic surfaces and initial conditions.

One of the typical scenarios of the BOA breakdown in molecules beyond diatomics is a conical intersection (CI) of electronic potential energy surfaces. CIs provide an efficient mechanism for radiationless electronic transitions: acting as “funnels” for the nuclear wave function. they enable rapid conversion of the excessive electronic energy into the nuclear motion. In addition. CIs introduce nontrivial geometric phases (GPs) for both electronic and nuclear wave functions.

We study GP effects in nuclear dynamics of an N-dimensional linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model. The main impact of GP on low-energy nuclear dynamics is reduction of population transfer between the local minima of the LVC lower energy surface. For the LVC model. we proposed an isometric coordinate transformation that confines non-adiabatic effects within a two-dimensional subsystem interacting with an N − 2 dimensional environment. Since environmental modes do not couple electronic states. all GP effects originate from nuclear dynamics within the subsystem.

Theory Comput.,4,2400-2409,,The Variational Quantum Eigensolver approach to the electronic structure problem on a quantum computer involves measurement of the Hamiltonian expectation value. Formally. quantum mechanics allows one to measure all mutually commuting or compatible operators simultaneously. Unfortunately. the current hardware permits measuring only a much more limited subset of operators that share a common tensor product eigen-basis. We introduce unitary transformations that transform any fully commuting group of operators to a group that can be measured on current hardware. These unitary operations can be encoded as a sequence of Clifford gates and let us not only measure much larger groups of terms but also to obtain these groups efficiently on a classical computer.

Ryabinkin,10,Chemical Science,,3746 - 3755,,Current implementations of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) technique for solving the electronic structure problem involve splitting the system qubit Hamiltonian into parts whose elements commute within their single qubit subspaces. The number of such parts rapidly grows with the size of the molecule. This increases the computational cost and can increase uncertainty in the measurement of the energy expectation value because elements from different parts need to be measured independently. To address this problem we introduce a more efficient partitioning of the qubit Hamiltonian using fewer parts that need to be measured separately.

Our computations suggest that edges. steps and reliefs of all the layered modifications of TiCl3 should behave similarly in providing active sites; polymerization should occur on these more exposed sites because of the much lower activation energies than for plain surfaces. A unique general model emerges: lower steric repulsions appear to be implied for a coordination of the polymeric chain on the more hindered octahedral position at a titanium atom and this. in turn. causes a chiral orientation of the first carbon-carbon bond of the chain.

CC theory is a “correct bosonization” in the sense that the wavefunction and Hilbert space are exactly fermionic. yet the amplitude equations can be interpreted as adding different quasibosonic RPA channels together.

These results demonstrate that the polarizability per atom of a nanotube in the axial direction is primarily determined by the band gap. In fact. polarizability per atom versus inverse band gap yields a linear trend for all nanotubes and methods utilized in this study. creating a universal relationship for longitudinal polarizability. This can be explained by examining the terms in the sum over states equation used to determine polarizability and noting that the vast majority of the polarizability arises from a few elements near the band gap.

ZIF-8 is used as the original framework for alterations of different metal substitutes of the Zn2+ metal. ZIF-8 consists of cages connected by narrow apertures that exhibit flexibility through “swelling”. allowing for relatively large penetrants to diffuse. Replacing the central metal atom in the basic tetrahedral unit of ZIF-8 with Cd. Co or Be results in three different structures with increasing bonding stiffness with their neighboring atoms. The metal modification approach offers a way to control the flexibility and the size of the aperture. which constitutes the main energy barrier of the penetrant's hop-like diffusion between the framework's cages. Newly developed force fields are reported and utilized here; the new frameworks are compared to the …,True,Wyb8B4wAAAAJ:Y5dfb0dijaUC,21,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2018/cp/c7cp08456k,7064519657702339771,/scholar?cites=7064519657702339771,,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b25/9bdd7ef1727e12bce607dc2ada3b4b0f1081.pdf,0,0,0

The behavior of the nickel bis(dithiolene) complex Ni(S2C2(CF3)2)2 (1_Ni) as an electrocatalyst for this process was thoroughly explored experimentally and computationally.

Test calculations on the benzene dimer reproduced the results obtained by using localized basis set. provided that the latter are corrected for the basis set superposition error. By applying the DFT‐D/plane‐wave approach a substantial agreement with experiments is found for the structure and energetics of polyethylene and graphite. two typical solids that are badly described by standard local and semilocal density functionals. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals.

Anharmonic corrections cannot be neglected for quantitative studies. but can be obtained quite effectively by a perturbative treatment including cubic force constants to the second order and semidiagonal quartic constants to the first order. Simple finite difference equations provide all the necessary terms by at most 6N-11 Hessian evaluations. where N is the number of atoms in the system. Accurate values are obtained by this method using the Becke three parameter Lee–Yang–Parr functional. medium size basis sets. and. when needed. proper treatment of internal rotations.

Our new approach has the advantage of leading to an O(N) computational scheme in the large system limit. Our implementation is based on atom-centered Gaussian orbitals. which are especially suited to deal effectively with general molecular systems.

Including a tensorial fictitious mass facilitates the use of larger time steps for the dynamics process. A rigorous analysis of energy conservation is presented and used to control the deviation of the fictitious dynamics trajectory from the corresponding Born–Oppenheimer dynamics trajectory.

It was found in our model that the hydrated excess proton displays a marked preference for water liquid/vapor interfaces. The resulting stable surface structures can be explained through an examination of the bond network formed between the water/proton moiety and solvating water. These results suggest the excess proton can effectively behave as an amphiphile. displaying both hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. ,True,2i-EEtYAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC,286,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp046716o,5809707124802006664,/scholar?cites=5809707124802006664,,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.469.8204&rep=rep1&type=pdf,0,0,0

The unified and single-valued ONIOM expressions for the energy and energy derivatives allow for an implementation of conservative dynamics.

These structures occur naturally in the form of Au-coated Au 2 S nanoparticles. During the course of nanoparticle growth. the plasmon-related absorption peak undergoes very large shifts in wavelength. from∼ 650 to∼ 900 nm. We show that this plasmon peak shift is purely classical in origin and is determined solely by the relative thickness of the Au shell and the Au 2 S core diameter.

This dielectric core−metallic shell prolate spheroid nanoparticle bears a remarkable resemblance to a grain of rice. inspiring the name “nanorice”. This geometry possesses far greater structural tunability than either a nanorod or a nanoshell. along with much larger local field intensity enhancements and far greater sensitivity as a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) nanosensor than any dielectric−metal nanostructures reported previously. Invoking the plasmon hybridization picture allows us to understand the plasmon resonances of this geometry. as arising from a hybridization of the primitive plasmons of a solid spheroid and an ellipsoidal cavity inside a continuous metal. ,True,nd8O1XQAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C,854,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl060209w,2282973592085460864,/scholar?cites=2282973592085460864,,https://www.academia.edu/download/45276843/Nanorice_A_Hybrid_Plasmonic_Nanostructur20160502-119586-5qe5ks.pdf,0,0,0

In Zambia. the morbidity and mortality due to TB remains high. despite extended public health attempts to control the epidemic and to diminish stigma.   Study Aim To enhance understanding of TB-related stigmatizing perceptions and to describe TB patients’ experiences of stigma in order to point out recommendations to improve TB policy.   Methods We conducted a mixed method study at Kanyama clinic and surrounding areas. in Lusaka. Zambia; structured interviews with 300 TB patients. multiple in-depth interviews with 30 TB patients and 10 biomedical health workers. 3 focus group discussions with TB patients and treatment supporters. complemented by participant observation and policy analysis of the TB control program. Predictors of stigma were identified by use of multivariate regression analyses; qualitative analysis of the in-depth interviews. focus group discussions and participant observation was used for triangulation of the study findings.   Results We focused on the 138/300 patients that described TB-related perceptions and attitudes. of whom 113 (82%) reported stigma.

Using studies conducted in the 1990s. the authors compare the age-and sex-specific prevalence of dementia. AD. and vascular dementia (VaD) across European population-based studies of persons 65 years and older. Data from these studies were also pooled to obtain stable estimates of age-and sex-specific prevalence. A total of 2346 cases of mild to severe dementia were identified in 11 cohorts. Age-standardized prevalence was 6.4% for dementia (all causes). 4.4% for AD. and 1.6% for VaD. The prevalence of dementia increased continuously with age and was 0.8% in the group age 65 to 69 years and 28.5% at age 90 years and older. The corresponding figures for AD (53.7% of cases) were 0.6% and 22.2%. and for VaD (15.8% of cases). 0.3% and 5.2%. Variation of AD prevalence across studies was greatest for men. In the VaD subtype. a large variation across studies was observed. as well as a difference in prevalence between men and women that was age dependent. Dementia is more prevalent in women. and AD is the main contributor to the steep increase of prevalence with age.Ten years ago. we published a collaborative study of population-based studies conducted in the 1980s. 1-3 Although all studies were based on face-toface interviews and used internationally accepted diagnostic guidelines. they were based on small samples and used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 3rd ed.(DSM-III) criteria.

Incidence data from eight population-based studies carried out in seven European countries were compared and pooled. The pooled data included 835 mild to severe dementia cases and 42.996 person-years of follow-up. In all studies a higher proportion of cases were diagnosed with AD (60 to 70% of all demented cases) than vascular dementia (VaD). The incidence of dementia and AD continued to increase with age up to age 85 years. after which rates increased in women but not men. There was a large variation in VaD incidence across studies. In the pooled analysis. the incidence rates increased with age without any substantial difference between men and women. Surprisingly. higher incidence rates of dementia and AD were found in the very old in northwest countries than in southern countries. This study confirms that AD is the most frequent dementing disorder in all ages. and that there is a higher incidence of dementia. specifically AD. in women than men among the very old.

METHODS: Light microscopic. computer-aided. morphometric quantitative analysis. RESULTS: In ten decades. Bruch's membrane thickness increased by 135%. from 2.0 to 4.7 microns; the choriocapillary density decreased by 45%; the diameter of the choriocapillaris decreased by 34%. from 9.8 to 6.5 microns; and the choroidal thickness decreased by 57%. from 193.5 to 84 microns in normal maculae.

Age was also the strongest factor related to choriocapillary density (rs=-0.58). In advanced stages of age-related macular degeneration. the decrease in choriocapillary density and diameter was significantly larger than in normal maculae. but the thickness of the choroid and Bruch's membrane was the same.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE). the major apolipoprotein of the CNS and an important regulator of cholesterol and lipid transport. appears to be associated with neurodegeneration. The apoE gene (APOE) polymorphism is a strong risk factor for various neurodegenerative diseases. and the apoE protein has been demonstrated in disease-associated lesions of these disorders. Hypothesizing that variants of APOE act as a potential risk factor for AMD. we performed a genetic-association study among 88 AMD cases and 901 controls derived from the population-based Rotterdam Study in the Netherlands.

1097426,Overview of work disability in rheumatoid arthritis patients as observed in cross‐sectional and longitudinal surveys,2004,SMM Verstappen and JWJ Bijlsma and H Verkleij and E Buskens and AAM Blaauw and EJ Ter Borg and JWG Jacobs and Utrecht Rheumatoid Arthritis Cohort Study Group,51,,3,488-497,Wiley Subscription Services. Inc.. A Wiley Company,Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling condition with. among other things. negative social and economic consequences for both the individual patient and society. Striking economic consequences are the diminished ability to perform the current job (ie. the same occupation or the same number of hours) or even work disability. Costs directly ensuing from work disability account for a large part of the total RA-related costs (1). Over the past decades. a number of studies have been published reporting on work disability. In general. the percentage of patients that becomes work disabled during the course of the disease is high. although rates between studies differ. This may be attributable to differences in definition of work disability. study design. population. mean disease duration or length of followup. flexibility of labor market at the time of study. and maybe most importantly. differences in social security systems across the different countries. Regardless of the variability in study designs. it is of interest to identify the risk factors found in the studies. Potentially modifiable risk factors might be influenced early in the course of disease. This overview has 3 purposes: 1) to summarize percentages of work disability in patients with RA. as measured cross-sectionally or longitudinally. 2) to see which sociodemographic characteristics. clinical variables. or workrelated factors are associated with work disability or are predictors of work disability; and 3) to compare rates of work disability in groups of RA patients with the countryspecific rates of the general population.,True,DNB6CcIAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C,275,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erik_Buskens/publication/8519435_Overview_of_work_disability_in_rheumatoid_arthritis_patients_as_observed_in_cross-sectional_and_longitudinal_surveys/links/5a74241a0f7e9b20d49081c6/Overview-of-work-disability-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients-as-observed-in-cross-sectional-and-longitudinal-surveys.pdf,14741669538742171851,/scholar?cites=14741669538742171851,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erik_Buskens/publication/8519435_Overview_of_work_disability_in_rheumatoid_arthritis_patients_as_observed_in_cross-sectional_and_longitudinal_surveys/links/5a74241a0f7e9b20d49081c6/Overview-of-work-disability-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-patients-as-observed-in-cross-sectional-and-longitudinal-surveys.pdf,0,0,0

In the present study. three fragments of the truncated S protein were expressed in E. coli. and analyzed with pooled sera of convalescence phase of SARS patients. The full length S gene DNA vaccine was constructed and used to immunize BALB/c mice. The mouse serum IgG antibody against SARS-CoV was measured by ELISA with E. coli expressed truncated S protein or SARS-CoV lysate as diagnostic antigen. The results showed that all the three fragments of S protein expressed by E. coli was able to react with sera of SARS patients and the S gene DNA candidate vaccine could induce the production of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV efficiently in mice with seroconversion ratio of 75% after 3 times of immunization.

However. because the risk of CVD is still representing a challenge in spite of prevention and all treatment efforts. there is a need for new pathophysiological models for better understanding of cardiovascular risk and its treatment. based on new concepts. It has been shown that target organ damage (TOD) represents a mediating step between risk factors and CVD events.

In designing a RCT with CIMT as a primary outcome. several ultrasound options may be considered. We discuss the various options and provide a pooled estimate of CIMT progression. In addition. we quantify the effect of these choices on the sample size for a RCT.Summary of Comment— To estimate the average CIMT progression rate. we performed a pooled analysis using CIMT progression rates of control groups from published RCTs. The pros and cons of the following ultrasound options are discussed: which arterial segments may be studied; whether near and far wall CIMT measurements should be performed; whether a single image (1 angle of interrogation) or multiple images (more angles of interrogation) should be used; whether a …,True,koN779YAAAAJ:SP6oXDckpogC,457,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.STR.0000102044.27905.B5,7981835073877283633,/scholar?cites=7981835073877283633,,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.str.0000102044.27905.b5,0,0,0

A biracial population of 8772 adults (aged 48 to 72 years) living in 4 communities was examined from 1993 to 1995 were studied for that purpose. Retinal arteriovenous nicking and focal arteriolar narrowing were determined by light-box grading of a 45° fundus photograph by use of a standardized protocol. Diameters of arterioles and venules were measured in digitized photographs. and a summary arteriolar-to-venular ratio was derived as an index of generalized arteriolar narrowing. Focal arteriolar narrowing was associated only with hypertension.
