Here we report that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine inhibits HMGB1 release from human macrophages by signaling through a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Nicotine. a selective cholinergic agonist. is more efficient than acetylcholine and inhibits HMGB1 release induced by either endotoxin or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Nicotinic stimulation prevents activation of the NF-κB pathway and inhibits HMGB1 secretion through a specific'nicotinic anti-inflammatory pathway'that requires the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR).

It is released passively during cell injury and necrosis. and secreted actively by immune cells. HMGB1 contains three conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues: C23 and C45 can form an intramolecular disulfide bond. whereas C106 is unpaired and is essential for the interaction with Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 4. However. a comprehensive characterization of the dynamic redox states of each cysteine residue and of their impacts on innate immune responses is lacking. Using tandem mass spectrometric analysis. we now have established that the C106 thiol and the C23-C45 disulfide bond are required for HMGB1 to induce nuclear NF-κB translocation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in macrophages. Both irreversible oxidation to sulphonates and complete reduction to thiols of these cysteines inhibited TNF production markedly. In a proof of concept murine model of hepatic necrosis induced by acetaminophen. during inflammation. the predominant form of serum HMGB1 is the active one. containing a C106 thiol group and a disulfide bond between C23 and C45. whereas the inactive form of HMGB1. containing terminally oxidized cysteines. accumulates during inflammation resolution and hepatic regeneration.

In this study. we investigated whether MIF expression was associated with clinicopathologic features of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). especially in tumors with hepatic metastasis. and whether neutralization of endogenous MIF using anti-MIF therapeutics would inhibit tumor growth and/or decrease the frequency of colorectal hepatic metastases in a mouse colon carcinoma model. The concentration of serum MIF was positively correlated with an increased risk of hepatic metastasis in human patients with CRC (R = 1.25. 95% confidence internal = 1.02–1.52. P = 0.03).

The kinetically controlled. boron‐mediated aldol reaction is particularly powerful for the efficient synthesis of β‐hydroxy carbonyl compounds. Compared to other metal enolates. the boron–oxygen bond in boron enolates is relatively short which. on addition to aldehydes. leads to tight cyclic transition states and highly stereoselective carbon–carbon bond formation. Moreover. variation of the steric demands of the ligands on boron allows discrimination between competing transition states.

Several experimental hints point to defect migration as a plausible mechanism underlying such anomalous properties. Here we present an experimental and theoretical investigation combining measurements of PL rise dynamics at varying temperatures with first principles computational modeling of defect migration under light irradiation. We propose a model in which light irradiation promotes the annihilation of VI+/Ii− Frenkel pairs. which we show to be relatively abundant in polycrystalline MAPbI3. This partly restores a non-defective crystalline environment and eliminates the trapping centers associated with such defect pairs. The PL rise time dynamics at varying temperature provide an activation energy consistent with that calculated for …,True,frrxchwAAAAJ:35N4QoGY0k4C,220,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2016/ee/c6ee01504b,9441557371736345405,/scholar?cites=9441557371736345405,,,0,0,0

CsPbCl3:Mn-based quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized and applied onto the front side of the perovskite solar cells as the energy-down-shift (EDS) layer. It is found that with very high quantum yield (∼60%) and larger Stokes shift (>200 nm). the CsPbCl3:Mn QDs effectively convert the normally wasted energy in the UV region (300–400 nm) into usable visible light at ∼590 nm for enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE). Meanwhile. conversion of the UV rays eliminated a significant loss mechanism that deteriorates perovskite stability. As a result. external quantum efficiency in the UV region is significantly increased. leading to an increased short …,True,FWTiewsAAAAJ:ipzZ9siozwsC,149,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsenergylett.7b00375,13956365862743139330,/scholar?cites=13956365862743139330,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rajan_Singh27/post/What-are-the-measurements-to-be-done-for-studying-phosphorescence-in-hybrid-perovskite-systems/attachment/5a9d570ab53d2f0bba5604d8/AS%3A600831804055552%401520260873923/download/acsenergylett.7b00375.pdf,0,0,0

The conversion of renewable resources into either clean fuels or chemicals is attracting growing interest because of the continuous reduction of fossil hydrocarbon supplies.[1] Depending on the starting biomassbased material fuel production is either sustainable. or not. First-generation biofuels essentially comprise ethanol and biodiesel. obtained from sugar fermentation and transesterification of animal fats or vegetable oils. respectively. Unfortunately. the long-term production of these biofuels is not sustainable because it can seriously compromise both food supplies and biodiversity. The use of biomasses that consist of the residual nonfood parts of current crops represents a challenging goal for the production of second-generation biofuels. starting from the extraction of complex molecules (lignin or cellulose) from woods or fibrous biomasses. To this purpose. several catalytic processes for the production of useful chemicals and feedstocks via hydrolysis of lignocellulose residues have been already investigated.[2] Finally. third-generation biofuels can be produced from marine biomasses. such as algae. with higher energy balances than those obtained from land crops. Hydrogen plays an important role in this context. In fact. hydrogen is not only a fundamental chemical for important industrial processes but it is also considered an attractive and clean energy vector for fuel-cell technology.[1] Nowadays. hydrogen is mostly used for the purification of fuel by removing sulfur and nitrogen (HDS and HDN processes). ammonia synthesis. cracking …,True,MhwlHXIAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,62,https://www.academia.edu/download/41895220/Renewable_H2_from_Glycerol_Steam_Reformi20160202-30232-sgmod5.pdf,18420888281363887292,/scholar?cites=18420888281363887292,,https://www.academia.edu/download/41895220/Renewable_H2_from_Glycerol_Steam_Reformi20160202-30232-sgmod5.pdf,0,0,0

Among the pressing uncertainties surrounding this event is the fate of ∼2 million barrels of submerged oil thought to have been trapped in deep-ocean intrusion layers at depths of ∼1.000–1.300 m. Here we use chemical distributions of hydrocarbons in >3.000 sediment samples from 534 locations to describe a footprint of oil deposited on the deep-ocean floor. Using a recalcitrant biomarker of crude oil. 17α(H).21β(H)-hopane (hopane). we have identified a 3.200-km2 region around the Macondo Well contaminated by ∼1.8 ± 1.0 × 106 g of excess hopane.

I received the 1964 annual award from the French Textile Chemical Society (ACIT) for works performed on linear organic polymers. I did not imagine that the major part of my scientific career would be conducted outside of the field of organic chemistry [1]. Until 1972. I had been involved in researches dealing with organic binders for foundries. synthetic textile fibers. natural and synthetic leather. collagen. and organic membranes [2-3]. In the aftermath of various catastrophic fires in France between 1970-73. which involved common organic plastic. research on nonflammable and noncombustible plastic materials became my objective. I founded a private research company in 1972. which is today called CORDI-GÉOPOLYMÈRE. In my pursuit to develop new inorganic polymer materials.

1099748,High-alkali cements for 21st century concretes,1994,J Davidovits,144,Special Publication,,383-398,,Recent literature suggests that there is considemble potential for reduction in the emission of C02 to the environment through the manufacture of new types of cement which do not rely on the calcination of limestone (and accompanying release of C02). The 1988 one billion metric tonnes world-wide production of cement accounted for one billion metric tonnes of C02 release. ie 5% of the 1988 world C02 emission (human activity only). This is equivalent to the C02 emission by the entire Japanese activity. The use of lesser amounts of calcium-based cements could be achieved through their pm1ial replacement by alkaliactivated alumino-silicate materials. which do not release large quantities of C02 in their manufacture. The fostering of low-C02 high-alkali-based cements will mean a dramatic change in the research and development presently carried out in USA and other countries.

1099832,carbon onions for electrochemical energy storage,2016,Marco Zeiger and Nicolas Jäckel and Vadym N Mochalin and Volker Presser,4,,9,3172-3196,Royal Society of Chemistry,Carbon onions are a relatively new member of the carbon nanomaterials family. They consist of multiple concentric fullerene-like carbon shells which are highly defective and disordered. Due to their small size of typically below 10 nm. the large external surface area. and high conductivity they are used for supercapacitor applications. As electrode materials. carbon onions provide fast charge/discharge rates resulting in high specific power but present comparatively low specific energy. They improve the performance of activated carbon electrodes as conductive additives and show suitable properties as substrates for redox-active materials. This review provides a critical discussion of the electrochemical properties of different types of carbon onions as electrode materials.

A reduction in crystal size also affects ND Raman spectra. The confinement of optical phonons in nanocrystals (< 10 nm) results in asymmetrically broadened Raman lines. which are shifted toward lower wavenumbers. The phonon confinement model (PCM) relates the observed changes in the Raman spectra to the crystal size and can be used for size characterization at the nanoscale. While the PCM was successfully applied to a variety of materials including Si and BN. results remained unsatisfactory in the case of ND.

Today activated carbon is a well-established. commercially available catalyst support [2]. It is used predominantly for precious metal catalysts (see. for example.

However. very few large-volume catalytic processes currently use carbon-supported catalysts. despite the steady research in some promising areas such as hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of petroleum fractions or hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. Consequently. a very small fraction of carbon production is destined for catalyst manufacturing.

CO/H2 or C2H4/H2) over a silica-supported nickel catalyst and an unsupported nickel catalyst at 550 °C. It turns out that both the nickel particle size and the nature of the carbon-containing gas significantly affects the CNF growth process. We demonstrate that at the chosen temperature small supported nickel particles need a carbon-containing gas with a relatively low reactivity. like CH4 or CO/H2. to produce CNF. The resulting fishbone CNF have a uniform and small diameter (25 nm). The CNF thus synthesized hold great potential. e.g. as catalyst support material. However. the large unsupported nickel particles only produce CNF using a reactive carbon-containing gas. like C2H4/H2.

The graphite-like structure of the treated fibers remained intact. however. the specific surface area and the pore volume increased with the severity of oxidation treatment. For the first time it is shown that the most predominant effect that gives rise to these textural modifications is the opening of the inner tubes of the fibers. Moreover. it is demonstrated that both the total oxygen content (O/C=0.02–0.07 at/at) as well as the number of acidic groups (1–3 nm−2) are a function of the type of oxidizing agent used and the treatment time.

The high ratios of CH4 : CO2 were used in an attempt to accelerate deactivation of the catalyst and make a faster comparison of the different samples. The addition of Ce resulted in a significant improvement in the stability. with no decrease in either CH4 or CO2 conversion observed. The promotion with La also resulted in an increase in the stability of the catalyst as well as an increase in the initial activity. The mechanism of reaction has been studied on the promoted catalysts. and it has been shown that it is not altered by the presence of the promoters.

Methane is decomposed on the metal to CHx(average value of x=2) and H2. The main route to CO2reduction occurs via initial formation of carbonate close to the metal-support boundary. Carbon on the metal reduces that carbonate to formate by forming CO. The formate decomposes rapidly to CO and a surface hydroxyl group.

Methane decomposes to carbon and hydrogen. forming carbon on the oxide support and the metal. Carbon on the metal is reactive and can be oxidized to CO by oxygen from dissociatively adsorbed CO2. For noble metals this reaction is fast. leading to low coke accumulation on the metal particles. The rate of carbon formation on the support is proportional to the concentration of Lewis acid sites.

It is also administered in the treatment of osteoporosis. 1 While the beneficial effects of fluoride are well documented. chronic exposure to high levels of this anion can lead to dental or even skeletal fluorosis. 2-4 Taking into account these adverse effects. a great deal of attention has been devoted to the discovery of improved analytical methods for the detection of fluoride. especially in water. This field of research has also been stimulated by the potential use of such methods for the detection of phosphorofluoridate nerve agents such as Sarin or uranium hexafluoride. which release fluoride upon hydrolysis.

Fluoride is found in drinking water. toothpaste. and osteoporosis drugs. In addition. fluoride ions also can be detected as an indicator of uranium enrichment (via hydrolysis of UF6) or of the chemical warfare agent sarin. which releases the ion upon hydrolysis. However. because of its high hydration enthalpy. the fluoride anion is one of the most challenging targets for anion recognition.Among the various recognition strategies that are available. researchers have focused a great deal of attention on Lewis acidic boron compounds.

Structural and photophysical studies carried out in solution and in the solid state indicate that 2 is a highly selective and sensitive phosphorescent fluoride sensor. The proximity of the two Lewis acidic sites enforced by the 1.8-naphthalenediyl backbone promotes fluoride anion chelation and is. therefore. responsible for the high binding constant.

A central aspect of our approach lies in the decoration of the boranes with peripheral ammonium. phosphonium. sulfonium stibonium or telluronium groups. The presence of these cationic groups provides a Coulombic drive for the capture of the anion. leading to boranes that can be used in aqueous solutions where anion hydration and/or protonation are usually competitive. The anion affinity of these boranes can be markedly enhanced by narrowing the separation between the anion binding site (i.e. the boron atom) and the onium ion. In such systems. the latent Lewis acidity of the onium ion also plays a role as manifested by …,True,s8VXnf0AAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,108,https://pubs.rsc.org/lv/content/articlehtml/2013/dt/c3dt50491c,1758221608480139411,/scholar?cites=1758221608480139411,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haiyan_Zhao/publication/236228135_Anion_capture_and_sensing_with_cationic_boranes_On_the_synergy_of_Coulombic_effects_and_onium_ion-centred_Lewis_acidity/links/54b535240cf2318f0f97309b.pdf,0,0,0

More and more new nanomaterials are being developed for this purpose. with improved heat-generating properties in solution. However. although the ultimate target of these treatments is the tumor cell. the heating efficiency. and the underlying mechanisms. are rarely studied in the cellular environment. Here we attempt to fill this gap by making systematic measurements of both hyperthermia and magnetism in controlled cell environments. using a wide range of nanomaterials. In particular. we report a systematic fall in the heating efficiency for nanomaterials associated with tumour cells. Real-time measurements showed that this loss of heat-generating power occurred very rapidly. within a matter of minutes.

To synthesize such nanorods. first “dot-in-a-rod” CdSe(dot)/CdS(rod) core/shell nanocrystals were prepared. Then a ZnS shell was grown epitaxially over these CdSe/CdS nanorods. which led to a fluorescence quantum yield of the final core−shell−shell nanorods that could be as high as 75%. The quantum efficiency was correlated with the aspect ratio of the nanorods and with the thickness of the ZnS shell around the starting CdSe/CdS rods. which varied from 1 to 4 monolayers (as supported by a combination of X-ray diffraction. elemental analysis with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis).

Excised pieces of several fruit and vegetable species were exposed to 83 kJ m-2 day-1 of biologically effective ultraviolet B irradiance (UV-BBE) for 10−12 days to induce cellular oxidation. The LOOH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) concentrations of these plant tissues were assessed with the FOX and iodometric assays for the former and a modified TBARS assay for the latter. There was generally good agreement between the FOX and iodometric methods both prior to and following the UV exposure. However. the iodometric assay appeared to have some difficulty in consistently quantifying lower LOOH levels (<11 μM). whereas the FOX assay measured LOOH concentrations as low as 5 μM.

Although the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to latently infected cells is well characterized. very little is known about T cell controls over lytic infection; this imbalance in our understanding belies the importance of virus-replicative lesions in several aspects of EBV disease pathogenesis. The present work shows that the primary CD8+ CTL response to EBV in infectious mononucleosis patients contains multiple lytic antigen-specific reactivities at levels at least as high as those seen against latent antigens; similar reactivities are also detectable in CTL memory.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016. Pair production of T quarks would result in a wide range of final states. since vector-like T quarks of charge 2e/3 are predicted to decay to bW. tZ. and tH. Likewise. vector-like B quarks are predicted to decay to tW. bZ. and bH. Three channels are considered. corresponding to final states with a single lepton. two leptons with the same sign of the electric charge. or at least three leptons. The results exclude T quarks with masses below 1140–1300 GeV and B quarks with masses below 910–1240 GeV for various branching fraction combinations. extending the reach of previous CMS searches by 200–600 GeV.,True,q9jamNwAAAAJ:K1AqHrCRkPsC,101,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP08(2018)177,882647326392021420,/scholar?cites=882647326392021420,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP08(2018)177,0,0,0

India,2004,Balkrishna Bhika Yeole and A Venkata Ramana Kumar and Arun Kurkure and Lizzy Sunny,5,Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention,3,308-315,Asian Pacific Education Press Ltd.,Background: Breast. cervix and ovarian cancers contribute more than 45% of the total in women in Mumbai and survival proportions for these neoplasms are very high in most developed populations in the World. The authors here report and discuss the population-based survival for these cancers in Mumbai. India. Methods: Follow-up information on 4865 cancers of breast. cervix and ovary. registered in the Mumbai Population Based Cancer Registry for the period 1992-1994 was obtained by a variety of methods. including matching with death certificates from the Mumbai vital statistics registration system. postal/telephone enquiries. home visits and scrutiny of medical records. The survival for each case was determined as the duration between the date of diagnosis and date of death. date of loss to follow-up or the closing date of the study (December 31st. 1999). Cumulative observed and relative survival was calculated by the Hakulinen Method. For comparison of results with other populations. age-standardized relative survival (ASRS) was calculated by directly standardizing age specific relative survival to the specific age distributions of the estimated global incidence of major cancers in 1985. The log rank test was used in univariate analysis to identify the potentially important prognostic variables. The variables showing statistical significance in univariate analysis were introduced stepwise into a Cox Regression model to identify the independent predictors of survival.Results: The 5-year relative survival rates were 46.2% for breast. 47.7% for the cervix and 25.4% for the ovary.

Migration patterns have contributed to geographic differences in the frequency of common genetic variants. but population genetic evidence indicates that selection shapes the evolving mtDNA phylogeny. The mechanism and timing of this process are not clear.Unlike the nuclear genome. mtDNA is maternally transmitted and there are many copies in each cell. Initially. a new genetic variant affects only a proportion of the mtDNA (heteroplasmy). During female germ cell development. a reduction in the amount of mtDNA per cell causes a “genetic bottleneck.” which leads to rapid segregation of mtDNA molecules and different levels of heteroplasmy between siblings. Although heteroplasmy is primarily governed by random genetic drift. there is evidence of selection occurring …,True,q9jamNwAAAAJ:pZYLKkizsIQC,76,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6442/eaau6520.abstract,9744662189136332394,/scholar?cites=9744662189136332394,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/293282/AAV%20Germline%20selection%20shapes%20human%20mitochondrial%20DNA%20diversity_forCambridge.pdf?sequence=1,0,0,0

Although BPV-1 E7 by itself is not sufficient to induce cellular transformation. it enhances the abilities of the other BPV-1 oncogenes to induce anchorage independence. We have been exploring the mechanisms by which E7 might affect the transformation efficiency of other viral oncoproteins and in particular whether it might protect cells from apoptosis. We report here that BPV-1 E6 and E7 can each independently inhibit anoikis. a type of apoptosis that is induced upon cell detachment. Using site-directed mutagenesis. we determined regions of the E7 protein that were essential for its antiapoptotic activity.

1099971,Verified uncertainty calibration,2019,Ananya Kumar and Percy Liang and Tengyu Ma,,arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.10155,,,,Applications such as weather forecasting and personalized medicine demand models that output calibrated probability estimates---those representative of the true likelihood of a prediction. Most models are not calibrated out of the box but are recalibrated by post-processing model outputs. We find in this work that popular recalibration methods like Platt scaling and temperature scaling are (i) less calibrated than reported. and (ii) current techniques cannot estimate how miscalibrated they are. An alternative method. histogram binning. has measurable calibration error but is sample inefficient---it requires  samples. compared to  for scaling methods. where  is the number of distinct probabilities the model can output. To get the best of both worlds. we introduce the scaling-binning calibrator. which first fits a parametric function to reduce variance and then bins the function values to actually ensure calibration. This requires only  samples. Next. we show that we can estimate a model's calibration error more accurately using an estimator from the meteorological community---or equivalently measure its calibration error with fewer samples ( instead of ). We validate our approach with multiclass calibration experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. where we obtain a 35% lower calibration error than histogram binning and. unlike scaling methods. guarantees on true calibration. In these experiments. we also estimate the calibration error and ECE more accurately than the commonly used plugin estimators.

Two mechanisms have been identified for ET in DNA. a single-step tunneling process and a multistep charge-hopping process. The dynamics of tunneling reactions depend on both the distance between the electron donor and acceptor and the nature of the molecular bridge separating the donor and acceptor. In the case of protein and alkane bridges. the distance dependence is not strongly dependent on the properties of the donor and acceptor. In contrast. we show here that the distance decay of DNA ET rates varies markedly with the energetics of the donor and acceptor relative to the bridge.

Photodimerization and cross-cycloaddition of coumarin,1989,Frederick D Lewis and Steven V Barancyk,111,Journal of the American Chemical Society,23,8653-8661,American Chemical Society,The effect of Lewis acid complexation upon the electronicstructure and photochemical behavior of coumarin has been investigated. Changes in IR and NMR spectra upon complexation of coumarin with BF3 or EtAlCl2 are indicative of 1: 1 complexation of the Lewis acid with the carbonyl oxygen. Changes in the UV spectrum and the observation of room-temperature fluorescence from the coumarin-BF3 complex are attributed to increased energy of the.* singlet state relative to the fluorescent.* singlet state. Dimerization is found to occur via the reaction of either the singlet or triplet complex with ground-state coumarin. The singlet-state reaction selectively yields the syn head-to-tail dimer while the triplet-state reaction yields the anti head-to-head dimer. The singlet-and triplet-state complexes also react with simple alkenes.

The crystal structure of a SE-bridged hairpin confirms that it adopts a B-form structure in which the stilbene is π-stacked with the adjacent base pair. The stilbenediether also mediates novel lattice interactions that are distinct from those normally found in DNA crystals. The singlet excited state of the stilbenediether is a strong electron donor which is rapidly quenched by either neighboring dT-dA or dC-dG base pairs which function as electron acceptors. This behavior is complementary to that of conjugates possessing a stilbenedicarboxamide linker (SA. Chart 1). which serves as an electron acceptor. 3. 4 The conjugates 1-7 display a long wavelength absorption band (λmax) 327 nm) assigned to the stilbene π. π* transition and a shorter wavelength band (λmax) 260 nm) assigned to overlapping stilbene and nucleobase absorption bands.

Rate constants for both forward and return hole transport between the primary and secondary donor are obtained from kinetic modeling of the nanosecond transient absorption decay profiles of the stilbene anion radical.

The light harvesting antennas of the dendrimer funnel energy to the center BINOL unit. whose hydroxyl groups upon interaction with a quencher molecule lead to fluorescence quenching.

These include the assessment of the ability of a firm to pay its debts. the evaluation of business and managerial success and even the statutory regulation ofa firm's performance. Not surprisingly they become norms and actually affect performance.'The traditional textbooks of financial analysis also emphasise the need for a firm to use industry-wide averages as targets (Fouike. 1968). and there is evidence that firms do adjust their financial ratios to such targets.^ Whittington (1980) identified two principal uses of financial ratios. The traditional. normative use ofthe measurement ofa firm's ratio compared with a standard. and the positive use in estimating empirical relationships. usually for predictive purposes. The former dates back to the late nineteenth century and the increase in US bank credit given as a result of the Civil War when current and non-current items were segregated and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was developed (Horrigan. 1968; and Dev. 1974). From then the use of ratios both for credit purposes and managerial analysis. focusing on profitability measures soon began.

1100017,The prediction of takeover targets in the UK by means of multiple discriminant analysis,1990,Paul Barnes,17,Journal of Business Finance & Accounting,1,73-84,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,The use of accounfing data (either explicitly or implicitly) for predictive purposes is at the heart of financial decision making. Nowhere is it more active than in the area of bankruptcy prediction and the use of statistical models and accounting ratios in an effort to predict company failure for up to four years in advance.'The proponents of such an approach have claimed considerable success. On the other hand there have been many critics claiming that these studies have cast aside methodological considerations and that the predictive ability of the models is widely exaggerated. Usually the statistical technique of multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) has been used in order to estimate a linear model which best discriminates between the two population groups (failed and nonfailed) in terms of their distinguishing financial characteristics (their financial ratios. independent variables in the discriminating model). The discriminating model is then used to predict group membership. ie failure and nonfailure. Probit and logit have more recently become popular for estimating the model.The fixation by researchers with the forecasting of corporate death is alone worthy of research (vicarious deathwish?). but outside the scope of this paper. However. it must be said that there are many far more profitable events than corporate failure worthy of such an approach. none more so than the prediction of takeover.

Burpless). A single 6‐ or 8‐h exposure to UV‐B applied against a background of white light inhibited hypocotyl elongation rate by ca 50% in lh and WT seedlings. This effect was not accompanied by a reduction in cotyledon area expansion or dry matter accumulation. Plants recovered rapidly from inhibition and it was possible to stimulate hypocotyl elongation in plants exposed to UV‐B by application of gibberellic acid.

In analogy to the already described s-PS molecular complexes. this structure presents a monoclinic unit cell (cell constants a = 17.5 Å. b = 14.5 Å. c = 7.8 Å. and γ = 107.8°) in which the s(2/1)2 polymer helices and guest molecules are packed according to the space group P21/a. However. the structure of the s-PS/NB complex presents layers of contiguous guest molecules alternated with layers of enantiomorphous polymer helices and hence can be described as an intercalate phase.

We present direct examples of these critical steps by using scanning tunneling microscopy to study mixtures of complementary organic ligands on a copper substrate. The ligands coordinate cooperatively with iron atoms to form well ordered arrays of rectangular multicomponent compartments whose size and shape can be deliberately tuned by selecting ligands of desired length from complementary ligand families. We demonstrate explicitly that highly ordered supramolecular arrays can be produced from redundant ligand mixtures by molecular self-recognition and -selection. enabled by efficient error correction and cooperativity. and show an example of failed self-selection due to error tolerance in the ligand …,True,-UmmIIkAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,202,https://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17927.short,6710572307939231314,/scholar?cites=6710572307939231314,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/104/46/17927.full.pdf,0,0,0

The hallmark of this transition is a change of the spin of the metal ion. S Fe= 0 to S Fe= 2. at fixed oxidation state of the Fe ion. Combining density functional theory and first principles calculations. we demonstrate that within a single molecule this transition can be triggered by charging the ligands. In this process the total spin of the molecule. combining metal ion and ligands. crosses over from S= 0 to S= 1. Three-terminal transport through a single molecule shows indications of this transition induced by electric gating.

The addition of alkynesto Cp2Zr= NR occurred regioselectively to give metallacycles 2. with the larger alkyne substituent RL located a to the metal center.

In contrast. there are no reports of additions to ketones that are both general and highly enantioselective. We describe herein a practical catalytic asymmetric addition of ethyl groups to ketones. The catalyst is derived from reaction of camphor sulfonyl chloride and trans-1.2-diaminocyclohexane. The resulting diketone is reduced with NaBH4 to give the C2-symmetric exo diastereomer. Use of this ligand with titanium tetraisopropoxide and dialkylzinc at room temperature results in enantioselective addition of the alkyl group to the ketone. The resulting tertiary alcohols are isolated with high enantiomeric excess (all cases give greater than 87% ee. except one).

Nanostructured inorganic. organic. or hybrid organicinorganic nanocomposites present paramount advantages to facilitate integration and miniaturization of the devices (nanotechnologies). thus affording a direct connection between the inorganic. organic. and biological worlds. The ability to assemble and organize inorganic. organic. and even biological components in a single material represents an exciting direction for developing novel multifunctional materials presenting a wide range of novel properties. 1 Soft chemistry based processes (ie. chemistry at low temperatures and pressures. from molecular or colloidal precursors) clearly offer innovative strategies to obtain tailored nanostructured materials. The mild conditions of sol-gel chemistry provide reacting systems mostly under kinetic control. Therefore. slight changes of experimental parameters (ie. pH. concentrations. temperatures. nature of the solvent. counterions) can lead to substantial modifications of the resulting supramolecular assemblies.

Precipitation mechanism,1999,Galo J de AA Soler-Illia and Matías Jobbágy and Alberto E Regazzoni and Miguel A Blesa,11,Chemistry of materials,11,3140-3146,American Chemical Society,Uniform microcrystalline nickel(II) hydroxide particles have been prepared via the homogeneous alkalinization of nickel(II) nitrate solutions by urea hydrolysis. The nature of the precipitated solids depends on the temperature of synthesis. At ca. 423 K. i.e.. under the hydrothermal conditions attained by microwave heating. β-Ni(OH)2 forms upon the fast ripening of α-Ni(OH)2. In the range 363−343 K. α-Ni(OH)2 is always the final product. The evolution of the systems during the precipitation of α-Ni(OH)2 is analyzed in terms of the kinetic factors that control nucleation and growth. A precipitation mechanism. based on the principle of minimal structural change. is proposed; it is suggested that the edge-on condensation of Ni4(OH)44+ tetramers is a key step in the sequence of events that conduct from hexaaquo Ni2+ to α-Ni(OH)2. ,True,cs73BDMAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,154,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm9902220,11253351511804147581,/scholar?cites=11253351511804147581,,http://solgel2009.qi.fcen.uba.ar/pdf/Chem%20Mater%2011(%201999)%203140-3146.pdf,0,0,0

Ltd.,Antioxidant activities of three phenolic alkaloids. i.e.. oleracein A (OA). oleracein B (OB) and oleracein E (OE). isolated from Portulaca oleracea were determined. based on scavenging activity against 1.1‐diphenyl‐ 2‐picryl‐hydrazyl (DPPH) radical and inhibitory effect on hydrogen peroxide‐induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates. The DPPH radical scavenging activities of these phenolic alkaloids were lower than caffeic acid but higher than ascorbic acid and α‐tocopherol. being in the following order: OB > OA > OE. OE was most potent in preventing formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) with an EC50 value of 73.13 µM. close to that of caffeic acid (72.09 µM).

However. the conditions that foster tight binding between the diol and the boronic acid are not well understood. Also. due to the multiple ionic states of both the boronic acid and boronate ester. the equilibrium constants reported in the literature have not always been strictly defined. and therefore there is a lack of ‘comparability’ between the reported values. To address these issues. we have developed a method for examining boronate ester stability using the fluorescent reporter Alizarin Red S.

The geometric constraints of the system have been studied in both intra- and intermolecular model systems of the boron−nitrogen (B−N) bonding interaction. The effect of the B−N bonding on the rate of electron-transfer (ET) quenching of the anthracene acceptor by an amine donor is considered using a theoretical model. The results suggest a new mechanism other than B−N bond strength change for fluorescent switching in biosensors that involve interaction of boron and nitrogen affected by boronate ester formation. ,True,-Ar6wDIAAAAJ:Se3iqnhoufwC,142,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp027457a,18028892378689966656,/scholar?cites=18028892378689966656,,,0,0,0

Template-directed polymerization or molecular imprinting seems to be a promising approach for the preparation of high-affinity and specific binding sites for different template molecules. However. the application of molecular imprinting in the preparation of fluorescent sensors has been hampered by the lack of suitable fluorescent tags. which would respond to the binding event with significant fluorescence intensity changes. We have designed and synthesized a fluorescent monomer (1) that allows for the preparation of fluorescent sensors of cis diols using molecular imprinting methods. This monomer has been used for the preparation of imprinted polymers as sensitive fluorescent sensors for d-fructose.

Such application is based on the significant fluorescence intensity increase of this system upon binding with a carbohydrate. The mechanism through which this fluorescence intensity change happens was originally proposed to go through a B–N bond formation mechanism. which masks the nitrogen lone pair electrons. However. our own fluorescence studies suggest a possible alternative mechanism for the fluorescence change upon the formation of a boronic acid (1a) complex with diols. In this new proposed mechanism. complex formation induces solvolysis. which results in the protonation of the amine nitrogen if the reactions are carried out in a protic solvent such as water. This protonation prevents the photoinduced electron transfer. resulting …,True,-Ar6wDIAAAAJ:0EnyYjriUFMC,117,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045206804000537,15586601401349031220,/scholar?cites=15586601401349031220,,https://www.academia.edu/download/47544885/Regulating_the_fluorescence_intensity_of20160726-20407-qc76t9.pdf,0,0,0

The effective bond activation is thus most often a heteroatom-assisted process. involving classical donors such as N. O. P. S.

In the presence of sulfur dioxide. these complexes spontaneously adsorb this gas to form pentacoordinated adducts. Solid-state crystal-structure analyses of the SO2 adducts 8 c (X=I. R=R=Me. E=OSiMe2tBu) and 11 (X=Cl. R=R=Me. E=OH) show a square-pyramidal geometry around the metal center with SO2 in the apical position. Most interestingly. the adduct 11 forms similar Pt-ClH-O hydrogen-bonded -type networks as the corresponding SO2-free complex 5. The conservation of the supramolecular information (hydrogen-bonded self-assembly) throughout a reaction (SO2 adsorption) is unprecedented in crystal engineering. Adduct formation in the solid state or in solution is fast and reversible and is indicated by a characteristic color change of the material from colorless to bright orange. Since facile methods have been developed to remove SO2 from the adducts and to regenerate the square-planar starting complexes. these complexes fulfill several essential prerequisites of sensor materials for repeated diagnostic SO2 detection. The platinum sensors have been found to be highly selective for sulfur dioxide and particularly sensitive for submilimolar to molar gas quantities.

At 26 weeks of age. plaque area in the catK−/−/apoE−/− mice was reduced (41.8%) owing to a decrease in the number of advanced lesions as well as a decrease in individual advanced plaque area. This suggests an important role for catK in atherosclerosis progression. Advanced plaques of catK−/−/apoE−/− mice showed an increase in collagen content.

The development of less toxic. liposomal formulations of cisplatin has been hampered by the low water solubility and low lipophilicity of cisplatin. resulting in very low encapsulation efficiencies. We describe a novel method allowing the efficient encapsulation of cisplatin in a lipid formulation; it is based on repeated freezing and thawing of a concentrated solution of cisplatin in the presence of negatively charged phospholipids. The method is unique in that it generates nanocapsules. which are small aggregates of cisplatin covered by a single lipid bilayer. The nanocapsules have an unprecedented drug-to-lipid ratio and an in vitro cytotoxicity up to 1000-fold higher than the free drug.

The levels of these metals in soil and vegetation are much higher than typical background concentrations. Integration of the concentration vs. distance curves along transects perpendicular to the roads yields areas proportional to the heavy metal burden of the roadside soil and vegetation. These areas exhibit a significant correlation with the vehicular traffic density and it is shown that they represent more accurately the severity of pollution than the maximum levels at the same locality. It was found that wind direction affects the distribution of Pb along a transect.

Ltd.,This paper is concerned with the application of our selected ion flow tube mass spectrometric analytical method (SIFT‐MS) to the analysis of the complex aromas of some food products. This SIFT/MS chemical ionisation technique. to date mostly applied to breath analysis in medicine and health and safety practice. involves the use of pre‐selected H3O+. NO+ and O2 + ions to ‘soft ionise’ the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that constitute complex mixtures such as food aromas. The kinetics involved are well‐defined thus allowing quantification of several trace gases simultaneously in an air sample in real time without the need for pre‐calibration. In order to facilitate the interpretation of the spectra obtained for complex mixtures by SIFT/MS we have carried out detailed studies of the reactions of these three ion species with a wide variety of organic compounds including many alcohols. aldehydes. ketone. esters …,True,BqzItCcAAAAJ:SeFeTyx0c_EC,140,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(19990415)13:7%3C585::AID-RCM527%3E3.0.CO;2-K,14278440329097243580,/scholar?cites=14278440329097243580,,,0,0,0

A simple but robust approach based on the matrix sign function is employed together with a thresholding matrix multiplication that does not require a prescribed sparsity pattern. Semiempirical methods and density functional theory have been tested. We demonstrate that self-consistent calculations with 1 million atoms are feasible for simple systems. With this approach. the computational cost of the calculation depends strongly on basis set quality. In the current implementation. high quality calculations for dense systems are limited to a few hundred thousand atoms. We report on the sparsities of the involved matrices as obtained at convergence and for intermediate iterations.

The potential energy surface in the excited state is described either within the restricted open‐shell Kohn–Sham (ROKS) formalism or within time‐dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). As a test case. we apply this technique to the study of the solvent effects on the ground state and on the first excited singlet state of acetone in water. Our results demonstrate that for this system a purely classical description of the solvent is sufficient. since inclusion of the first solvent shell of 12 water molecules into the quantum system does not show a significant effect on this transition.

During the last twenty years. many studies have been performed to characterize the chemicals isolable from these animals. In this paper we summarize the studies covering two large groups of opistobranch molluscs: sacoglossans and dorids. The main aim is to give to the readers a brief view of the compounds isolated from these molluscs. and. when it is possible. to suggest an ecological role for them. The Order Sacoglossa has been selected as it contains a wide range of morphological types from primitive species with a relatively strong external shell to shell-less types. The chemical studies of these molluscs have been reviewed with the aim of constructing a general scenario based on chemical evidence. Similar reasons prompted us to review the chemical data of the shell-less dorid nudibranchs belonging to the super-families Eudoridoidea and Bathydoridoidea. In this case. the review dates from the literature subsequent to Karuso's 1987 review"" Chemical Ecology of Nudibranchs"".

Here we describe the origin of PUSCAs produced by the marine diatom Skeletonema costatum via a lipoxygenase-mediated pathways involving non-esterified polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).

We show that copepod dysfunctions can be induced by highly reactive oxygen species (hROS) and a blended mixture of diatom products. including fatty acid hydroperoxides (FAHs); these compounds display teratogenic and proapoptotic properties. The process is triggered by the early onset of lipoxygenase activities that elicit the synthesis of species‐specific products. the basic structures of which were established (1–20); these compounds boost oxidative stress by massive lipid peroxidation.

The data are consistent with a description in terms of a mobile neutral magnetic defect in the trans polymer and a stationary one in the cis‐rich polymer. The spin resonance linewidths are determined by unresolved hyperfine splittings resulting from interaction of the electron spin with many nuclear spins within the envelope of the spatially extended magnetic defect.

Free hydrogen does not occur naturally in quantity. and it should be generated from some other energy source by steam reformation of natural gas or other methods.

Coordination networks are a subset of coordination polymers and MOFs a further subset of coordination networks. One of the criteria an MOF needs to fulfill is that it contains poten- tial voids. but no physical measurements of porosity or other properties are demanded per se. The use of topology and topology descriptors to enhance the description of crystal structures of MOFs and 3D-coordination polymers is furthermore strongly recommended.,True,Y3wkTBYAAAAJ:UxriW0iASnsC,787,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/181419/local_181419.pdf,17661258560278844301,/scholar?cites=17661258560278844301,,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/181419/local_181419.pdf,0,0,0

The assignment approach takes advantage of the spectral dispersion of the amide nitrogen chemical shifts in denatured proteins by correlating side chain and backbone carbon and proton frequencies with the amide resonances of the same and adiacent residues. The 1H resonances of the individual amino acid spin systems are correlated with their intraresidue amide in a 3D 15N-edited 1H. 1H-TOCSY-HSQC experiment. which allows the spin systems to be assigned to amino acid type.

However. a general analysis of its ability to discriminate species in a comprehensive sample set is lacking.  Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study. 50.790 plant and 12.221 animal ITS2 sequences downloaded from GenBank were evaluated according to sequence length. GC content. intra- and inter-specific divergence. and efficiency of identification. The results show that the inter-specific divergence of congeneric species in plants and animals was greater than its corresponding intra-specific variations. The success rates for using the ITS2 region to identify dicotyledons. monocotyledons. gymnosperms. ferns. mosses. and animals were 76.1%. 74.2%. 67.1%. 88.1%. 77.4%. and 91.7% at the species level. respectively.

However. the role of these factors is not well understood. Hence. the aim of this study was to systematically investigate the role of surface charge. oxidative stress and possible involvement of mitochondria in the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon exposure of rat macrophage NR8383 cells to silicon nanoparticles. For this aim highly monodisperse (size 1.6 ± 0.2 nm) and well-characterized Si core nanoparticles (Si NP) were used with a surface charge that depends on the specific covalently bound organic monolayers: positively charged Si NP-NH2. neutral Si NP-N3 and negatively charged Si NP-COOH. Positively charged Si NP-NH2 proved to be more cytotoxic in terms of reducing mitochondrial metabolic activity and effects on phagocytosis than neutral Si NP-N3. while negatively charged Si NP-COOH showed very little or no cytotoxicity. Si NP-NH2 produced the highest level of intracellular ROS. followed by Si NP-N3 and Si NP-COOH; the latter did not induce any intracellular ROS production. A similar trend in ROS production was observed in incubations with an isolated mitochondrial fraction from rat liver tissue in the presence of Si NP.

Nevertheless. this important connection remained elusive for decades and no theoretical regularities in the rates and product type distribution have been found. Here we contend that any nanotube can be viewed as having a screw dislocation along the axis. Consequently. its growth rate is shown to be proportional to the Burgers vector of such dislocation and therefore to the chiral angle of the tube.

To help chemists select photocatalytic methods for their synthesis. we compare in this Review classical and photocatalytic procedures for selected classes of reactions and highlight their advantages and limitations. In many cases. the photocatalytic reactions proceed under milder reaction conditions. typically at room temperature. and stoichiometric reagents are replaced by simple oxidants or reductants. such as air. oxygen. or amines.

1100653,Synthesis and applications of β-aminocarboxylic acids containing a cyclopropane ring,2003,Frieder Gnad and Oliver Reiser,103,,4,1603-1624,American Chemical Society,The overwhelming importance of R-amino acids in biologically relevant processes has also been manifested for many cyclopropane-containing derivatives. 1 With the growing realization that some β-amino acids also display significant biological activities2 and because the latter are valuable constituents in peptides. 3 cyclopropyl-substituted analogues have attracted widespread attention in recent years. In addition. cyclopropyl-modified β-alanines have been proved to be useful intermediates in organic syntheses. making use of the amino. the carboxyl. and the cyclopropyl group as reactive functionalities. There are three different possibilities how β-alanine (1) can be fused directly with a cyclopropane ring: the cyclopropyl group can be placed like two geminal substituents in the R-or β-position of 1 as depicted in 2 or 3. respectively. or incorporating the R-and β-position as shown in 4.
