118009,Insulin receptor isoforms and insulin receptor/insulin-like growth factor receptor hybrids in physiology and disease,2009,Antonino Belfiore and Francesco Frasca and Giuseppe Pandini and Laura Sciacca and Riccardo Vigneri,30,,6,586-623,Oxford University Press,In mammals. the insulin receptor (IR) gene has acquired an additional exon. exon 11. This exon may be skipped in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. The IR. therefore. occurs in two isoforms (exon 11 minus IR-A and exon 11 plus IR-B). The most relevant functional difference between these two isoforms is the high affinity of IR-A for IGF-II.IR-A is predominantly expressed during prenatal life. It enhances the effects of IGF-II during embryogenesis and fetal development. It is also significantly expressed in adult tissues. especially in the brain. Conversely. IR-B is predominantly expressed in adult. well-differentiated tissues. including the liver. where it enhances the metabolic effects of insulin.Dysregulation of IR splicing in insulin target tissues may occur in patients with insulin resistance; however. its role in type 2 diabetes is unclear.IR-A is often aberrantly expressed in cancer cells. thus …,True,7ooWEqkAAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC,961,https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article-abstract/30/6/586/2355072,18155613270017340140,/scholar?cites=18155613270017340140,,https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/30/6/586/2355072,0,0,0

IGF-II is believed to mediate its cellular signaling via the transmembrane tyrosine kinase type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-I-R). which is also the receptor for IGF-I. Earlier studies with both cultured cells and transgenic mice. however. have suggested that in the embryo the insulin receptor (IR) may also be a receptor for IGF-II. In most cells and tissues. IR binds IGF-II with relatively low affinity. The IR is expressed in two isoforms (IR-A and IR-B) differing by 12 amino acids due to the alternative splicing of exon 11. In the present study we found that IR-A but not IR-B bound IGF-II with an affinity close to that of insulin. Moreover.

Clinically. these disorders usually affect a single organ or gland in the body. but serological evidence (ie autoantibodies) often indicates subclinical disturbances in other related tissues. The target antigens of the immunological response are unique to the affected organ. thus giving rise to the organ-specific and even cell-specific recognition. The precedent for autoimmune disease was set in 1956 with the demonstration that autoimmunity is the basis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Roitt et al. 1956).

Univariate analysis indicated that BRAF (V600E) was associated with greater tumor size (PZ0. 0048). extra-thyroid invasion (P! 0.0001). and cervical lymph nodal metastases (PZ0. 0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that BRAF (V600E) was an independent predictor of extra-thyroid invasion (PZ0. 0001) and cervical lymph nodal metastasis (PZ0. 0005). The association between BRAF (V600E) and extra-thyroid invasion was also found in micro-PTCs (PZ0. 006). In 60 classical PTCs. BRAF (V600E) was positively correlated with matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression (PZ0. 0047). suggesting a possible mechanism for BRAF (V600E) effect on PTC invasiveness. No association was found between BRAF (V600E) and patient age. gender. or iodine intake.

Therefore. a variety of strategies have been developed to block the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). which is thought to mediate the biological effects of both IGF-I and IGF-II. However. recent data suggest that the IGF signalling system is complex and that other receptors are involved. To unravel the complexity of the IGF system in thyroid cancer. IGF-I and IGF-II production. and the expression and function of their cognate receptors were studied. Both IGFs were found to be locally produced in thyroid cancer: IGF-I by stromal cells and IGF-II by malignant thyrocytes. Values were significantly higher in malignant tissue than in normal tissue.

It is well recognized that the epithelial breast cancer cells commonly overexpress the IGF-I receptor while IGF-II is expressed by the tumor stroma. In view to the fact that the IGF-IR has mitogenic. pro-invasive and anti-apoptotic effects and mediates resistance to a variety of anti-cancer therapies. breast cancer is expected to be a candidate to therapeutic approaches aimed to inhibit the IGF-IR. However. there is increasing awareness that IGF system in cancer undergoes signal diversification by various mechanisms.

118046,The emerging role of insulin and insulin-like growth factor signaling in cancer stem cells,2014,Roberta Malaguarnera and Antonino Belfiore,5,,,10,Frontiers,Cancer cells frequently exploit the IGF signaling. a fundamental pathway mediating development. cell growth and survival. As a consequence. several components of the IGF signaling are deregulated in cancer and sustain cancer progression. However. specific targeting of IGF-IR in humans has resulted efficacious only in small subsets of cancers. making researches wondering whether IGF system targeting is still worth pursuing in the clinical setting. Although no definite answer is yet available. it has become increasingly clear that other components of the IGF signaling pathway. such as IR-A. may substitute for the lack of IGF-IR. and induce cancer resistance and/or clonal selection. Moreover. accumulating evidence now indicates that IGF signaling is a central player in the induction/maintenance of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell stemness. two strictly related programs. which play a key role in metastatic spread and resistance to cancer treatments. Here we review the evidences indicating that IGF signaling enhances the expression of transcription factors implicated in the EMT program and has extensive crosstalk with specific pathways involved in cell pluripotency and stemness maintenance. In turn. EMT and cell stemness activate positive feed-back mechanisms causing upregulation of various IGF signaling components.

Several lines of evidence have indicated a pathogenic role of insulin resistance. and a strong association with type 2 diabetes (T2MD) and metabolic syndrome. Importantly. NAFLD appears to enhance the risk for T2MD. as well as worsen glycemic control and cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients. In turn. T2MD may promote NAFLD progression. The opportunity to take into account NAFLD in T2MD prevention and care has stimulated several clinical studies in which antidiabetic drugs. such as metformin. thiazolidinediones. GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibitors have been evaluated in NAFLD patients. In this review. we provide an overview of preclinical and clinical evidences on the possible efficacy of antidiabetic drugs in NAFLD treatment. Overall. available data suggest that metformin has beneficial effects on body weight reduction and metabolic parameters. with uncertain effects on liver histology. while pioglitazone may improve liver histology. Few data. mostly preclinical. are available on DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues. The heterogeneity of these studies and the small number of patients do not allow for firm conclusions about treatment guidelines. and further randomized. controlled studies are needed.

118053,PPAR-agonists and their effects on IGF-I receptor signaling: implications for cancer,2009,A Belfiore and M Genua and R Malaguarnera,2009,,,,Hindawi,It is now well established that the development and progression of a variety of human malignancies are associated with dysregulated activity of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system. In this regard. promising drugs have been developed to target the IGF-I receptor or its ligands. These therapies are limited by the development of insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. which in turn. may stimulate cancer growth. Novel therapeutic approaches are. therefore. required. Synthetic PPAR-                 agonists. such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs). are drugs universally used as antidiabetic agents in patients with type 2 diabetes.  In addition of acting as insulin sensitizers. PPAR-                 agonists mediate in vitro and in vivo pleiotropic anticancer effects.  At least some of these effects appear to be linked with the downregulation of the IGF system. which is induced by the cross-talk of PPAR-                 agonists with multiple components of the IGF system signaling. As hyperinsulinemia is an emerging cancer risk factor. the insulin lowering action of PPAR-                 agonists may be expected to be also beneficial to reduce cancer development and/or progression.  In light of these evidences.

In this paper. the discriminating variables and the algorithms used for heavy-flavour jet identification during the first years of operation of the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. are presented. Heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms have been improved compared to those used previously at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. For jets with transverse momenta in the range expected in simulated  events. these new developments result in an efficiency of 68% for the correct identification of ab jet for a probability of 1% of misidentifying a light-flavour jet. The improvement in relative efficiency at this misidentification probability is about 15%. compared to previous CMS algorithms. In addition. for the first time algorithms have been developed to identify jets containing two b hadrons in Lorentz-boosted event topologies. as well as to tag c jets. The large data sample recorded in 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has also allowed the development of new methods to measure the efficiency and misidentification probability of heavy-flavour jet identification algorithms. The heavy-flavour jet identification efficiency is measured with a precision of a few per cent at moderate jet transverse momenta (between 30 and 300 GeV) and about 5% at the highest jet transverse momenta (between 500 and 1000 GeV).,True,cGiFQZ4AAAAJ:QsKbpXNoaWkC,906,https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07158,18233919819845043249,/scholar?cites=18233919819845043249,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07158,0,0,0

118064,EBK-means: A clustering technique based on elbow method and k-means in WSN,2014,Purnima Bholowalia and Arvind Kumar,105,International Journal of Computer Applications,9,,Foundation of Computer Science,WSN consist of hundreds of thousands of small and cost effective sensor nodes. Sensor nodes are used to sense the environmental or physiological parameters like temperature. pressure. etc. For the connectivity of the sensor nodes. they use wireless transceiver to send and receive the inter-node signals. Sensor nodes. because connect their selves wirelessly. use routing process to route the packet to make them reach from source to destination. These sensor nodes run on batteries and they carry a limited battery life. Clustering is the process of creating virtual sub-groups of the sensor nodes. which helps the sensor nodes to lower routing computations and to lower the size routing data. There is a wide space available for the research on energy efficient clustering algorithms for the WSNs. LEACH. PEGASIS and HEED are the popular energy efficient clustering protocols for WSNs. In this research. we are working on the development of a hybrid model using LEACH based energy efficient and K-means based quick clustering algorithms to produce a new cluster scheme for WSNs with dynamic selection of the number of the clusters automatically. In the proposed method. finding an optimum „k‟ value is performed by Elbow method and clustering is done by k-means algorithm. hence routing protocol LEACH which is a traditional energy efficient protocol takes the work ahead of sending data from the cluster heads to the base station. The results of simulation show that at the end of some certain part of running the proposed algorithm. at some point the marginal gain will drop dramatically and gives an angle in the graph.

The rate of photosynthesis declines at moderately high temperatures in plants and particularly in temperate species like Arabidopsis thaliana. This can be attributed to a reduced ability of Rubisco activase to achieve optimum activation of Rubisco. leading to reduced Rubisco activity. In order to overcome this problem. we transformed the Arabidopsis rca mutant with a more thermostable. chimeric activase where a Rubisco recognition domain in the more thermostable tobacco activase was replaced with that from Arabidopsis. Transgenic lines expressing this activase showed higher rates of photosynthesis than the wild type after a short exposure to higher temperatures and they also recovered better. when they were returned to the normal temperature.

The model liquid has constant properties except viscosity (temperature dependent and shear thinning) and density (Boussinesq approximation). The velocity field establishes itself much more rapidly than the temperature field. The maximum axial velocity is of the order of 10−4m s−1 because of low Grashof number. The coldest point is not fixed but migrates in a region that is 10–12% of the can height from the bottom of the can and at a radial distance approximately one-half of the radius.

These kinases exhibit a high degree of hornology to NPK1. a tobacco protein that is a member of the family of mitogen‐activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs). which appears to function in the proliferation of tobacco cells. The predicted amino acid sequences of the kinase domains in the amino‐terminal halves of the ANPs were more than 80% identical to that of NPK1. while the kinase‐unrelated regions in the carboxy‐terminal halves exhibited relatively low homology. Two species of cANP1 were identified. ANP1L cDNA (cANPIL) and ANP1S cDNA (cANP1S). which were derived from a single ANP1 gene: the former had an intron‐like sequence in the coding region for the kinase‐unrelated region. while the latter did not include such an intron …,True,iMxT5joAAAAJ:4JMBOYKVnBMC,102,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1997.12010039.x,9731730208189534198,/scholar?cites=9731730208189534198,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-313X.1997.12010039.x,0,0,0

Such an outcome suggests that this substitution in other MEKs would exhibit similar properties. The Ste7p-P368 variant has higher basal enzymatic activity than Ste7p but still requires induction to reach full activation.

Bone growth is achieved in the young by a process called modeling. and maintained during adulthood by a process termed remodeling. Three types of cells are responsible for the formation of cartilage and bone; the chondrocyte. osteoblast. and osteoclast. These cells are under the influence of a plethora of regulatory molecules. which govern their action to provide an individual optimal bone mass. Interruption of this homeostatic machinery. especially in the elderly. often results in a loss of bone mass (osteoporosis) or cartilage damage (rheumatoid arthritis).

118191,Fatty acid composition and energy density of foods available to African hominids',2001,Loren Cordain and Bruce A Watkins and Neil J Mann,,,,,,With the emergence of species of our own genus (Homo habilis) at least 2.3 million years ago [1]. a rapid increase in hominid brain mass relative to body mass (encephalization) occurred [2. 3]. Figure 1 shows that the range of cranial capacities for Homo habilis significantly exceeded that of earlier Australopithecus species. whose brain volumes remained constant for at least 2 million years. Slightly prior to the emergence of Homo habilis in the fossil record was the appearance of primitive stone tools [4] whose function was to butcher and disarticulate either scavenged or hunted carcasses of African prey animals [5. 6]. The advent of stone tools as well as the appearance of stone-tool cut marks on the fossilized bones of prey animals suggests that early members of our genus were increasingly exploiting animal foods as a source of sustenance. This dietary shift from a predominantly plant based diet to one in which animal foods became increasingly important allowed for the relaxation of the selection pressures that had formerly constrained encephalization in Australopithecus species [7. 8]. In modern humans the brain utilizes 20–25% of the total resting metabolic rate (RMR) whereas in other primates. this value is 8–9%[9]. Because the brain is more metabolically active at rest than the average body RMR. a relative increase in the encephalization index. such as that which occurred in early members of Homo. requires that either the total metabolic rate increases on a per weight basis.,True,vzQKbwIAAAAJ:LkGwnXOMwfcC,134,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=pHINwjeuF9gC&oi=fnd&pg=PA144&dq=info:kuvCgSROe8gJ:scholar.google.com&ots=_uL6Lg5Cfi&sig=1JsBxMlxOZcOFQ8U399ukAOeQkQ,14446226148423822226,/scholar?cites=14446226148423822226,,https://www.mastercardusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Fatty-Acid-Composition-and-Energy-Density-of-African-Hominids-Foods-The-Paleo-Diet.pdf,0,0,0

118194,Importance of essential fatty acids and their derivatives in poultry,1991,Bruce A Watkins,121,,9,1475-1485,Oxford University Press,More than thirty-five years have passed since essential fatty acid requirements were demonstrated for poultry. Subsequent studies were conducted to establish a recommended level of linoleic acid for growing poultry. Although a requirement of 1% linoleic acid is suggested. a critical evaluation of the nutritional and metabolic significance of essential fatty acids is lacking. Perhaps α-linolenic acid is also essential. but direct evidence is not yet available. Recent literature indicates that several individual fatty acids. including the polyunsaturates derived from essential fatty acids. are biologically active. Furthermore. the numerous elcosanoids biosynthesized from specific polyunsaturates act as either cellular autocrine or paracrine signaling agents.

The classic MBP isoforms are predominantly expressed in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS. The splice variants of the single MBP gene (Golli-MBP BG21 and J37) are widely expressed in the neurons and also in the immune cells. The relative contribution of the individual MMPs to the MBP cleavage is not known.  Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate which MMP plays the primary role in cleaving MBP. we determined the efficiency of MMP-2. MMP-8. MMP-9. MMP-10. MMP-12. MT1-MMP. MT2-MMP. MT3-MMP. MT4-MMP. MT5-MMP and MT6-MMP in the cleavage of the MBP. BG21 and J37 isoforms in the in vitro cleavage reactions followed by mass-spectroscopy analysis of the cleavage fragments. As a result. we identified the MMP cleavage sites and the sequence of the resulting fragments. We determined that MBP. BG21 and J37 are highly sensitive to redundant MMP proteolysis. MT6-MMP (initially called leukolysin). however. was superior over all of the other MMPs in cleaving the MBP isoforms. Using the mixed lymphocyte culture assay. we demonstrated that MT6-MMP proteolysis of the MBP isoforms readily generated. with a near quantitative yield. the immunogenic N-terminal 1–15 MBP peptide.

Earlier. we determined that the estrogen-ER complex stimulates the transcriptional activity of the matrix metalloproteinase 26 (MMP-26) gene promoter. We then determined that ERβ is susceptible to MMP-26 proteolysis whereas ERα is resistant to the protease. MMP-26 targets the NH2-terminal region of ERβ coding for the divergent NH2-terminal A/B domain that is responsible for the ligand-independent transactivation function. As a result. MMP-26 proteolysis generates the COOH-terminal fragments of ERβ.

Because of the works by us and others. matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) has recently emerged as an essential component of the Schwann cell signaling network during sciatic nerve regeneration.   Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study. using the genome-wide transcriptional profiling of normal and injured sciatic nerves in mice followed by extensive bioinformatics analyses of the data. we determined that an endogenous. specific MMP-9 inhibitor [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1] was a top up-regulated gene in the injured nerve. MMP-9 capture followed by gelatin zymography and Western blotting of the isolated samples revealed the presence of the MMP-9/TIMP-1 heterodimers and the activated MMP-9 enzyme in the injured nerve within the first 24 h post-injury. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 co-localized in mSCs. Knockout of the MMP-9 gene in mice resulted in elevated numbers of de-differentiated/immature mSCs in the damaged nerve. Our comparative studies using MMP-9 knockout and wild-type mice documented an aberrantly enhanced proliferative activity and. accordingly. an increased number of post-mitotic Schwann cells. short internodes and additional nodal abnormalities in remyelinated nerves of MMP-9 knockout mice. These data imply that during the first days post-injury MMP-9 exhibits a functionally important anti-mitogenic activity in the wild-type mice.

The plastid originated via a putative single. ancient primary endosymbiosis in which a heterotrophic protist engulfed and retained a cyanobacterium in its cytoplasm. Once successfully established. this plastid spread into other protist lineages through eukaryote-eukaryote (secondary and tertiary) endosymbioses. This process of serial cell capture and enslavement explains the diversity of photosynthetic eukaryotes.

A modelling analysis,2014,Yu Wang and Andrea Bräutigam and Andreas PM Weber and Xin-Guang Zhu,65,Journal of experimental botany,13,3567-3578,Oxford University Press,C4 photosynthesis has higher light-use. nitrogen-use. and water-use efficiencies than C3 photosynthesis. Historically. most of C4 plants were classified into three subtypes (NADP-malic enzyme (ME). NAD-ME. or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) subtypes) according to their major decarboxylation enzyme. However. a wealth of historic and recent data indicates that flexibility exists between different decarboxylation pathways in many C4 species. and this flexibility might be controlled by developmental and environmental cues. This work used systems modelling to theoretically explore the significance of flexibility in decarboxylation mechanisms and transfer acids utilization.

The precursor for ammonia assimilation. 2‐oxoglutarate. is synthesized in the mitochondria and in the cytosol. It is imported into the plastid by a 2‐oxoglutarate/malate translocator (DiT1). In turn. the product of ammonia assimilation. glutamate. is exported from the plastids by a glutamate/malate translocator (DiT2).

It is likely that mitochondrial glutamine synthetase assimilates ammonia. which is generated in large amounts in mitochondria during photorespiration. However. ammonia assimilation is a two-step process and the second step. catalyzed by glutamate synthase. is exclusively located in plastids. Hence. a shuttle for ammonia. possibly in the form of amino acids. is required between mitochondria and plastids. We discuss two alternative shuttles. an ornithine–citrulline shuttle and a glutamine–glutamate shuttle. Both shuttles allow the safe transport of the toxic metabolite ammonium in the form of amino acids.

Anatomical. physiological. and phylogenetic and analyses as well as computational modeling indicate that the establishment of a photorespiratory carbon pump (termed C2 photosynthesis) is a prerequisite for the evolution of C4. However. a mechanistic model explaining the tight connection between the evolution of C4 and C2 photosynthesis is currently lacking. Here we address this question through comparative transcriptomic and biochemical analyses of closely related C3. C3–C4. and C4 species. combined with Flux Balance Analysis constrained through a mechanistic model of carbon fixation. We show that C2 photosynthesis creates a misbalance in nitrogen metabolism between bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Rebalancing nitrogen metabolism requires anaplerotic reactions that resemble at least parts of a basic C4 cycle. Our findings thus show how C2 photosynthesis represents a pre-adaptation for the C4 system. where the evolution of the C2 system establishes important C4 components as a side effect.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02478.001,True,fGsO4gYAAAAJ:M7yex6snE4oC,121,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02478,15907602810790621172,/scholar?cites=15907602810790621172,,https://elifesciences.org/articles/02478.pdf,0,0,0

Bacteria and archaea often adapt through horizontal gene transfer. Recent analyses indicate that eukaryotic genomes. too. have acquired numerous genes via horizontal transfer from prokaryotes and other lineages. Based on this we raise the hypothesis that horizontally acquired genes may have contributed more to adaptive evolution of eukaryotes than previously assumed.

Plastid establishment necessitated many steps. including the transfer and activation of endosymbiont genes that were relocated to the nuclear genome of the 'host' followed by import of the encoded proteins into the organelle. These innovations are. however. highly complex and could not have driven the initial formation of the endosymbiosis. We postulate that the re-targeting of existing host solute transporters to the plastid fore-runner was critical for the early success of the primary endosymbiosis. allowing the host to harvest endosymbiont primary production.

This review focuses on a group of them. namely isothiocyanate. curcumin. genistein. epigallocatechin gallate. lycopene and resveratrol. largely studied as chemopreventive agents and with potential clinical applications. Cellular and animal studies suggest that these molecules induce apoptosis and arrest cell growth by pleiotropic mechanisms. The anticancer efficacy of these compounds may result from their use in monotherapy or in association with chemotherapeutic drugs. This latter approach may represent a new pharmacological strategy against several types of cancers.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play a major role in the appearance of deleterious DNA decays. and this study focuses on the repair of damage linked to decay caused by the action of ROS. The oocyte needs a mechanism for repairing DNA decays in the early preimplantation embryo before the onset of genomic activation. since in the absence of repair. residual DNA damage would lead to either apoptosis or tolerance. Tolerance of DNA damage is a source of potential mutations.GV oocytes were selected for this study. both for the ethical reason that they are unsuitable for patient treatment. and because no transcription takes place during the period from GV to MII and then prior to genomic …,True,alCh_50AAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,129,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-007-9167-0,15834430179615778317,/scholar?cites=15834430179615778317,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3455023/,0,0,0

We recently demonstrated that the flavonoid quercetin. naturally present in the diet and belonging to the class of phytochemicals. is able to sensitize several leukemia cell lines and B cells isolated from patients affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B‐CLL). in addition to apoptotic inducers (anti‐CD95 and rTRAIL). Further. it potentiates the effect of fludarabine. a first‐line chemotherapeutic drug used against CLL. The proapoptotic activity of quercetin in cell lines and B‐CLL is related to the expression and activity of Mcl‐1–antiapoptotic proteins belonging to the Bcl‐2 family.

This review focused on current knowledge about anthocyanins’ role in obesity and its related comorbidities reported in animal models and humans. We summarized their target identification and mechanism of action through several pathways and their final effects on health and well-being. Into consideration of ongoing researches. we highlighted the following key points: a healthy relationship between anthocyanin supplementation and antiobesity effects suffers of the same pros and cons evidenced when the beneficial responses to other phytochemical treatments towards different degenerative diseases have been considered; the different dosage applied in animal versus clinical studies; the complex metabolism and biotransformation to which anthocyanins and phytochemicals are subjected in the intestine and tissues; the possibility that different components present in the supplemented mixtures can interact generating antagonistic. synergistic. or additive effects difficult to predict. and the difference between prevention and therapy.

The phosphorylase is a housekeeping enzyme involved in the purine and amino acid metabolism whose activity is evidentiable in all the normal tissues. Chromosomal deletions encompassing both MTAPase and p16INK4 genes cause the total absence of the enzymatic activity only in malignant cells. thus resulting in defined metabolic differences between malignant and normal cells. MTAPase deficiency was investigated by direct radiochemical assay method and by immunochemical techniques in 35 different human malignant cell lines established from several tumor types. The enzyme-deficient cells derived from breast. lung. ovary and liver cancer. malignant melanomas. malignant gliomas and liposarcomas. Two of the MTAPase-deficient cell preparations (from a liver carcinoma and from a melanoma) are primary cultures thus directly representing the original cancer genotypes. Several of the MTAPase-negative cells were studied for p16INK4 gene deletions and for p16INK4 protein deficiency. In all the examined samples a full correlation exists between the lack of MTAPase and that of p16INK4.

A large and diverse set of peptides can be presented in a polyvalent format. Peptides that are selected from this polyvalent format bind their target in the high micromolar range. Higher affinity peptides are generated from these leads by introducing additional mutations and transferring the pepitides onto a lower valency format to allow the selection of peptides with affinities in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. Such peptides are useful reagents: they may serve as simple probes to understand molecular recognition. they may act as minimized surrogates for known or orphaned receptors. or they may even serve as lead molecules in drug design.

A high-resolution mutational and structural analyses of purified components have revealed a great deal about the molecular basis for GH action. The structural and functional aspects of the interactions between hGH and its receptors have been largely elaborated. From these studies. it has been possible to engineer homologs of hGH to bind to the hGH receptor and act as potential antagonists. Receptor-selective and high-affinity analogs have also been constructed based on a combination of alanine scanning and monovalent phage display. From this molecular work. much has been revealed about the biology of hGH. Available data suggests that hGH is stored in the pituitary as a (Zn2+.hGH)2 complex.

118463,Introduction to phage biology and phage display,2004,Marjorie Russel and Henry B Lowman and Tim Clackson,,Phage Display: A practical approach,,1-26,Oxford University Press: New York. NY. USA,Display of peptides and proteins on filamentous phage—phage display—is an in vitro selection technique that enables polypeptides with desired properties to be extracted from a large collection of variants. A gene of interest is fused to that of a phage coat protein. resulting in phage particles that display the encoded protein and contain its gene. providing a direct link between phenotype and genotype. This allows phage libraries to be subjected to a selection step (eg affinity chromatography). and recovered clones to be identified by sequencing and re-grown for further rounds of selection. Since the initial description of the approach by Smith (1). it has become established as a powerful method for identifying polypeptides with novel properties. and altering the properties of existing ones (for reviews. see 2–5).Filamentous phages are ideal in many ways for use as cloning vehicles and for display in particular. The genome is small and tolerates insertions into nonessential regions; cloning and library construction are facilitated by the ability to isolate both single-and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA). and by the availability of simple plasmid-based vectors; coat proteins can be modified with retention of infectivity; phage can accumulate to high titers since their production does not kill cells; and phage particles are stable to a broad range of potential selection conditions.,True,dN6oziUAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,89,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10647181092875231159&hl=en&oi=scholarr,10647181092875231159,/scholar?cites=10647181092875231159,,https://www.logobook.ru/af/11051225/2361/019963873X_sample.pdf,0,0,0

This study identifies curcumin as a neuroprotectant against hemin-induced damage in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) of rats. Hemin. the oxidized form of heme. is a highly reactive compound that induces cellular injury. Pretreatment of CGNs with 5–30 μM curcumin effectively increased by 2.3–4.9 fold heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression and by 5.6–14.3-fold glutathione (GSH) levels. Moreover. 15 μM curcumin attenuated by 55% the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. by 94% the reduction of GSH/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratio. and by 49% the cell death induced by hemin. The inhibition of heme oxygenase system or GSH synthesis with tin mesoporphyrin and buthionine sulfoximine. respectively. suppressed the protective effect of curcumin against hemin-induced toxicity. These data strongly suggest that HO-1 and GSH play a major role in the protective effect of curcumin.

Bioactive components present in food can simultaneously modulate more than one carcinogenic process. including cancer metabolism. hormonal balance. transcriptional activity. cell-cycle control. apoptosis. inflammation. angiogenesis and metastasis. Some studies have shown an inverse correlation between a diet rich in fruits. vegetables. and carotenoids and a low incidence of different types of cancer. Lycopene. the predominant carotenoid found in tomatoes. exhibits a high antioxidant capacity and has been shown to prevent cancer. as evidenced by clinical trials and studies in cell culture and animal models. In vitro studies have shown that lycopene treatment can selectively arrest cell growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells without affecting normal cells. In vivo studies have revealed that lycopene treatment inhibits tumour growth in the liver. lung. prostate. breast. and colon. Clinical studies have shown that lycopene protects against prostate cancer. One of the main challenges in cancer prevention is the integration of new molecular findings into clinical practice. Thus. the identification of molecular biomarkers associated with lycopene levels is essential for improving our understanding of the mechanisms underlying its antineoplastic activity.,True,BGeGwYMAAAAJ:YohjEiUPhakC,113,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/705121/abs/,5834997921832473862,/scholar?cites=5834997921832473862,,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/705121/abs/,0,0,0

Moreover. luciferase assays demonstrated that ectopic expression of the P2Y13 receptor in neuroblastoma N2A cells resulted in 2MeSADP-dependent induction of antioxidant response elements from the HO-1 promoter.

In the present paper the mechanism by which NDGA scavenges •OH is addressed performing a combined experimental and theoretical investigation. We found that NDGA protects. in a concentration-dependent way. bovine serum albumin and DNA from the damage induced by •OH generated by the Fenton reaction. In addition. the NDGA + •OH reaction is predicted to be diffusion-controlled. The first step of this reaction is proposed to occur mainly by a sequential electron proton transfer from NDGA to •OH generating a neutral radical of NDGA. which after a second oxidation step gives a diradical that after a cascade sequential complex reaction produces a cyclic compound.

The earliest detected modes of zinc coordination in biology were different. however. The ligands associated with catalytic zinc ions in hundreds of enzymes proved to be nitrogen and oxygen. ie. histidine and glutamate/aspartate. while the sulfur of cysteine served as a ligand less frequently (1. 2). The discovery of the so-called zinc fingers in the early 1980s changed this balance. Their coordination of zinc involves two cysteine and two histidine ligands (ZnS2N2 coordination)(3. 4). Now “zinc finger” is a generic term that includes motifs with one histidine and three cysteine ligands (ZnS3N) and with cysteine ligands only (ZnS4).

Zinc binding to proteins requires an adequate supply of zinc and intact molecular mechanisms for redistributing zinc ions to make them available at the right time and location. Several dozen gene products participate in this process. in which interactions between zinc and sulfur donors determine the mobility of zinc and establish coupling between cellular redox state and zinc availability. Specifically. the redox properties of metallothionein and its apoprotein thionein are critical for buffering zinc ions and for controlling fluctuations in the range of picomolar concentrations of “free” zinc ions in cellular signaling.

We do not know all the essential elements with certainty and we know even less about the functions of apparently non-essential elements. In this article. I discuss a basis for a biological periodic system of the elements and that biochemistry should include the elements that are traditionally part of inorganic chemistry and not only those that are in the purview of organic chemistry. A biological periodic system of the elements needs to specify what “essential” means and to which biological species it refers. It represents a snapshot of our present knowledge and is expected to undergo further modifications in the future. An integrated approach of biometal sciences called metallomics is required to understand the interactions of metal ions. the biological functions that their chemical structures acquire in the biological system. and how their usage is fine-tuned in biological species and in populations of species with genetic variations (the variome).

Molecular targets of zinc are intracellular. however. because otherwise ineffective zinc concentrations alter the extent of protein phosphorylation only in the presence of the ionophore pyrithione. The tight inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases by zinc (nanomolar inhibition constants) is likely responsible for the known insulinomimetic effects of zinc ions. which increase net phosphorylation of the insulin/IGF-1-receptors and activate their signaling cascades.

Together with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+. Zn 2+ covers biological regulation with redox-inert metal ions over many orders of magnitude in concentrations. The regulatory functions of zinc ions. together with their functions as a cofactor in about three thousand zinc metalloproteins. impact virtually all aspects of cell biology.

This molecular property links the binding and release of zinc in metallothionein (MT) to the cellular redox state [Maret W. & Vallee B.L. (1998) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA95. 3483–3488]. Biological disulfides such as glutathione disulfide (GSSG) oxidize MT with concomitant release of zinc. while glutathione (GSH) reduces the oxidized protein to thionein. which then binds to available zinc. Neither of these two redox processes is very efficient. even at high concentrations of GSSG or GSH. However. the GSH/GSSG redox pair can efficiently couple with the MT/thionein system in the presence of a selenium compound that has the capacity to form a catalytic selenol(ate).

It is now understood that the control of cellular zinc homeostasis includes buffering of Zn 2+ ions at picomolar concentrations. extensive subcellular re-distribution of Zn 2+. the loading of exocytotic vesicles with zinc species. and the control of Zn 2+ ion signalling. In parallel. characteristic features of human MTs became known: their graded affinities for Zn 2+ and the redox activity of their thiolate coordination environments. Unlike the single species that structural models of mammalian MTs describe with a set of seven divalent or eight to twelve monovalent metal ions. MTs are metamorphic. In vivo. they exist as many species differing in redox state and load with different metal ions. The functions of mammalian MTs should no longer be considered elusive or enigmatic because it is now evident that the reactivity and coordination dynamics of MTs with Zn 2+ and Cu+ match the biological requirements for controlling—binding and delivering—these cellular metal ions. thus completing a 60-year search for their functions. MT represents a unique biological principle for buffering the most competitive essential metal ions Zn 2+ and Cu+. How this knowledge translates to the function of other families of MTs awaits further insights into the specifics of how their properties relate to zinc and copper metabolism in other organisms.

Glutathione plays a role not only in antioxidative defense and in maintaining the reducing environment of the cytosol. Many of the known glutathione-dependent processes are directly related to the specific lifestyle of the parasite. Reduced glutathione (GSH) supports rapid cell growth by providing electrons for deoxyribonucleotide synthesis and it takes part in detoxifying heme. a product of hemoglobin digestion. Free radicals generated in the parasite can be scavenged in reaction sequences involving the thiyl radical GS as well as the thiolate GS. As a substrate of glutathione S-transferase. glutathione is conjugated to nondegradable compounds including antimalarial drugs.

The crystal structure of modified human GR at 1.9-Å resolution provides the first picture of protein inactivation by peroxynitrite and reveals that this is due to the exclusive nitration of 2 Tyr residues (residues 106 and 114) at the glutathione disulfide-binding site. The selective nitration explains the impairment of binding the peptide substrate and thus the nearly 1000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of glutathione reductase observed at physiologic pH.

Amazingly. protozoa lack most of the components of the highly sophisticated apoptotic machinery studied in metazoa to date. The apoptosis-like cell death of parasitic protozoa might therefore be exploited for drug development with the aim of selectively switching on the programmed cell death of the parasite. but not of the host.

All three proteins belong to the thioredoxin superfamily and share a conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motif at the active site. Only a few of their target proteins. which are likely to be involved in redox reactions. are currently known. The aim of the present study was to extend our knowledge of the Trx-.

By contrast. the much more complex social odours of mammals provide a broad range of information about the individual owner and stimulate individual-specific responses that are modulated by learning. How do mammals use such odours to coordinate important social interactions such as sexual attraction while allowing for individual-specific choice? We hypothesized that male mouse urine contains a specific pheromonal component that invokes inherent sexual attraction to the scent and which also stimulates female memory and conditions sexual attraction to the airborne odours of an individual scent owner associated with this pheromone.

We show that darcin. an involatile protein sex pheromone in male mouse urine. can rapidly condition preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent. Learned spatial preference is conditioned through contact with darcin in a single trial and remembered for approximately 14 days.

Whilst important information about MUP functionality has been gained in recent years. the gene cluster is poorly studied in terms of structure. genic polymorphism and evolution. We combine targeted sequencing. manual genome annotation and phylogenetic analysis to compare the Mup clusters of C57BL/6J and 129 strains of mice. We describe organizational heterogeneity within both clusters: a central array of cassettes containing Mup genes highly similar at the protein level. flanked by regions containing Mup genes displaying significantly elevated divergence. Observed genomic rearrangements in all regions have likely been mediated by endogenous retroviral elements. Mup loci with coding sequences that differ between the strains are identified - including a gene/pseudogene pair - suggesting that these inbred lineages exhibit variation that exists in wild populations. We have characterized the distinct MUP profiles in the urine of both strains by mass spectrometry. The total MUP phenotype data is reconciled with our genomic sequence data. matching all proteins identified in urine to annotated genes.

We have conducted a detailed study of the polymorphic variation within a geographically constrained island population. analyzing the MUP heterogeneity by isoelectric focusing and analytical ion exchange chromatography. Several MUPs were purified in sufficient quantities for analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of endopeptidase Lys-C peptide maps. The results of such analyses permitted the identification of three new MUP allelic variants. In each of these proteins. the sites of variation were located to a restricted segment of the polypeptide chain. projecting to a patch on the surface of the protein. and connected to the central lipocalin calyx through the polypeptide backbone.

Pretreatment of 32P-labelled human neutrophils with 100 nM wortmannin totally abolished fMLP-mediated PtdInsP3 production. raised PtdInsP2 levels. and did not affect cellular PtdInsP and PtdIns contents.

Here we report that FGF-2 prevented etoposide-induced apoptosis in H-510 SCLC cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling did not mediate this effect because FGF-2 failed to activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or protein kinase B. In contrast. the mitogen-activated extracellularly regulated kinase kinase (MEK) was crucial for this response because its inhibition abolished the prosurvival properties of FGF-2. Moreover. in H-69 SCLC cells. the failure of FGF-2 to prevent etoposide-induced apoptosis correlated with uncoupling from MEK activation.

PI3K isoforms play an essential role in the signal transduction events activated by cell surface receptors including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are eight known PI3K isoforms in humans. which have been subdivided into three classes (I-III).

Here we show that in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. specific growth factor receptors such as c-Kit associate with lipid rafts and that these domains play a critical role in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling. The class IA p85/p110α associated with Src in lipid rafts and was activated by Src in vitro. Lipid raft integrity was essential for Src activation in response to stem cell factor (SCF) and raft disruption selectively inhibited activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt in response to SCF stimulation.

Simvastatin profoundly impaired basal and growth factor-stimulated SCLC cell growth in vitro and induced apoptosis. SCLC cells treated with simvastatin were sensitized to the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Moreover. SCLC tumour growth in vivo was inhibited by simvastatin. These responses correlated with the inhibition of stem cell factor (SCF)-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk). protein kinase B (PKB) and ribosomal S6 kinase by simvastatin. Constitutive activation of the Erk pathway was sufficient to rescue SCLC cell from the effects of simvastatin.

Therefore. the role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling in growth and survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was investigated. Expression of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and its ligand IGF-I were detected in a panel of human AML blasts and cell lines. IGF-I and insulin promoted the growth of human AML blasts in vitro and activated the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathways.

Deregulation of the IGF signaling pathway frequently occurs in human cancer and involves the establishment of autocrine loops comprising IGF-1 or -2 and/or IGF-1R over-expression. Epidemiologic studies have documented a link between elevated IGF levels and the development of solid tumors. such as breast. colon and prostate cancer. Anticancer strategies targeting the IGF signaling system involve two main approaches. namely neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of the IGF-1R kinase activity. There are numerous reports describing anti-tumor activity of these agents in pre-clinical models of major human cancers. In addition. multiple clinical trials have started to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selected IGF-1R inhibitors. in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens or other targeted agents in cancer patients.

We were interested in gaining further insight into the potential of targeting PI3K isoforms as a novel anti-tumor approach in glioblastoma. Consistent expression of the PI3K catalytic isoform PI3K p110α was detected in a panel of glioblastoma patient samples. In contrast. PI3K p110β expression was only rarely detected in glioblastoma patient samples. The expression of a module comprising the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/PI3K p110α/phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein (p-S6) was correlated with shorter patient survival. Inhibition of PI3K p110α activity impaired the anchorage-dependent growth of glioblastoma cells and induced tumor regression in vivo. Inhibition of PI3K p110α or PI3K p110β also led to impaired anchorage-independent growth. a decreased migratory capacity of glioblastoma cells. and reduced the activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. These effects were selective. because targeting of PI3K p110δ did not result in a comparable impairment of glioblastoma tumorigenic properties.

Unlike the evidence supporting a role for NOTCH receptors in MB development. the pathological functions of NOTCH ligands remain largely unexplored. By examining the expression in large cohorts of MB primary tumors. and in established in vitro MB models. this research study demonstrates that MB cells bear abnormal levels of distinct NOTCH ligands. We explored the potential association between NOTCH ligands and the clinical outcome of MB patients. and investigated the rational of inhibiting NOTCH signaling by targeting specific ligands to ultimately provide therapeutic benefits in MB. The research revealed a significant over-expression of ligand JAG1 in the vast majority of MBs. and proved that JAG1 mediates pro-proliferative signals via activation of NOTCH2 receptor and induction of HES1 expression. thus representing an attractive therapeutic target. Furthermore. we could identify a clinically relevant association between ligand JAG2 and the oncogene MYC. specific for MYC-driven Group 3 MB cases. We describe for the first time a mechanistic link between the oncogene MYC and NOTCH pathway in MB. by identifying JAG2 as MYC target. and by showing that MB cells acquire induced expression of JAG2 through MYC-induced transcriptional activation.

PQ mainly accumulates in the lung (pulmonary concentrations can be 6 to 10 times higher than those in the plasma). where it is retained even when blood levels start to decrease. The pulmonary effects can be explained by the participation of the polyamine transport system abundantly expressed in the membrane of alveolar cells type I. II. and Clara cells.

This review discusses the redox‐sensitive signalling pathways that are responsible for this ROS‐induced skeletal muscle adaptation. We begin with a discussion of the sites of ROS production in skeletal muscle fibres. This is followed by an overview of the putative redox‐sensitive signalling pathways that promote skeletal muscle adaptation. Specifically. this discussion highlights redox‐sensitive kinases. phosphatases and the transcription factor nuclear factor‐κB. We also discuss the evidence that connects redox signalling to skeletal muscle adaptation in response to increased muscular activity (i.e. exercise training) and during prolonged periods of muscular inactivity (i.e. immobilization).

The role of genetic predisposition in PD has been increasingly acknowledged and a number of relevant genes have been identified (e.g.. genes encoding α-synuclein. parkin. and dardarin). while the search for environmental factors that influence the pathogenesis of PD has only recently begun to escalate. In recent years. the investigation on paraquat (PQ) toxicity has suggested that this herbicide might be an environmental factor contributing to this neurodegenerative disorder.

For fatigue due to prolonged exercise. hypoxic conditions and the formation of free oxygen radicals seem to be of aetiological importance. resulting in an elevated lysosomal activity. Eccentric exercise of high intensity rather results in a mechanical stress to the fibres. Although these different mechanisms can be discerned experimentally. both result in similar impairments of muscle function.

New evidence confirms that there is an inverse dose-response relationship between physical activity and cardiovascular disease and mortality risk. However. participation in moderate to vigorous physical activity may not fully attenuate the independent effect of sedentary activities on increased risk for cardiovascular diseases. Physical activity also plays an important role in secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases by reducing the impact of the disease. slowing its progress and preventing recurrence.

Sports Med. 14 (1993) 440—443 Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart New York (1) represent evidently similarities (11). which may suggest the involvement of similar if not same physiopathological mechanisms of those two experimental conditions.It has been shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are vastly formed in muscle under conditions of strenu-ous exercise (16. 23. 30) as well as after ischemia/reperfusion (7. 17. 26). These ROS generally have a toxic action on tissues (8) and they can be liberated by endothelial cells (12. 15. 28). In this case. xanthine oxidase (XO) existing in vivo predominantly as an NAD dependent dehydrogenase (13. 29) in the capillary endothelium is functionally altered under certain conditions: proteolysis. increase of temperature. anaerobiosis. oxidation of thiol groups (22. 27). Many such conditions exist as well during/after exercise as during ischemia/reperfusion. The functional alterations of XO under such circumstances consist of a utilization of oxygen as an electron receptor thereby transforming XO into an oxygen-dependent oxidase (12. 15. 18). In this situation. the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) oxidizes proportionally to the ROS concentration (16. 21. 23) and its depletion can be used as a marker for oxidative stress.,True,jV5pT7kAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC,145,https://www.academia.edu/download/48333718/Endothelium-Derived_Oxidative_Stress_May20160826-20242-1rocl0y.pdf,818065848799418865,/scholar?cites=818065848799418865,,https://www.academia.edu/download/48333718/Endothelium-Derived_Oxidative_Stress_May20160826-20242-1rocl0y.pdf,0,0,0

Such is induced by the progressive loss of redundant components and leads to an increased susceptibility to disease and risk of death. Regarding the aging of skeletal muscle. it has been pointed out that mitochondria is a key factor behind the loss of redundancy and functionality. since this organelle has a major role in cellular homeostasis particularly at the level of the bioenergetic status. Decreased activities of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and an increased release of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria are well documented with age; it is suggested that the mitochondrial loss of function results from the increased oxidative damage to proteins. lipids. and DNA of this organelle.

Since glucose uptake during muscle contraction has been observed in the absence of insulin. the existence of an insulin-independent pathway has been suggested to explain this phenomenon. However. the exact mechanism behind the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles through the sarcolemma during muscle contraction is still unknown. Some substances. such as AMPK and calcium activated proteins. have been suggested as potential mediators but the exact mechanisms of their involvement remain to be elucidated. A hypothetical convergence point between the insulin cascade and the potential pathways triggered by muscle contraction has been suggested. Therefore. the earliest concept that two different routes exist in skeletal muscle has been progressively modified to the notion that glucose uptake is induced …,True,jV5pT7kAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC,104,https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2008-1038404,6764590877891518131,/scholar?cites=6764590877891518131,,,0,0,0

ECs differentiated from CD34+ cells appear to have superior angiogenic properties to fully differentiated ECs. such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our results indicate that the pro-survival effect of CD34+-derived ECs on CD34+ cells is mediated. at least in part. by bioactive factors released from ECs. This effect likely involves the secretion of novel cytokines. including interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). and the activation of the ERK 1/2 pathway in CD34+ cells. We also show that the endothelial differentiation of CD34+ cells in co-culture with CD34+-derived ECs is mediated by a combination of soluble and insoluble factors.

Inc.. A Wiley Company,The aggregation of α‐helix‐rich proteins into β‐sheet‐rich amyloid fibrils is associated with fatal diseases. such as Alzheimer's disease and prion disease. During an aggregation process. protein secondary structure elements—α‐helices—undergo conformational changes to β‐sheets. The fact that proteins with different sequences and structures undergo a similar transition on aggregation suggests that the sequence nonspecific hydrogen bond interaction among protein backbones is an important factor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of a polyalanine model. which is an α‐helix in its native state and observe a metastable β‐hairpin intermediate. Although a β‐hairpin has larger potential energy than an α‐helix. the entropy of a β‐hairpin is larger because of fewer constraints imposed by the hydrogen bonds.

It was suggested that protein homologs and analogs originate from a common ancestor and diverge in their distinct evolutionary time scales. emerging as a consequence of the physical properties of the protein sequence space. Although a number of studies have determined key signatures of protein family organization. the sequence-structure factors that differentiate the two evolution-related protein families remain unknown. Here. we stipulate that subtle structural changes. which appear due to accumulating mutations in the homologous families. lead to distinct packing of the protein core and. thus. novel compositions of core residues. The latter process leads to the formation of distinct families of homologs. We propose that such differentiation results in the formation of analogous families. To test our postulate. we developed a molecular modeling and design toolkit. Medusa. to computationally design protein sequences that correspond to the same fold family. We find that analogous proteins emerge when a backbone structure deviates only 1–2 Å root-mean-square deviation from the original structure. For close homologs. core residues are highly conserved. However. when the overall sequence similarity drops to ~25%–30%. the composition of core residues starts to diverge. thereby forming novel families of protein homologs.

For the case of two proteins. we observe two possible aggregation conformations: the closed form dimer and the open aggregation state. The closed dimer is formed by “domain swapping”—the two proteins exchange their RT-loops. All the hydrophobic residues are buried inside the dimer so proteins cannot further aggregate into elongated amyloid fibrils. We find that the open structure—stabilized by backbone hydrogen bond interactions—packs the RT-loops together by swapping the two strands of the RT-loop. The packed RT-loops form a β-sheet structure and expose the backbone to promote further aggregation.

118799,The complex molecular biology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),2012,Rachel L Redler and Nikolay V Dokholyan,107,,,215-262,Academic Press,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that causes selective death of motor neurons followed by paralysis and death. A subset of ALS cases is caused by mutations in the gene for Cu. Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). which impart a toxic gain of function to this antioxidant enzyme. This neurotoxic property is widely believed to stem from an increased propensity to misfold and aggregate caused by decreased stability of the native homodimer or a tendency to lose stabilizing posttranslational modifications. Study of the molecular mechanisms of SOD1-related ALS has revealed a complex array of interconnected pathological processes. including glutamate excitotoxicity. dysregulation of neurotrophic factors and axon guidance proteins. axonal transport defects. mitochondrial dysfunction. deficient protein quality control. and aberrant RNA processing.

It has been conjectured that conformations constituting the TSE in many proteins are the expanded and distorted forms of the native state built around a specific folding nucleus. This view has been supported by a number of on-lattice and off-lattice simulations. Here we report a direct observation and characterization of the TSE by molecular dynamic folding simulations of the C-Src SH3 domain. a small protein that has been extensively studied experimentally.

Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is implicated in neuronal death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Each SOD1 monomer binds to 1 copper and 1 zinc ion and maintains its disulfide bond (Cys-57–Cys-146) in the reducing cytoplasm of cell. Mounting experimental evidence suggests that metal loss and/or disulfide reduction are important for initiating misfolding and aggregation of SOD1. To uncover the role of metals and the disulfide bond in the SOD1 folding. we systemically study the folding thermodynamics and structural dynamics of SOD1 monomer and dimer with and without metal binding and under disulfide-intact or disulfide-reduced environments in computational simulations.

Disease age of onset is correlated with the polyQ insert length above a critical value of 35–40 glutamines. The aggregation kinetics of isolated polyQ peptides in vitro also shows a similar critical-length dependence. While recent experimental work has provided considerable insights into polyQ aggregation. the molecular mechanism of aggregation is not well understood. Here. using computer simulations of isolated polyQ peptides. we show that a mechanism of aggregation is the conformational transition in a single polyQ peptide chain from random coil to a parallel β-helix. This transition occurs selectively in peptides longer than 37 glutamines. In the β-helices observed in simulations. all residues adopt β-strand backbone dihedral angles. and the polypeptide chain coils around a central helical axis with 18.5 ± 2 residues per turn. We also find that mutant polyQ peptides with proline-glycine inserts show formation of antiparallel β-hairpins in their ground state. in agreement with experiments.

When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36–40 repeats. XN1 can readily form amyloid aggregates similar to those associated with disease. Many experiments suggest that misfolding of monomeric XN1 plays an important role in the length-dependent aggregation. Elucidating the misfolding of a XN1 monomer can help determine the molecular mechanism of XN1 aggregation and potentially help develop strategies to inhibit XN1 aggregation. The flanking sequences surrounding the polyQ region can play a critical role in determining the structural rearrangement and aggregation mechanism of XN1. Few experiments have studied XN1 in its entirety. with all flanking regions. To obtain structural insights into the misfolding of XN1 toward amyloid aggregation. we perform molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric XN1 with full flanking regions. a variant missing the polyproline regions. which are hypothesized to prevent aggregation. and an isolated polyQ peptide (Qn). For each of these three constructs. we study glutamine repeat lengths of 23. 36. 40 and 47.

Although SOD1 dimer dissociation is a known requirement for its aggregation. the common structural basis for diverse FALS mutations resulting in aggregation is not fully understood. In molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type SOD1 and three structurally diverse FALS mutants (A4V. G37R. and H46R). we find that a common effect of mutations on SOD1 dimer is the mutation-induced disruption of dynamic coupling between monomers. In the wild-type dimer. the principal coupled motion corresponds to a “breathing motion” of the monomers around an axis parallel to the dimer interface. and an opening–closing motion of the distal metal-binding loops. These coupled motions are disrupted in all three mutants …,True,FDSJzcQAAAAJ:dhFuZR0502QC,100,https://www.pnas.org/content/103/9/3147.short,4273688252099102658,/scholar?cites=4273688252099102658,,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/103/9/3147.full.pdf,0,0,0

Precise regulation of ASL volume is essential for efficient mucus clearance and too great a reduction in ASL volume causes mucus dehydration and mucus stasis which contributes to chronic airway infection. The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is the rate-limiting step that governs Na+ absorption in the airways. Recent in vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that ENaC is a critical determinant of ASL volume and hence mucus clearance. ENaC must be cleaved by either intracellular furin-type proteases or extracellular serine proteases to be active and conduct Na+. and this process can be inhibited by protease inhibitors. ENaC can be regulated by multiple pathways. and once proteolytically cleaved …,True,FDSJzcQAAAAJ:CHSYGLWDkRkC,99,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-010-0827-z,10393181138174919620,/scholar?cites=10393181138174919620,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2955882/,0,0,0

Its assembly is further perturbed by the deletion of F508 from the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) responsible for most cystic fibrosis. The mutant polypeptide is recognized by cellular quality control systems and is proteolyzed. CFTR NBD1 contains a 32-residue segment termed the regulatory insertion (RI) not present in other ATP-binding cassette transporters. We report here that RI deletion enabled F508 CFTR to mature and traffic to the cell surface where it mediated regulated anion efflux and exhibited robust single chloride channel activity.

Various environmental stresses lead to excessive production of ROS causing progressive oxidative damage and ultimately cell death. Despite their destructive activity. they are well-described second messengers in a variety of cellular processes. including conferment of tolerance to various environmental stresses. Whether ROS would serve as signaling molecules or could cause oxidative damage to the tissues depends on the delicate equilibrium between ROS production. and their scavenging. Efficient scavenging of ROS produced during various environmental stresses requires the action of several nonenzymatic as well as enzymatic antioxidants present in the tissues. In this paper. we describe the generation. sites of production and role of ROS as messenger molecules as well as inducers of oxidative damage. Further. the antioxidative defense mechanisms operating in the cells for scavenging of ROS overproduced under various stressful conditions of the environment have been discussed in detail.,True,S76rQVEAAAAJ:KxtntwgDAa4C,3286,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/217037.pdf,16684379832323898012,/scholar?cites=16684379832323898012,,http://downloads.hindawi.com/archive/2012/217037.pdf,0,0,0
118826,Lead toxicity in plants,2005,Pallavi Sharma and Rama Shanker Dubey,17,Brazilian journal of plant physiology,1,35-52,Sociedade Brasileira de Fisiologia Vegetal,Contamination of soils by heavy metals is of widespread occurrence as a result of human. agricultural and industrial activities. Among heavy metals. lead is a potential pollutant that readily accumulates in soils and sediments. Although lead is not an essential element for plants. it gets easily absorbed and accumulated in different plant parts. Uptake of Pb in plants is regulated by pH. particle size and cation exchange capacity of the soils as well as by root exudation and other physico-chemical parameters. Excess Pb causes a number of toxicity symptoms in plants e.g. stunted growth. chlorosis and blackening of root system. Pb inhibits photosynthesis. upsets mineral nutrition and water balance. changes hormonal status and affects membrane structure and permeability. This review addresses various morphological. physiological and biochemical effects of Pb toxicity and also strategies adopted by plants for Pb-detoxification and developing tolerance to Pb. Mechanisms of Pb-detoxification include sequestration of Pb in the vacuole. phytochelatin synthesis and binding to glutathione and aminoacids etc. Pb tolerance is associated with the capacity of plants to restrict Pb to the cell walls. synthesis of osmolytes and activation of antioxidant defense system. Remediation of soils contaminated with Pb using phytoremediation and rhizofiltration technologies appear to have great potential for cleaning of Pb-contaminated soils.,True,S76rQVEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C,1707,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1677-04202005000100004&script=sci_arttext,2782626472421165662,/scholar?cites=2782626472421165662,,https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1677-04202005000100004&script=sci_arttext,0,0,0

118839,Manganese-excess induces oxidative stress. lowers the pool of antioxidants and elevates activities of key antioxidative enzymes in rice seedlings,2011,Sarita Srivastava and RS Dubey,64,Plant Growth Regulation,1,1-16,Springer Netherlands,Manganese (Mn) is an essential element for plant growth but in excess. specially in acidic soils. it can become phytotoxic. In order to investigate whether oxidative stress is associated with the expression of Mn toxicity during early seedling establishment of rice plants. we examined the changes in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). oxidative stress induced an alteration in the level of non-enzymic antioxidants and activities of antioxidative enzymes in rice seedlings grown in sand cultures containing 3 and 6 mM MnCl2.

118840,Protein synthesis by plants under stressful conditions,1999,RS Dubey,2,Handbook of plant and crop stress,,365-397,Marcel Dekker New York,Environmental stresses present major challenges in our quest to achieve sustainable food production. The reactions of plants to environmental stresses are complex and involve many kinds of physiological and biochemical responses. Such reactions are initiated by plants growing in stressed environments to overcome. avoid. or neutralize the effects of stress. Tolerance or sensitivity toward a particular stressful condition depends on the genetic and biochemical make-up of the species. Much attention has been focused during recent years to evolve crop species with adaptibility built into their genetic and biochemical make-up toward various stressful environments. Plants are unable to express their full genetic potential for production when subjected to stressful environments [1]. Various environmental stresses cause important modifications in gene expression in plants [2]. Such modifications may lead to the accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites. alterations in the behaviors of many enzymes. overall changes in protein synthesis. and. of particular interest. synthesis of new sets of proteins which are specific to the particular type of stress [3]. It has been shown that different environmental stresses induce the synthesis of new proteins in plants. which possibly provide evolutionary value to the plants for enhanced survival under adverse environmental situations. The synthesis of such stress-induced proteins has been well documented under salinity stress [4–10]. osmotic stress [6. 11–17]. heat shock [2. 18–21]. low-temperature treatment [22–26]. anaerobiosis [27–29]. infection with pathogens [30–35]. wounding [34–38]. gaseous pollutants [39 …,True,S76rQVEAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC,172,https://www.academia.edu/download/34374917/HANDBOOK_OF_PLANT_AND_CROP_STRESS_2ND_EDITION.pdf#page=376,8446882397543804291,/scholar?cites=8446882397543804291,,https://www.academia.edu/download/34374917/HANDBOOK_OF_PLANT_AND_CROP_STRESS_2ND_EDITION.pdf#page=376,0,0,0

118845,Physiological mechanisms of nitrogen absorption and assimilation in plants under stressful conditions,1995,RS Dubey and Mohammed Pessarakli,,Handbook of plant and crop physiology,,605-625,Marcel Dekker,Nitrogen is one of the most essential elements for plant growth and development. It is a constituent of many biomolecules such as proteins. nucleic acids. amino acids. coenzymes. vitamins. and pigments. Because of its high requirement by plants and its complete absence in the bedrock. it has a special place in plant nutrition. Nitrogen supply in the soil is often the most important factor limiting plant growth and yield. In the soil. N availability is due to the application of N fertilizers. biological action of N2 fixing organisms. or natural fertilization. With the advent of modern agricultural practices. inorganic N fertilizers have become the major input to the soil. In our quest to achieve sustainable food production. to meet the increasing food requirements for global population. excessive uses of various forms of N fertilizers are still likely in the near future.Ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) are available forms of N that can be absorbed by plants [1. 2]. However. NO3 is the predominant form of N available to the most cultivated plants grown under normal field conditions. Availability of nitrogenous nutrients. especially NO3. is considered rate limiting for plant growth and crop production. Application of NO3 in the soil medium induces NO3 uptake and its assimilation to ammonium by assimilatory enzymes. Plants are often exposed to various kinds of harsh environmental conditions that adversely affect their growth and metabolism. Adverse environmental conditions. such as soil salinity. drought. heat. cold. and excessive heavy metal content in the soil. create considerable stress in growing plants [3] and severely affect N absorption by the roots and its assimilation …,True,S76rQVEAAAAJ:5icHVeHT4IsC,143,https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=52499d80cf57d7c23a0d7036&assetKey=AS:272152610181121@1441897646821#page=660,17626123818583474339,/scholar?cites=17626123818583474339,,https://www.researchgate.net/file.PostFileLoader.html?id=52499d80cf57d7c23a0d7036&assetKey=AS:272152610181121@1441897646821#page=660,0,0,0

Protein conformational dynamics and pharmacological evidence suggest that protein conformational states—fundamental information units (‘bits’) in biological systems—are governed by quantum events. and are thus perhaps akin to quantum bits (‘qubits’) as utilized in quantum computation. ‘Real time’ dynamic activities within cells are regulated by the cell cytoskeleton. particularly microtubules (MTs) which are cylindrical lattice polymers of the protein tubulin.

A classical φ 4 model in the presence of a constant electric field is used as a conceptual basis. It is demonstrated that kinklike excitations arise as a result of the guanosine 5’-triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis and that an intrinsic electrical force may cause them to propagate along a microtubule.

As polymers of subunit proteins (“tubulin”). which are each dipoles. microtubules are thus lattices of oriented dipoles. In general. three types of arrangements of dipoles in lattices may occur: (i) random. (ii) ferroelectric (parallel-aligned) and (iii) an intermediate weakly ferroelectric phase. which is length-dependent. Because of involvement in dynamical cell activities (movement. growth. mitosis. differentiation. etc.). models of microtubule signaling and information processing have been proposed. In these. tubulin units are assumed to represent informational “bit states” and to be coupled to intra-tubulin dipoles. In the present paper. we consider microtubules as lattice arrays of coupled local dipole states that interact with their immediate neighbors.

This suggests synaptic information is encoded and ‘hard-wired’ elsewhere. e.g. at molecular levels within the post-synaptic neuron. In long-term potentiation (LTP). a cellular and molecular model for memory. post-synaptic calcium ion (Ca2+) flux activates the hexagonal Ca2+-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII). a dodacameric holoenzyme containing 2 hexagonal sets of 6 kinase domains. Each kinase domain can either phosphorylate substrate proteins. or not (i.e. encoding one bit). Thus each set of extended CaMKII kinases can potentially encode synaptic Ca2+ information via phosphorylation as ordered arrays of binary ‘bits’. Candidate sites for CaMKII phosphorylation-encoded molecular memory include microtubules (MTs). cylindrical organelles whose surfaces represent a regular lattice with a pattern of hexagonal polymers of the protein tubulin. Using molecular mechanics modeling and electrostatic profiling. we find that spatial dimensions and geometry of the extended CaMKII kinase domains precisely match those of MT hexagonal lattices. This suggests sets of six CaMKII kinase domains phosphorylate hexagonal MT lattice neighborhoods collectively. e.g. conveying synaptic information as ordered arrays of six “bits”. and thus “bytes”. with 64 to 5.281 possible bit states per CaMKII-MT byte.

Hallmark AD neuropathology includes extracellular amyloid plaques composed largely of the amyloid-β protein (Aβ). intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyper-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (MAP-tau). and microtubule destabilization. Early-onset autosomal dominant AD genes are associated with excessive Aβ accumulation. however cognitive impairment best correlates with NFTs and disrupted microtubules. The mechanisms linking Aβ and NFT pathologies in AD are unknown. Here. we propose that sequestration of zinc by Aβ-amyloid deposits (Aβ oligomers and plaques) not only drives Aβ aggregation. but also disrupts zinc homeostasis in zinc-enriched brain regions important for memory and vulnerable to AD pathology. resulting in intra-neuronal zinc levels. which are either too low. or excessively high. To evaluate this hypothesis. we 1) used molecular modeling of zinc binding to the microtubule component protein tubulin. identifying specific. high-affinity zinc binding sites that influence side-to-side tubulin interaction. the sensitive link in microtubule polymerization and stability. We also 2) performed kinetic modeling showing zinc distribution in extra-neuronal Aβ deposits can reduce intra-neuronal zinc binding to microtubules. destabilizing microtubules.

At nearly physiological conditions. ie. in a buffer at pH 6.8 and 120 mM ionic strength. suspended microtubules moved towards the anode with an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 2.6× 10− 4 cm 2/V s. corresponding to an unbalanced negative charge of 0.19 electron charges per tubulin dimer. Strikingly. this value is lower by a factor of at least 50 than that calculated from crystallographic data for the non-assembled tubulin dimer. Moreover. the taxol-stabilized microtubules had an isoelectric point of about pH 4.2 which is significantly lower than that known for the tubulin monomers.

This statement is supported by recent experimental confirmation of photon guiding properties of a single neuron. We have investigated the interaction of mitochondrial biophotons with microtubules from a quantum mechanical point of view. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the interaction of biophotons and microtubules causes transitions/fluctuations of microtubules between coherent and incoherent states. A significant relationship between the fluctuation function of microtubules and alpha-EEG diagrams is elaborated on in this paper. We argue that the role of biophotons in the brain merits special attention.,True,vQh8WdcAAAAJ:olpn-zPbct0C,96,https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/s0219635211002622,6405758062590491137,/scholar?cites=6405758062590491137,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.3371,0,0,0

118903,The emerging physics of consciousness,2006,Jack A Tuszynski,,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Consciousness is one of the major unsolved problems in science. How do the feelings and sensations making up conscious experience arise from the concerted actions of nerve cells and their associated synaptic and molecular processes? Can such feelings be explained by modern science. or is there an entirely different kind of explanation needed? And how can this seemingly intractable problem be approached experimentally? How do the operations of the conscious mind emerge out of the specific interactions involving billions of neurons? This multi-authored book seeks answers to these questions within a range of physically based frameworks. ie. the underlying assumption is that consciousness can be understood using the intellectual potential of modern physics and other sciences. There are a number of theories of consciousness in existence. some of which are based on classical physics while some others require the use of quantum concepts. The latter ones have drawn a lot of criticism from the present-day scientific establishment while simultaneously claiming that classical approaches are doomed to failure.

As the neuronal cytoskeleton is extremely complex. it is no wonder that a startling number of neurodegenerative disorders (including but not limited to Alzheimer’s disease. Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease) share the common feature of a dysfunctional neuronal cytoskeleton. Recently. concern has been raised about a possible link between anesthesia. post-operative cognitive dysfunction. and the exacerbation of neurodegenerative disorders. Experimental investigations suggest that anesthetics bind to and affect cytoskeletal microtubules. and that anesthesia-related cognitive dysfunction involves microtubule instability. hyper-phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. and tau separation from microtubules. However. exact mechanisms are yet to be identified. In this paper the interaction of anesthetics with the microtubule subunit protein tubulin is investigated using computer-modeling methods. Homology modeling. molecular dynamics simulations and surface geometry techniques were used to determine putative binding sites for volatile anesthetics on tubulin. This was followed by free energy based docking calculations for halothane (2-bromo-2-chloro-1.1.1-trifluoroethane) on the tubulin body. and C-terminal regions for specific tubulin isotypes.

Prostate cancer patients have a >99% chance of survival past 5 y after diagnosis. and pancreatic patients have <6% chance of survival past 5 y. Because each cancer type has its own molecular signaling network. we asked if there are “signatures” embedded in these networks that inform us as to the 5-y survival. In other words. are there statistical metrics of the network that correlate with survival? Furthermore. if there are. can such signatures provide clues to selecting new therapeutic targets?

The basis for our calculations was the structure of the tubulin dimer published several years ago by Nogales et al.(1998). later refined to 3.5 Å resolution by Löwe et al.(2001). While. it appears that the alpha. beta and gamma-tubulins segregate into distinct structural families. we have found several differences in the physical properties within each group. Each of the alpha. beta and gamma-tubulin groups exhibit major differences in their net electric charge. dipole moments and dipole vector orientations. These properties could influence functional characteristics such as microtubule stability and assembly kinetics. due to their effects on the strength of protein-protein interactions. In addition to the general structural trends between tubulin isoforms. we have observed that the carboxy-termini of alpha and beta-tubulin exists in at least two stable configurations. either projecting away from the tubulin (or microtubule) surface. or collapsed onto the surface. In the latter case. the carboxy-termini form a lattice distinctly different from that of the well-known A and B lattices formed by the tubulin subunits. However. this C-terminal lattice is indistinguishable from the lattice formed when the microtubule-associated protein tau binds to the microtubule surface. Finally. we have discussed how tubulin sequence diversity arose in evolution giving rise to its particular phylogeny and how it may be used in cell-and tissue-specific expression including …,True,vQh8WdcAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC,86,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper.php?doi=10.1387/ijdb.052063jt,8415604876864571529,/scholar?cites=8415604876864571529,,http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/descarga/paper/052063jt,0,0,0

The Euler–Lagrange equations describing the kinetics of the scalar order parameter are in this case nonlinear Klein–Gordon equations. The method of symmetry reduction is systematically applied to derive all the solutions invariant under subgroups with generic orbits of codimension 1. Whenever the obtained ordinary differential equations have the Painlevé property. they can be transformed to one of two standard forms. These are then solved in terms of elliptic functions or elementary ones. This results in a large number of new exact solutions. Particularly interesting solutions are found in the immediate vicinity of the tricritical point.

FNT presumes a two-variable power-law relationship between metabolic rate and body mass. This assumption has been widely accepted in the past. but a growing body of evidence during the past quarter century has raised questions about its general validity. There is now a need for alternative theories of metabolic scaling that are consistent with empirical observations over a broad range of biological applications.

118913,Dipole interactions in axonal microtubules as a mechanism of signal propagation,1997,JA Brown and JA Tuszyński,56,Physical Review E,5,5834,American Physical Society,The microtubules (MTs) of nerve cells are stable relative to their counterparts in the rest of the body. This stability allows them to participate in cellular signaling processes. Each of the MT’s subunits. dimers of tubulin protein. has an electric dipole moment that contributes to the overall polarity of the structure. We propose that the orientation of the individual dipoles may be flipped due to a conformational change of the tubulin dimer if energy is supplied through guanosine tri-phosphate hydrolysis or via physical interactions. Thus the MT lattice may be viewed as an electric dipole lattice with some overall polarization upon which signals. in the form of dipole patterns. may be propagated through dipole interactions that induce conformational changes. As a nerve impulse propagates along a neuron (nerve cell). the neuronal MTs are subjected to a large transient electric field that interacts with the MT lattices.

However. recent experimental results and theoretical analyses have shown that thermal energy may assist. rather than disrupt. quantum coherent transport. especially in the ‘dry’ hydrophobic interiors of biomolecules. Specifically. evidence has been accumulating for the necessary involvement of quantum coherent energy transfer between uniquely arranged chromophores in light harvesting photosynthetic complexes.

V1 retinotopic electrical signals (spike-related electrical signals along classical axonal–dendritic pathways) can be converted into regulated ultraweak bioluminescent photons (biophotons) through redox processes within retinotopic visual neurons that make it possible to create intrinsic biophysical pictures during visual perception and imagery. However. the consensus opinion is to consider biophotons as by-products of cellular metabolism.

Many of these are very useful or promising agents in cancer chemotherapy. One of the most useful of these is paclitaxel. The tubulin molecule is itself an α/β heterodimer. both α- and β-tubulin monomers existing as multiple isotypes. Despite the success of paclitaxel as an anticancer drug. resistance often occurs in cancer cells and has been associated with variations in tubulin isotype expression. most notably with the increased expression of βIII-tubulin. Paclitaxel is thought to reach its binding site on β-tubulin by diffusion through nanopores in the microtubule wall.

Theoretical chemistry can offer a unique input by identifying the transition states and the associated activation barriers for elementary reaction steps. However. their determination requires intensive quantum chemical computations. and hence the theoretical exploration of complex catalytic reaction networks at solid surfaces remains a tremendous challenge. Simpler methods to rapidly determine activation energy barriers are therefore needed for a preliminary screening.The parametrization of reactive force fields is a fast and simplified solution to evaluate the total electronic energy and forces.

The initially very small amounts of molecular oxygen is believed to have been formed around 4 billion years ago by the decomposition of CO2 and water promoted by UV irradiation from the sun.[1] Molecular oxygen can be transferred between its more reactive singlet state (1O2) and its non-excited triplet state (3O2).[2] Singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) plays a significant role in several biochemical processes. For example. it is involved in the development of different diseases and biochemical oxidations.[3. 4] Furthermore. chemists have utilized photo-or chemically generated molecular 1O2 as an oxygen source for several synthetic transformations.[1. 5] For example. it is used in the formation of allylic hydroperoxides (analogous to the “ene” reaction) and to generate cyclic peroxides (analogous to a Diels–Alder-type reaction …,True,s9bnTtsAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC,118,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.200460295,2359353945386757068,/scholar?cites=2359353945386757068,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anie.200460295,0,0,0

Variation in their extracellular region leads to the large potential for recognition properties of this superfamily. This is demonstrated strikingly by the recently discovered FYN-binding CNR-protocadherins; these exhibit alternative expression of the extracellular portion. which could lead to distinct cell recognition in different neuronal populations. whereas their cytoplasmic part. and therefore intracellular interactions. is constant.

The primary translation product pro‐p21 is cytosolic and is rapidly converted to a cytosolic form (c‐p21) of higher mobility on SDS‐PAGE. c‐p21 is converted in turn to the membrane‐bound mature palmitoylated form (m‐p21) of slightly higher mobility. These processing steps are accompanied by increases in isoelectric point and in hydrophobicity as judged by Triton X‐114 partitioning. Although the increases in electrophoretic mobility and hydrophobicity precede acylation we show that mutation of Cys186. which has been shown to block acylation. also abolishes the pro‐p21 to c‐p21 conversion.

The most labile fatty acyl bonds were in the Sindbis virus PE2/E2 proteins and the most stable were in the E1 protein. Some of the fatty acids in Sindbis virus glycoproteins were reduced to the alcohol after treatment with sodium borohydride. indicating that protein-bound fatty acids could be in thiolester linkage. Sindbis virus PE2/E2 has several cysteine residues near the carboxy terminus. a region of the protein postulated to be localized on the inside (cytoplasmic face) of the bilayer. and protease digestion of microsomal membranes containing E2 protein removed a small portion of this cytoplasmic tail as well as significant amounts of the fatty acid.

Lck is post-translationally fatty acylated at its N-terminus conferring membrane targeting and concentration in plasma membrane lipid rafts. which are lipid-based organisational platforms. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows that Lck colocalises in rafts with GPI-linked proteins. the adaptor protein LAT and Ras. but not with non-raft membrane proteins including the protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45. The TCR also associates with lipid rafts and its cross-linking causes coaggregation of raft-associated proteins including Lck. but not of CD45. Cross-linking of either the TCR or rafts strongly induces specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR in the rafts. Remarkably. raft patching alone induces signalling events analogous to TCR stimulation. with the same dependence on expression of key TCR signalling molecules. Our results indicate a mechanism whereby TCR engagement promotes aggregation of lipid rafts. which facilitates colocalisation of signaling proteins including Lck. LAT. and the TCR. while excluding CD45. thereby potentiating protein tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling. We are currently testing this hypothesis as well as using imaging techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to study the dynamics of proteins and lipids in lipid rafts in living cells undergoing signaling events. Recent data show that the key phosphoinositide PI (4. 5) P2 is concentrated in T cell lipid rafts and that on stimulation of the cells it is rapidly converted to PI (3. 4. 5) P3 and diacylglycerol within rafts …,True,2TsUavMAAAAJ:4MWp96NkSFoC,121,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-97602002000200003&script=sci_arttext&tlng=p,8934736648946781719,/scholar?cites=8934736648946781719,,https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-97602002000200003&script=sci_arttext&tlng=p,0,0,0

The amplitude and duration of the cGMP signal in smooth muscle is regulated in large part by cGMP-specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE5). Previous in vitro data have suggested that both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and PKG can regulate the activity of PDE5. To test if this type of regulation is important in the intact cell. we have generated phospho-PDE5-specific antisera and have utilized isolated smooth muscle cells from mice having a disruption in the PKG I gene as well as cells from normal human smooth muscle.

Heidelberg,Nitric oxide (NO) is a multifunctional messenger in the CNS that can signal both in antero- and retrograde directions across synapses. Many effects of NO are mediated through its canonical receptor. the soluble guanylyl cyclase. and the second messenger cyclic guanosine-3′.5′-monophosphate (cGMP). An increase of cGMP can also arise independently of NO via activation of membrane-bound particulate guanylyl cyclases by natriuretic peptides. The classical targets of cGMP are cGMP-dependent protein kinases (cGKs). cyclic nucleotide hydrolysing phosphodiesterases. and cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels. The NO/cGMP/cGK signalling cascade has been linked to the modulation of transmitter release and synaptic plasticity by numerous pharmacological and genetic studies.

However. the molecular elements modulated by cyclic nucleotides in growth cones are not well understood. cGMP is a second messenger with several distinct targets including cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (cGKI). Our studies indicated that the α isoform of cGKI is predominantly expressed by sensory axons during developmental stages. whereas most spinal cord neurons are negative for cGKI. Analysis of the trajectories of axons within the spinal cord showed a longitudinal guidance defect of sensory axons within the developing dorsal root entry zone in the absence of cGKI.

In the cardiovascular system. H2S enhances vasodilation and angiogenesis. H2S-induced vasodilation is hypothesized to occur through ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP); however. we recently demonstrated that it also increases cGMP levels in tissues. Herein. we studied the involvement of cGMP-dependent protein kinase-I in H2S-induced vasorelaxation. The effect of H2S on vessel tone was studied in phenylephrine-contracted aortic rings with or without endothelium. cGMP levels were determined in cultured cells or isolated vessel by enzyme immunoassay. Pretreatment of aortic rings with sildenafil attenuated NaHS-induced relaxation. confirming previous findings that H2S is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In addition. vascular tissue levels of cGMP in cystathionine gamma lyase knockouts were lower than those in wild-type control mice. Treatment of aortic rings with NaHS. a fast releasing H2S donor. enhanced phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein in a time-dependent manner. suggesting that cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is activated after exposure to H2S. Incubation of aortic rings with a PKG-I inhibitor (DT-2) attenuated NaHS-stimulated relaxation. Interestingly. vasodilatory responses to a slowly releasing H2S donor (GYY 4137) were unaffected by DT-2. suggesting that this donor dilates mouse aorta through PKG-independent pathways.

Generation and maintenance of circadian rhythmicity rely on complex interlocked transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a set of clock genes. Among the molecular components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (mPer1 and mPer2) genes. Because the periodicity of the clock is not exactly 24 hr. it has to be adjusted periodically. The major stimulus for adjustment (resetting) of the clock is nocturnal light. It evokes activation of signaling pathways in the SCN that ultimately lead to expression of mPer1 and mPer2 genes conveying adjustment of the clock.Results: We show that mice deficient in cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII. also known as PKGII). despite regular retinal function …,True,-bNALhgAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC,104,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982203002525,457844892459316839,/scholar?cites=457844892459316839,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982203002525,0,0,0

This review is concerned with the hydrophobic interactions of such peptides with the interfacial regions of lipid bilayers. We first develop a general framework for thinking about the thermodynamics of membrane protein stability that centers on interfacial interactions and review the structural and chemical evidence that supports this interface-centered point of view.

Thus. there is a significant and urgent need for the development of new classes of antibiotics that do not induce resistance. To develop such antimicrobial compounds. we must look toward agents with novel mechanisms of action. Membrane-permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are good candidates because they act without high specificity toward a protein target. which reduces the likelihood of induced resistance. Understanding the mechanism of membrane permeabilization is crucial for the development of AMPs into useful antimicrobial agents.

This is about one-half the free energy that would result from replacing a charge pair in octanol with a pair of hydrophobic residues of moderate size.

We have hypothesized that this is due. in part. to the fact that some membrane activities. such as permeabilization. are not dependent on specific amino acid sequences or specific three-dimensional peptide structures. Instead they depend on interfacial activity: the ability of a molecule to partition into the membrane−water interface and to alter the packing and organization of lipids. Here we test that idea by taking a nonclassical approach to biomolecular engineering and design of membrane-active peptides. A 16 384-member rational combinatorial peptide library. containing peptides of 9−15 amino acids in length. was screened for soluble members that permeabilize phospholipid membranes.

Both types of studies suggest that arginine insertion into the bilayer involves substantial bilayer deformation. with multiple hydrogen bonds between the arginine guanidinium group and lipid polar groups.

We describe a method that uses fluorescence quenching arising from resonance energy transfer (“FRET”) for determining the topology of the tryptophan residues of peptides partitioned into phospholipid bilayer vesicles.

On the basis of the physical chemistry and mechanism of action of AMPs. we hypothesized that host cell interactions could contribute to a loss of activity in vivo where host cells are highly concentrated. To test this idea. we characterized AMP activity in the presence of human red blood cells (RBC). Indeed. we show that most of a representative set of natural and synthetic AMPs tested are significantly inhibited by preincubation with host cells and would be effectively inactive at physiological cell density. We studied an example broad-spectrum AMP. ARVA (RRGWALRLVLAY). in a direct. label-free binding assay.

Here we demonstrate that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p91. Through its SH2 domain. p91 directly interacts with the EGF receptor in a ligand-dependent manner. p91 is a necessary component of an EGF-induced DNA-binding factor that recognizes a previously identified regulatory element. SIE (c-sis-inducible element). in the c-fos gene promoter. Activated p91 stimulates SIE-dependent transcription in vitro. Cotransfection of an SIE-containing reporter with a p91 expression vector shows that p91 is a positive transcriptional regulator of the c-fos gene promoter.

TGF-β signaling is mediated by a group of proteins including TGF-β receptors and Smads. It is known that different cells can exhibit different sensitivities to TGF-β. Several molecular mechanisms. such as the differential expression of the receptor levels. have been suggested as contributing to these differences. Here. we report evidence for a novel mechanism of regulating TGF-β sensitivity that depends on the role of CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) in regulating the basal level of Smad3 via the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.

However. the downstream signaling pathways activated by this cytokine remain largely unknown. To identify genes that play a role in osteoclastogenesis. we used RAW 264.7 mouse monocytes as a model system for the differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts from mononucleated precursors. RAW 264.7 cells were induced with RANKL to form multinucleated giant osteoclast‐like cells (OCLs) that expressed a number of osteoclast‐specific markers and were able to form resorption pits on both calcium phosphate films and bone slices. This system was used to identify genes that are regulated by RANKL and may play a role in osteoclast differentiation.

Inc.,Reversible phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues by polypeptide growth factor–receptor protein tyrosine kinases is implicated in the control of fundamental cellular processes including the cell cycle. cell adhesion. and cell survival. as well as cell proliferation and differentiation. During the last decade. it has become apparent that receptor protein tyrosine kinases and the signaling pathways they activate belong to a large signaling network.

Microbes predominantly produce melanin pigment via tyrosinases. laccases. catecholases. and the polyketide synthase pathway. In fungi. melanin is deposited in the cell wall and cytoplasm. and melanin particles (“ghosts”) can be isolated from these fungi that have the same size and shape of the original cells. Melanin has been reported in several human pathogenic dimorphic fungi including Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Sporothrix schenckii. Histoplasma capsulatum.

Two subunits of this complex. IκB kinase α (IKKα) and IκB kinase β (IKKβ). are required for NF-κB activation. Purified recombinant IKKα and IKKβ expressed in insect cells were used to demonstrate that each protein can directly phosphorylate IκB proteins. IKKα and IKKβ were found to form both homodimers and heterodimers. Both IKKα and IKKβ phosphorylated IκB bound to NF-κB more efficiently than they phosphorylated free IκB.

In the cytosol of nonshocked cells. the dHSF is present as a monomer that cannot bind DNA. Upon stress. the dHSF enters the nucleus where it is observed to be a trimer. A novel nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in the dHSF was found to be responsible for stress-dependent nuclear entry. Deletion of the NLS prevents nuclear entry. as expected. yet surprisingly also allows constitutive oligomerization and DNA binding in the cytosol. Further analysis of the NLS by mutagenesis suggests that the two functions of nuclear entry and oligomerization are separable in that distinct residues present in the NLS are responsible for each. Mutations in certain basic residues completely block nuclear entry. as expected for a constitutive NLS.

It acquires double-stranded DNA endonuclease activity in the presence of DNA-PKcs. This double-stranded DNA endonuclease activity is critical for opening DNA hairpins in V(D)J recombination and is thought to be important for processing overhangs during the nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) process. Here we show that purified human Artemis exhibits single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity. This activity is proportional to the amount of highly purified Artemis from a gel filtration column. The activity is stimulated by DNA-PKcs and modulated by purified antibodies raised against Artemis. Moreover. the divalent cation-dependence and sequence-dependence of this single-stranded endonuclease activity is the same as the double-stranded DNA endonuclease activity of Artemis:DNA-PKcs.

We investigated the regulatory role of the serine cluster residing immediately adjacent to the HLH domain and of the serines in the NEMO/IKKγ-binding domain (NBD/γBD) in the C-terminal portion of IKKβ in MEFs deficient in IKKβ and IKKα and in yeast reconstitution system. We show that phosphorylation events at the C terminus of IKKβ can be divided into autophosphorylation of the serine cluster adjacent to the HLH domain and phosphorylation of the NBD/γBD. Autophosphorylation of the serine cluster occurs immediately after IKK activation and requires IKKγ.

Accordingly. depletion and biochemical inhibition of PFAS impair RIG-I deamidation and concomitant activation. Purified PFAS and viral homolog thereof deamidate RIG-I in vitro. Ultimately. herpesvirus hijacks activated RIG-I to avoid antiviral cytokine production; loss of RIG-I or inhibition of RIG-I deamidation results in elevated cytokine production.

In its early stages. primary tumor growth is dependent on androgens. thus generally can be controlled by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Eventually however. the disease progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). a lethal form in need of more effective treatments. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large clan of cell surface proteins that have been implicated as therapeutic targets in PCa growth and progression. The findings reported here provide intriguing evidence of a role for the newly characterized glutamate family member GPR158 in PCa growth and progression. We found that GPR158 promotes PCa cell proliferation independent of androgen receptor (AR) functionality and that this requires its localization in the nucleus of the cell. This suggests that GPR158 acts by mechanisms different from other GPCRs. GPR158 expression is stimulated by androgens and GPR158 stimulates AR expression. implying a potential to sensitize tumors to low androgen conditions during ADT via a positive feedback loop. Further. we found GPR158 expression correlates with a neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation phenotype and promotes anchorage-independent colony formation implying a role for GPR158 in therapeutic progression and tumor formation. GPR158 expression was increased at the invading front of prostate tumors that formed in the genetically defined conditional Pten knockout mouse model. and co-localized with elevated AR expression in the cell nucleus.

In the case of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). a weak transactivation function has been described to be adjacent or partly overlapping to the DNA binding domain. whereas stronger trans-acting functions are encoded by the amino and the carboxy domain. In this report we describe the phenotype produced by stochastic mutations of the zinc finger region. The mutants were obtained either by selected rearrangements of the rat GR cDNA. or by semi-random nucleotide substitutions. All the identified permissive rearrangements were confined to a region downstream from the first zinc finger (duplications starting between residue 474 and 492).

This resulted in the development of drug-resistant cells in a TNFα-dependent manner. Interestingly. although the drug-resistant cells were selected using FdUrd. they are also resistant to a number of other antimetabolites in the DNA synthesis pathway in a TNFα-dependent manner.

119332,An internally translated MAVS variant exposes its amino-terminal TRAF-binding motifs to deregulate interferon induction,2015,Arlet Minassian and Junjie Zhang and Shanping He and Jun Zhao and Ebrahim Zandi and Takeshi Saito and Chengyu Liang and Pinghui Feng,11,PLoS pathogens,7,e1005060,Public Library of Science,Activation of pattern recognition receptors and proper regulation of downstream signaling are crucial for host innate immune response. Upon infection. the NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors (IRF) are often simultaneously activated to defeat invading pathogens. Mechanisms concerning differential activation of NF-κB and IRF are not well understood. Here we report that a MAVS variant inhibits interferon (IFN) induction. while enabling NF-κB activation. Employing herpesviral proteins that selectively activate NF-κB signaling. we discovered that a MAVS variant of ~50 kDa. thus designated MAVS50. was produced from internal translation initiation. MAVS50 preferentially interacts with TRAF2 and TRAF6. and activates NF-κB. By contrast. MAVS50 inhibits the IRF activation and suppresses IFN induction. Biochemical analysis showed that MAVS50. exposing a degenerate TRAF-binding motif within its N-terminus. effectively competed with full-length MAVS for recruiting TRAF2 and TRAF6. Ablation of the TRAF-binding motif of MAVS50 impaired its inhibitory effect on IRF activation and IFN induction. These results collectively identify a new means by which signaling events is differentially regulated via exposing key internally embedded interaction motifs. implying a more ubiquitous regulatory role of truncated proteins arose from internal translation and other related mechanisms.,True,JkhRA0IAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC,7,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005060,9742688169962792041,/scholar?cites=9742688169962792041,,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005060,0,0,0

We have previously reportedthat the oxygen atom transfer from manganese porphyrin to olefin occurs via an oxo-olefin intermediate whose breakdown is therate-determining step of the catalytic cycle. Stereochemical and kinetic evidence presented here indicate that both formation of this intermediate and its subsequent breakdown to form epoxide are. in general. concerted processes. The rarely observed loss of stereoselectivity represents the presence of a minor leakage pathway in the breakdown of the oxo-olefin complex to form epoxide. Shape selective olefin epoxidation is achieved when the sterically hindered porphyrin. Mn (TMP) Cl. is used as a catalyst in the hypochlorite system.

On this basis. and on the absence of other common herne enzymes such as catalase. it was thought that Giardia lacked herne proteins. This assumption was challenged when it was discovered that the Giardia genome encodes severa! putative herne proteins. and that recombinant expression of one of them (a flavohemoglobin) yielded an active heme-containing enzyme. Here we describe the cloning and recombinant expression of a Giardia herne protein (gCVTb5) with sequence similarity to the cytochromes b5• These are small (N15 kDa) heme-binding proteins or modules of larger multidomain complexes. The gene for gCYTb5 was PCR amplified from Giardia genomic DNA. cloned into a pET-14b vector. and expressed in E. coli as a 17 kDa protein with herne bound toit. Herne is extractable from gCVTb5 by acid butanone treatment. indicating a noncovalent association between the cofactor and protein. The UV-visible and Resonance-Raman spectra of gCTYb5 in both the oxidized and reduced states resemble those of known b-type cytochromes. Sequence alignment and homology modelling of the structure identify a pair of conserved histidine residues as the axial ligands ta the herne. The oxidation-reduction potential of the protein is-165 mV (vs NHE). which is low compared ta other family members. While such cytochromes serve as electron shuttles with well-established roles in electron transfer pathways. the raies of gCYTb5 and means by which Giardia acquires herne. are not yet known.

Plusieurs régions du Canada ont récemment connu de brusques hausses de surdoses d’opioïdes ainsi que des hospitalisations et des décès connexes. Cet article traite de la mortalité liée aux opioïdes et de l'invalidité découlant d'un trouble de consomma‑tion d’opioïdes au Canada entre 1990 et 2014. à la lumière des données de l’Étude sur la charge mondiale de morbidité (ÉCMM).Méthodologie. Nous avons utilisé les données de l’ÉCMM pour décrire l'évolution (1990 à 2014) en matière de mortalité liée aux opioïdes et d’invalidité découlant d’un trouble de consommation d’opioïdes en calculant les années de vie ajustées du facteur invalidité (AVAI). les décès. les années de vie perdues (AVP) et les années vécues avec invalidité (AVI). Nous avons également comparé les taux d’AVP et d’AVAI pour 100 000 au Canada. aux États‑Unis et dans d'autres régions.Résultats. Le taux normalisé selon l’âge d’AVAI lié aux opioïdes au Canada était de 355. 5 par 100 000 en 2014. soit un taux supérieur au taux mondial de 193. 2 mais inférieur au taux de 767. 9 aux États‑Unis. Entre 1990 et 2014. le taux normalisé selon l’âge d’AVP attribuables aux opioïdes a augmenté de 142. 2% au Canada alors qu’il a diminué de 10. 1% à l’échelle mondiale. Les AVI ont contribué à une plus grande proportion du fardeau global lié aux opioïdes que les AVP. et ce. dans tous les groupes d’âge. La perte de santé a été plus importante chez les hommes que chez les femmes. et particulièrement marquée chez les 25 à 29 ans.Conclusion.

However. the critical current density required for usual spin torque switching remains stubbornly high around 10 6–10 7 A cm− 2. It would be fundamentally transformative if an electric field through a voltage could assist or accomplish the switching of ferromagnets. Here we report electric-field-assisted reversible switching in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB magnetic tunnel junctions with interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. where the coercivity. the magnetic configuration and the tunnelling magnetoresistance can be manipulated by voltage pulses associated with much smaller current densities. These results represent a crucial step towards ultralow energy switching in magnetic tunnel junctions. and open a new avenue for exploring other voltage-controlled spintronic devices.,True,4yDnsDUAAAAJ:PNUrFAEqgO4C,911,https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3171,12951246189988476113,/scholar?cites=12951246189988476113,,,0,0,0

Because of ever-increasing generation rates and the concentrations of potentially hazardous heavy metals. which may endanger the ambient environment. these solid residues are of particular concern. Thus. such issues have necessitated the study of the characterization of these solid residues. A detailed characterization of five samples of different type of ashes. collected from two types of MSW incinerators located in Shenzhen (southern China). was carried out in terms of chemical composition. morphology. mineralogy and leaching behavior.

In the heart. HSP72. the  inducible form of HSP70. has been the most intensely studied. It is well  established that HSP72 is induced with ischemia and is cardioprotective.  Overexpression of other HSPs also is protective against cardiac injury.  Recently. we observed that 17β-estradiol increases levels of HSPs in male  rat cardiac myocytes. We hypothesized that there were gender differences in  HSP72 expression in the heart secondary to estrogen. To test this hypothesis.  we examined cardiac levels of HSP72 by ELISA in male and female Sprague-Dawley  rats. In addition. three other HSPs were assessed by Western blot (HSP27.  HSP60. and HSP90).

By electrochemical measurement and sequent simulation. it is revealed that the potential of the valence band maximum at the silicon/metal interface is more negative than that of the silicon/electrolyte interface. Accordingly. holes injected from the back contact are driven preferentially to the silicon/metal interface. Consequently. silicon below metal is electrochemically etched much faster than a naked silicon surface without metal coverage. Metals such as Ag and Cu have been utilized to catalyze the electrochemical etching. Feature sizes as small as 30 nm can be achieved by metal-assisted electrochemical etching.
