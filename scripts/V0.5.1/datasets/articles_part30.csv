30000,"A comprehensive, but simple-to-use software package for executing a range of standard numerical analysis and operations used in quantitative paleontology has been developed. The program, called PAST (PAleontological STatistics), runs on standard Windows computers and is available free of charge. PAST integrates spreadsheet-type data entry with univariate and multivariate statistics, curve fitting, timeseries analysis, data plotting, and simple phylogenetic analysis. Many of the functions are specific to paleontology and ecology, and these functions are not found in standard, more extensive, statistical packages. PAST also includes fourteen case studies (data files and exercises) illustrating use of the program for paleontological problems, making it a complete educational package for courses in quantitative methods.",Øyvind Hammer and David AT Harper and Paul D Ryan,27666,4538936724623580915,Palaeontologia electronica,1,9,,PAST: Paleontological statistics software package for education and data analysis,https://paleo.carleton.ca/2001_1/past/past.pdf,4,2001,/scholar?cites=4538936724623580915,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:VOx2b1Wkg3QC

30003,"The central role of the intestinal microbiota in the progression and, equally, prevention of metabolic dysfunction is becoming abundantly apparent. The symbiotic relationship between intestinal microbiota and host ensures appropriate development of the metabolic system in humans. However, disturbances in composition and, in turn, functionality of the intestinal microbiota can disrupt gut barrier function, a trip switch for metabolic endotoxemia. This low-grade chronic inflammation, brought about by the influx of inflammatory bacterial fragments into circulation through a malfunctioning gut barrier, has considerable knock-on effects for host adiposity and insulin resistance. Conversely, recent evidence suggests that there are certain bacterial species that may interact with host metabolism through metabolite-mediated stimulation of enteric hormones and other systems outside of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the …",Elaine Patterson and Paul M Ryan and John F Cryan and Timothy G Dinan and R Paul Ross and Gerald F Fitzgerald and Catherine Stanton,196,14354772778877700296,,1087,286-300,The Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine,"Gut microbiota, obesity and diabetes",https://pmj.bmj.com/content/92/1087/286.short,92,2016,/scholar?cites=14354772778877700296,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:PbVfkCSoiPoC

The arc collided with the Laurentian margin in Early Llanvirn times to deform the Dalradian Supergroup rifted margin clastic sequence. Prior to the late Llandovery, sinistral transcurrent faulting transposed the Connemara Dalradian terrane to its present position on the “outboard” ocean ward side of the South Mayo Trough.

30028,"The westward continuation of the Highland Border fault of Scotland (HBFZ) into Ireland is problematic. It is widely thought to follow a pronounced magnetic and gravity lineament, the Fair Head-Clew Bay Line (FCL). The advantage of this interpretation is that it places all the Ordovician ophiolitic complexes and associated sedimentary basins to the south of the FCL, which would represent the contact between Laurentia and the outboard terranes. Its main shortcomings are that both the deep structure and timing of strike-slip are different on the HBFZ and FCL. In Ireland the FCL is a north-dipping feature that can be traced to the Moho on BIRPS profiles, while the HBFZ has no such signature.

Arc-continent collision is thought to have been one of the most important process involved in the growth of the continental crust over geological time, and may also play an important role in its recycling back into the mantle via subduction. Understanding the geological processes that take place during arc-continent collision is therefore of importance for our understanding of how collisional orogens evolve and how the continental crust grows or is destroyed. Furthermore, zones of arc-continent collision are producers of much of the worlds primary economic wealth in the form of minerals, so understanding the processes that take place during these tectonic events is of importance in modeling how this mineral wealth is formed and preserved. This book brings together seventeen papers that are dedicated to the investigation of the tectonic processes that take place during arc-continent collision. It is divided into four sections that deal firstly with the main players involved in any arc-continent collision; the continental margin, the subduction zone, and finally the volcanic arc and its mineral deposits. The second section presents eight examples of arc-continent collisions that range from being currently active through to Palaeoproterozoic in age. The third section contains two papers, one that deals with the obduction of large-slab ophiolites and a second that presents a wide range of physical models of …",Dennis Brown and Paul D Ryan,27,6106661645852375917,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Arc-continent collision,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=QjeululxGLoC&oi=fnd&pg=PR3&dq=info:bXuIlGk4v1QJ:scholar.google.com&ots=GEsa29IGcv&sig=UVRAwB3WSTMZC3AN1e_RmPXOUdA,,2011,/scholar?cites=6106661645852375917,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC
30051,"Structural, geophysical and metamorphic studies show that collisional orogeny thickens the crust by a factor of two or more. A large volume of continental material at the base of the orogen is, therefore, subject to eclogite facies conditions. Phase equilibration results in a loss of buoyancy and thermodynamic heating of this crustal root. This dense crustal material may be partially subducted, as in the Alps or the Himalayas, and lost to the system. Alternatively, it may rest isostatically below the Moho until it is partially exhumed during orogenic collapse, as in the Scandinavian Caledonides or the Tonbai-Dabie Mountains. Remnant orogenic roots may exist as seismically reflective mantle and provide a locus for subsequent Wilson Cycle rifting. The rate at which these phase transformations take place may have a profound buffering effect on the amount and duration of orogenic contraction.

30056,"The Neoproterozoic metasediments of northwestern Scotland were deformed during the 470 Ma Grampian orogeny. Their pre-Ordovician history has proved difficult to elucidate, due to conflicting evidence. While the stratigraphic record indicates deposition in intracontinental rift basins associated with the break-up of Rodinia, isotopic dates in the range 870–780 Ma from granite gneiss, early pegmatites and metamorphic garnets have been attributed to a Neoproterozoic ‘Knoydartian’ orogeny. Stratigraphic evidence for this orogeny is lacking, and it is not represented elsewhere on the Laurentian margin. An alternative interpretation is that much of the Knoydartian history can be related to extensional, not collisional processes.

An earlier complex collided with this hitherto passive margin in the mid-Ordovician during the Grampian Orogeny. Subsequently, arc magmatism developed along the Laurentian margin and continued until the late Silurian collision between Laurentian and Avalonia. The Ordovician volcanic and sedimentary rocks comprising the South Connemara Group lie along the Southern Uplands Fault, the terrane boundary separating these two arc complexes.

30062,"Refrigerators and freezers in Australia have been subjected to mandatory energy labelling since late 1986. Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) were introduced in 1999 and were upgraded in 2005 (to match US 2001 levels). The UK, under the European Directive for energy labelling, has required energy labelling for refrigerators and freezers since January 1995 and MEPS, through a separate European Directive, were introduced in September 1999.Estimating the impact of programmes such as these that operate over very long periods provides special challenges. The existence of the program itself is now part of the base case scenario and it becomes increasingly difficult to estimate the scenario that would have occurred if labelling had not been introduced. Other external factors such as changes in technology and changes in product type (eg share of frost free) or attributes (volume) also complicate the analysis as these factors also have an indirect impact on energy consumption. Initially, data which had been collected on sales weighted trends in appliance efficiency for refrigerators and freezers in Australia was examined. A detailed methodology to assess the impacts of these programmes’ elements was developed and an impact assessment for energy labelling, MEPS 1 and MEPS 2 was undertaken. The impact of MEPS against an existing labelling backdrop was fairly straight forward.

It also examines how resource costs vary at different transaction sizes and, for merchants, how costs differ between small and large entities.The results suggest that the resource costs of the payments system have fallen as a per cent of GDP since 2006.

The results indicate that the relationship between resource and private costs varies significantly across instruments. The greater share of the overall cost is borne by merchants.

We found that both sphingosine kinases, Sphk1 and Sphk2, were expressed in spinal cord with higher levels of Sphk2 mRNA compared to Sphk1. All three Sphk2 mRNA-isoforms were present with the Sphk2.1 mRNA showing the highest relative expression. Mice deficient in Sphk2 (Sphk2-/-) showed in contrast to mice deficient in Sphk1 (Sphk1-/-) substantially lower spinal S1P levels compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In the formalin model of acute peripheral inflammatory pain, Sphk2-/- mice showed facilitation of nociceptive transmission during the late response, whereas responses to early acute pain, and the number of c-Fos immunoreactive dorsal horn neurons were not different between Sphk2-/- and wild-type mice. Chronic peripheral inflammation (CPI) caused a bilateral increase in mechanical sensitivity in Sphk2-/- mice. Additionally, CPI increased the relative mRNA expression of P2X4 receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase in the ipsilateral spinal cord of wild-type but not Sphk2-/- mice. Similarly, Sphk2-/- mice showed in contrast to wild-type no CPI-dependent increase in areas of the …",Jastrow Canlas and Phillip Holt and Alexander Carroll and Shane Rix and Paul Ryan and Lorena Davies and Dusan Matusica and Stuart M Pitson and Claire F Jessup and Ian L Gibbins and Rainer V Haberberger,14,13389801413041446934,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,,29,Frontiers,Sphingosine kinase 2-deficiency mediated changes in spinal pain processing,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2015.00029/full,8,2015,/scholar?cites=13389801413041446934,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:-3_NAp5WSNkC

30080,"A new model is proposed for the problematic preservation of an Ordovician forearc basin, which records a complete sedimentary record of arc-continent collision during the Grampian (Taconic) orogeny in the west of Ireland. The South Mayo Trough represents an arc and forearc complex developed above a subduction zone in which the slab dipped away from the Laurentian passive margin. The collision of this arc with Laurentia caused the Middle Ordovician Grampian orogeny. However, the South Mayo Trough, in the hanging wall of this collision zone, remained a site of marine sedimentation during the entire process. Early sediments show derivation from an island-arc complex, an ophiolitic backstop, and polymetamorphic trench sediments. These are conformably overlain by marine deposits derived from a more evolved arc complex and an emerging juvenile orogen. This transition is dated as being coeval with the Grampian metamorphism of the Laurentian footwall. The problem remains as to why subsidence continued in a basin on the hanging wall. It is proposed that the suppression of the expected topography is due to the nature of the Laurentian continental margin. Geophysical and geological evidence suggests that this was a volcanic margin during Neoproterozoic rifting. It is argued that the subduction of this margin caused the formation of eclogites, which reduced its buoyancy. Simple numerical models are presented which show that this is a viable mechanism for the suppression of topography during early stages of arc-continent collision and hence for the preservation of forearcs.",Paul D Ryan,11,210727894594718438,SPECIAL PAPERS-GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,,1,"Boulder, Colo.; Geological Society of America; 1999",Preservation of forearc basins during island arc-continent collision: some insights from the Ordovician of western Ireland,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=k38rn5pZDbgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=info:5oqVVeen7AIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=3UgxLKLtMZ&sig=FNQo7Xzv1fYKv3CmkdhtoGRXhz4,436,2008,/scholar?cites=210727894594718438,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC

We propose that the Silurian rocks in the east of the region suffered up to 30° clockwise rotation, increasing towards the west to approximately 70°. This newly inferred differential rotation of the Silurian rocks, about a sub-vertical axis, implies that the underlying Dalradian rocks of the Connemara Massif to the south must also have undergone clockwise rotation in late Silurian/early Devonian time.

30101,"The problem of the observed very rapid advection of heat into metamorphic thrust stacks is reviewed. Conductive models relying on the thermal relaxation of a thickened crust will not produce the observed Barrovian (medium temperature, medium pressure) assemblages within some short-lived orogens (e.g., western Ireland and Timor). Studies of the rate and timing of metamorphic mineral growth suggest that this is commonly faster than predicted by thermal relaxation. Barrovian assemblages are localised in some orogens (e.g., the Alps) but extensive in others (e.g., the Himalayas). Metamorphic mineral growth brackets deformation; consequently, slow growth is inconsistent with the rapid uplift of many orogens. Thus, no single mechanism can account for the development of Barrovian assemblages during collisional orogeny.

It is also a driver for social change (see for example) which crucially includes making higher education available and relevant to a wider section of society and improving the mobility and relevance of its graduates in the workplace. New tools are required to integrate such developments with the sector’s traditional functions of teaching and research. However, every student is different, each programme is different, each university is different and the needs of professions and nations also differ. Therefore, research leading to the development of such tools is fundamental to the development of modern society. One such tool, whose importance has recently been recognised, is the use of profiles at institutional, regional (geographic, cultural or discipline) and programme levels. Such profiles are a concise, precise and portable description of the particular academic entity. They have diverse uses ranging from ranking of institutions, aiding academic programme selection by a student, facilitating graduate mobility and as a tool for professional accreditation. We have, therefore, selected the topic of profiles for the first issue of the Tuning Journal for Higher Education.

Continental crust is thicker, more buoyant with respect to the asthenosphere, of different composition and rheology, has higher heat productivity, and is up to 20 times older than oceanic crust. An understanding of continental tectonics requires that these effects upon rigid plate behaviour to be taken into account.

30128,"Up to 4000 μg g−1 Mo exists in surface material (till/peat) in Ireland over porphyry CuMo mineralized granodiorite at Mace Head, Galway. Dispersion of Mo in surface material is controlled by high rainfall, peat, loss on ignition content of till, Eh and pH. It accumulates in organic-rich till, limonite-strained till in oxidizing conditions, and in lower horizons of deep peat in slightly reducing conditions where subsurface drainage occurs. High Mo values are often, but not necessarily, associated with Fe-enrichment and more oxidizing conditions. The mobility and widespread dispersion of Mo permits its uptake by a wide range of pasture. Much lower Mo soil levels found elsewhere in Ireland and Britain have caused molybdenosis and hypocuprosis in farm animals.

30129,"The last decade has witnessed a dramatic reversal in policy towards the finance and provision of schooling in the public sector. Since the period of budgetary expansion ground to a halt in the mid-1970s, cash limits have been used to control, and even reduce, public spending. The operating methods of educational institutions have come under scrutiny as part of a concern for increased efficiency in the public sector.The fiscal difficulties faced by public education are part of those of the public services as a whole (table 1). After growing markedly more rapidly (in terms of employment) than the private services during the years 1960-75, the public services ground to a halt in the second half of the 1970s, while in the 1980s they have contracted—at a rate faster than the growth of private services in the 1960s. The reversal has been particularly marked in education, fed by the decline since 1976 in the number of school age children. This chapter discusses a crucial deficiency in the new regime under which public education has been financed during the last decade. It has long been recognized that the intrinsic potential of formal education for productivity growth is low, with the result that the costs of providing it will, under plausible assumptions, tend to increase steadily over time. However, budgetary policy has simply ignored the problem, with adverse implications for the quality of public education in particular.",Paul Ryan,2,9916082727599515109,,,,Falmer Press Lewes,The Cost Disease and Educational Finance: The Adverse Effects of Cash Limits,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9916082727599515109&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1987,/scholar?cites=9916082727599515109,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:WzbvD7BMtBoC

30134,"To be able to form a reasonably accurate judgment of a variety of sugar cane and of the possibility of its succeeding as a field crop in any tract, it is necessary to possess accurate information on a number of points based on observations made in the field, in the laboratory, and in the mill. It is necessary to observe in the field the general crop characters; in the laboratory the sugar content and quality of the juice, and in the mill what proportion of the juice and total sugar can be extracted, and the cost of doing so. These points are of equal importance in successful cane cultivation. It is of no special advantage to handle an enormous weight of cane, if the juice is of poor quality, and it is of no use selecting a cane because of the abnormally high sucrose content of its juice, if the amount and nature of the fibre is such that it is impossible to extract a good proportion of it.It thus often happens that the most profitable cane is one which presents no exceptional features in any one respect, but a combination of moderately good qualities. The behaviour of sugar cane, when subjected to pressure between the iron rollers of the mill for the purpose of extracting the juice may be conveniently termed the “milling property.” This property is the resultant of several factors and can be determined. It is proposed to discuss in this bulletin some observations on this point which have been made during the last three years at the Experiment Stations at Partabgarh and Shahjahanpur.

30138,"Young apparent ages of thermochronometers in the high-grade rocks of the Tananao complex, eastern Taiwan have been taken as evidence that tectonic loading and heating was achieved in a short-lived “regional” metamorphic event the “Taiwan orogeny” during the still active collision of the Luzon arc with the continental margin of SE China (eg Simoes et al., 2007). However, the discovery that metamorphic zircons in a contact aureole of one of several regionally extensive intrusive granodioritic sheets have the same age as those intrusions suggests that virtually all of the high-grade metamorphism was caused instead by coalescing contact aureoles at~ 85 Ma (Wintsch et al., 2011). We test the geodynamic plausibility of this with a 2D transient finite element thermal model which assumes that the sheets were discoid with a diameter equivalent to their strike length and, as anatexis occurs in the contact aureoles, with initial temperature of 850 C. The model begins at 90 Ma with the present erosion level at 15 km, a depth consistent with biotite grade regional metamorphic conditions, with staurolite+ kyanite (no andalusite) aureole assemblages, and with metamorphic pressure estimates of 4-5 kbar. We model emplacement both as sills in horizontal strata and dipping sheets in tilted strata. Sills produce a significant increase in metamorphic gradient with depth (ie from west to east) that is not observed, suggesting tilting of the entire section occurred during Early Cretaceous loading and predates emplacement. Sheet emplacement raises initial temperatures from< 350 C between the sheets to> 450 C and to~ 600 C near the contact aureoles.

30143,"Several recent geodynamic syntheses of the Scandinavian Caledonides have concentrated upon the Trondheim region which contains an eugeoclinal sequence of Cambro-Silurian age, structurally underlain by Balto-Scandian Precambrian crystalline basement, that locally yields Ordovician fossils of Pacific/North American affinities. This apparent contrast to the commonly held view that these faunal provinces were developed only upon the Laurentian Shield has been explained in two ways. Firstly, by suggesting that here the faunal provinces traversed the axis of the Iapetus Ocean (1) or secondly, by pointing to the allochthonous nature of the strata and suggesting that they originated upon the Laur-entian Shield and were structurally emplaced onto the Baltic Shield during the Caledonian orogenic event (2).Evaluation of such hypotheses requires a detailed knowledge of the geology of the Ordovician of Trándelag in order that it might be compared with Ordovician successions further east which are known to have developed upon the Baltic Shield.

30167,"Much of the underlying demand for OTC derivatives originates from non-dealer financial institutions, such as institutional investors, or non-financial corporations (collectively referred to as ‘non-dealers’ in this article). Often, such firms use OTC derivatives to hedge financial risks arising from their investments or real economic activities. A life insurance provider, for instance, may use OTC interest rate derivatives to better match the interest rate exposure of its assets and liabilities. In some cases, a firm may also use derivatives to gain a ‘synthetic’exposure to a particular risk without transacting directly in the underlying asset, perhaps as a temporary measure to smooth investment flows. For example, a fund manager that has received an inflow of investment funds may initially use credit derivatives as an efficient and timely means of gaining a desired exposure before gradually building a position in the underlying securities. Non-dealer activity is generally intermediated by dealers, typically large financial institutions. These firms then execute offsetting transactions with other dealers to maintain a broadly balanced overall position. 1To date, both dealers and non-dealers have tended to clear OTC derivatives bilaterally; that is, the financial exposures arising from the transaction have remained between the bilateral counterparties. However, largely in response to regulatory reforms, dealers and some non-dealers are increasingly clearing their OTC derivatives through CCPs. A CCP interposes itself between the original counterparties to a financial transaction and manages the risk that either defaults before settling its obligations.

30173,"There has been much debate recently concerning the long-term (ie,> 1 my) strength of continental lithosphere. In one model, dubbed jelly sandwich, the strength resides in the crust and mantle, while in another, dubbed crème brûlée, the mantle is weak and the strength is limited to the crust.(Burov & Watts 2006)The fact that earthquakes in continental lithosphere tend to be concentrated in the crust has led to the suggestion that much of the long-term strength of the continental lithosphere resides in the crust (Jackson 2002). However, it has also been argued that the apparent considerable elastic thickness and plate-like behaviour of the continental lithosphere, as seen for example in flexural basins, requires the continental lithospheric mantle to have considerable strength (Burov & Watts 2006). Whilst Butler (2006) points out that the Himalayas perhaps exhibit both behaviours. This weakening of the continental lithospheric mantle is believed to be due to the presence of water (Maggi et al. 2000). Since the late-Archaean-early Proterozoic the creation of continental lithosphere within arcs would then be associated with the fluid fluxing and weakening of the mantle. Further'Wilson Cycle'events would only exacerbate this situation. This then leaves us with the problem as to how any continental lithosphere could behave in a'plate-like'manner. One such example is the Caledonides of Ireland, whose estimated elastic thickness is now in the order of 45km (Armstrong 1999).

30183,"A palaeomagnetic investigation of the Early-Ordovician (middle to late Arenig) sheeted dyke complexes of Meldal has revealed a complex multicomponent magneti- zation history. Three components of remanent magnetization were identified on their differing dysbilities, 'L' (low stability), 'I' (intermediate) and 'H' (high stability). The 'L' component is condidered to be a recent overprint. The 'I' component corresponds to an in-situ palaeomagnetic pole at 91.9\u00B0E, 58.6\u00B0N, Dy=12.1,DX=14.3. By comparison with a reference apparent polar wander (APW) path for Baltica, 'I' is considered to be an overprint of Jurassic age. The 'H' component (with the highest magnetic stability) was identified in two block samples from Resfjell. In in-situ form it corresponds to a palaeo-pole at 99\u00B0E, 16.4\u00B0N and in tilt-corrected form (palaeo-horizontal simply rotated into present horizontal) to a palaeo-pole at 281\u00B0E, 13.4\u00B0N. Both in-situ and tilt-corrected versions of the data fall far away from reference APW paths for Baltica and Laurentia. We suggest that a series of (Silurian) tectonic rotations, more complicated than the rotation accounted for in our simple tilt- correction procedure, are responsible for this deviation. If the remanence component does indeed pre-date complicated Silurian tectonic rotations, as its deviation from the APW paths suggests, one must consider the possibility of the remanence dating-back to when the sykes were still part of the Iapetus Ocean floor. The palaeolatitude for the dykes implied by the remanence is 12.6\u00B0S (tilt-corrected) assuming that 'H' is of reversed polarity. This choice of polarity minimises the net …",C Mac Niocaill and PD Ryan and MA Smethurst,0,,,,,,"Palaeomagnetism of the ophiolite complexes of Meldal, Sør-Trøndelag",https://openarchive.ngu.no/ngu-xmlui/handle/11250/2666110,,1995,,UCQw0TAAAAAJ:12nnf2f32iYC

Methods We designed a prospective international 7-day cohort study of outcomes following elective adult inpatient surgery in 27 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital complications. Secondary outcomes were death following a complication (failure to rescue) and death in hospital. Process measures were admission to critical care immediately after surgery or to treat a complication and duration of hospital stay. A single definition of critical care was used for all countries. Results A total of 474 hospitals in 19 high-, 7 middle- and 1 low-income country were included in the primary analysis. Data included 44 814 patients with a median hospital stay of 4 (range 2–7) days. A total of 7508 patients (16.8%) developed one or more postoperative complication and 207 died (0.5%). The overall mortality among patients who developed complications was 2.8%. Mortality following complications ranged from 2.4% for pulmonary embolism to 43.9% for cardiac arrest.

Before independence Ireland shared with the rest of the United Kingdom the social policy provisions that provided the foundations of the welfare state in the two islands: a Poor Law system, including limited health services, universal primary education, means-tested old age pensions and a rudimentary social insurance system for low-income workers.
