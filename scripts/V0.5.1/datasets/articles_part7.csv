7000,"Results are presented from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions at s= 7 and 8 TeV in the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC, using data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb− 1 at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb− 1 at 8 TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: γγ, ZZ, W+ W−, τ+ τ−, and b b¯. An excess of events is observed above the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, γγ and ZZ; a fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3±0.4 (stat.)±0.5 (syst.) GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson with spin different from one.",Serguei Chatrchyan and Vardan Khachatryan and Albert M Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and Wolfgang Adam and Ernest Aguilo and Thomas Bergauer and M Dragicevic and J Erö and C Fabjan and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and J Hammer and M Hoch and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and W Kiesenhofer and V Knünz and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and W Majerotto and I Mikulec and M Pernicka and B Rahbaran and C Rohringer and H Rohringer and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and F Szoncsó and A Taurok and W Waltenberger and G Walzel and E Widl and C-E Wulz and V Chekhovsky and I Emeliantchik and A Litomin and V Makarenko and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and A Solin and R Stefanovitch and J Suarez Gonzalez and A Fedorov and M Korzhik and O Missevitch and R Zuyeuski and M Bansal and S Bansal and W Beaumont and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and D Druzhkin and X Janssen and S Luyckx and L Mucibello and S Ochesanu and B Roland and R Rougny and M Selvaggi and Z Staykova and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and A Van Spilbeeck and F Blekman and S Blyweert and J DʼHondt and O Devroede and R Gonzalez Suarez and R Goorens and Kalogeropoulos,16309,8663470026986383108,Physics Letters B,1,30-61,North-Holland,Observation of a new boson at a mass of 125 GeV with the CMS experiment at the LHC,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269312008581,716,2012,/scholar?cites=8663470026986383108,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:aOEnwurrEPcC
7001,"The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.",Serguei Chatrchyan and G Hmayakyan and V Khachatryan and CMS Collaboration,11314,4457439396351039359,Journal of instrumentation,8,S08004,Institute of Physics Publishing,The CMS experiment at the CERN LHC,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/11075/,3,2008,/scholar?cites=4457439396351039359,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:xpFxhiwfz1QC

A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation.

7017,"The performance and strategies used in electron reconstruction and selection at CMS are presented based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns, collected in proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV at the CERN LHC. The paper focuses on prompt isolated electrons with transverse momenta ranging from about 5 to a few 100 GeV. A detailed description is given of the algorithms used to cluster energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and to reconstruct electron trajectories in the tracker. The electron momentum is estimated by combining the energy measurement in the calorimeter with the momentum measurement in the tracker. Benchmark selection criteria are presented, and their performances assessed using Z, Upsilon, and J/psi decays into electron-positron pairs. The spectra of the observables relevant to electron reconstruction and selection as well as their global efficiencies are well reproduced by Monte Carlo simulations. The momentum scale is calibrated with an uncertainty smaller than 0.3%. The momentum resolution for electrons produced in Z boson decays ranges from 1.7 to 4.5%, depending on electron pseudorapidity and energy loss through bremsstrahlung in the detector material.",CMS collaboration,1523,4042619685961453904,arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.02701,,,,Performance of electron reconstruction and selection with the CMS detector in proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV,https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02701,,2015,/scholar?cites=4042619685961453904,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:FS78WRl2AkQC

7021,"This paper describes the CMS trigger system and its performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, tau lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines the purity of the output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for offline event storage.

7032,"The success of the physics programme of the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC requires the particles created in the LHC collisions to be reconstructed and identified as accurately as possible. With the exception of the top quark, quarks and gluons produced in pp collisions develop a parton shower and eventually hadronize giving rise to jets of collimated particles observed in the CMS detector. Heavy-flavour jet identification techniques exploit the properties of the hadrons in the jet to discriminate between jets originating from b or c quarks (heavy-flavour jets) and those originating from light-flavour quarks or gluons (light-flavour jets). The CMS Collaboration presented in ref.[1] a set of b jet identification techniques used in physics analyses performed on LHC Run 1 pp collision data, collected in 2011 and 2012 at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV.

7044,"Jet production in PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV was studied with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at the LHC, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.7 μ b− 1.

The observed effect extends from the lower cut-off used in this study (jet transverse momentum= 120 GeV/c) up to the statistical limit of the available data sample (jet transverse momentum approximately 210 GeV/c).

7064,"A search is performed for heavy particle pairs produced in s= 7 TeV proton-proton collisions with 35 pb− 1 of data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The search is sensitive to squarks and gluinos of generic supersymmetry models, provided they are kinematically accessible, with minimal assumptions on properties of the lightest superpartner particle. The kinematic consistency of the selected events is tested against the hypothesis of heavy particle pair production using the dimensionless razor variable R, related to the missing transverse energy E T miss.

7080,The results of searches for supersymmetry by the CMS experiment are interpreted in the framework of simplified models. The results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.73 to 4.98 fb− 1. The data were collected at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. This paper describes the method of interpretation and provides upper limits on the product of the production cross section and branching fraction as a function of new particle masses for a number of simplified models. These limits and the corresponding experimental acceptance calculations can be used to constrain other theoretical models and to compare different supersymmetry-inspired analyses.,Serguei Chatrchyan and V Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and A Tumasyan and W Adam and E Aguilo and T Bergauer and M Dragicevic and J Erö and C Fabjan and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and W Kiesenhofer and V Knünz and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and I Mikulec and M Pernicka and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and C Rohringer and H Rohringer and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and A Taurok and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and M Bansal and S Bansal and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and S Luyckx and L Mucibello and S Ochesanu and B Roland and R Rougny and M Selvaggi and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and N Van Remortel and A Van Spilbeeck and F Blekman and S Blyweert and J D’Hondt and R Gonzalez Suarez and A Kalogeropoulos and M Maes and A Olbrechts and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Villella and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and V Dero and APR Gay and T Hreus and A Léonard and PE Marage and A Mohammadi and T Reis and L Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and Volker Adler and Kelly Beernaert and Anna Cimmino and Silvia Costantini and Guillaume Garcia and M Grunewald and Benjamin Klein and Jeremie Lellouch and Andrey Marinov and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Dirk Ryckbosch and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and S Walsh and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and G Bruno and R Castello and L Ceard and C Delaere and T Du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and V Lemaitre and J Liao and O Militaru and C Nuttens and D Pagano and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and JM Vizan Garcia and N Beliy and T Caebergs and E Daubie and GH Hammad and GA Alves and M Correa Martins Junior and T Martins and ME Pol and MHG Souza and WL Aldá Júnior and W Carvalho and A Custódio and EM Da Costa and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and H Malbouisson and M Malek and D Matos Figueiredo and L Mundim and H Nogima and WL Prado Da Silva and A Santoro and L Soares Jorge and A Sznajder and A Vilela Pereira and TS Anjos and CA Bernardes and FA Dias and TR Fernandez Perez Tomei and EM Gregores and C Lagana and F Marinho and PG Mercadante and SF Novaes and Sandra S Padula and V Genchev and P Iaydjiev and S Piperov and M Rodozov,445,9411769882814298727,Physical Review D,5,052017,American Physical Society,Interpretation of searches for supersymmetry with simplified models,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.88.052017,88,2013,/scholar?cites=9411769882814298727,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:nlKf13ul9_IC

7084,"At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at root s = 7TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb(-1). The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events.

7115,"Results on two-particle angular correlations for charged particles emitted in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV are presented. The analysis uses two million collisions collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The correlations are studied over a broad range of pseudorapidity, eta, and full azimuth, phi, as a function of charged particle multiplicity and particle transverse momentum, pt. In high-multiplicity events, a long-range (2< abs (Delta (eta))< 4), near-side (Delta (phi) approximately 0) structure emerges in the two-particle Delta (eta)-Delta (phi) correlation functions. This is the first observation of such correlations in proton-nucleus collisions, resembling the ridge-like correlations seen in high-multiplicity pp collisions at sqrt (s)= 7 TeV and in AA collisions over a broad range of center-of-mass energies. The correlation strength exhibits a pronounced maximum in the range of pt= 1-1.5 GeV and an approximately linear increase with charged particle multiplicity for high-multiplicity events.

A simultaneous maximum likelihood fit to the measured kinematic distributions near the resonance peak and above the Z-boson pair production threshold leads to an upper limit on the Higgs boson width of Γ H< 22 MeV at a 95% confidence level, which is 5.4 times the expected value in the standard model at the measured mass of m H= 125.6 GeV.",Vardan Khachatryan and Albert M Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and Wolfgang Adam and Thomas Bergauer and Marko Dragicevic and Janos Erö and Christian Fabjan and Markus Friedl and Rudolf Fruehwirth and Vasile Mihai Ghete and Christian Hartl and Natascha Hörmann and Josef Hrubec and Manfred Jeitler and Wolfgang Kiesenhofer and Valentin Knünz and Manfred Krammer and Ilse Krätschmer and Dietrich Liko and Ivan Mikulec and Dinyar Rabady and Babak Rahbaran and Herbert Rohringer and Robert Schöfbeck and Josef Strauss and Anton Taurok and Wolfgang Treberer-Treberspurg and Wolfgang Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and Vladimir Mossolov and Nikolai Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and Sara Alderweireldt and Monika Bansal and Sunil Bansal and Tom Cornelis and Eddi A De Wolf and Xavier Janssen and Albert Knutsson and Sten Luyckx and Silvia Ochesanu and Benoit Roland and Romain Rougny and Merijn Van De Klundert and Hans Van Haevermaet and Pierre Van Mechelen and Nick Van Remortel and Alex Van Spilbeeck and Freya Blekman and Stijn Blyweert and Jorgen D'Hondt and Nadir Daci and Natalie Heracleous and James Keaveney and Steven Lowette and Michael Maes and Annik Olbrechts and Quentin Python and Derek Strom and Stefaan Tavernier and Walter Van Doninck and Petra Van Mulders and Gerrit Patrick Van Onsem and Ilaria Villella and Cécile Caillol and Barbara Clerbaux and Gilles De Lentdecker and Didar Dobur and Laurent Favart and APR Gay and Anastasia Grebenyuk and Alexandre Léonard and Abdollah Mohammadi and Luca Perniè and Thomas Reis and Tomislav Seva and Laurent Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and Volker Adler and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and Silvia Costantini and S Crucy and Sven Dildick and Alexis Fagot and Guillaume Garcia and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Dirk Ryckbosch and S Salva Diblen and Michael Sigamani and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and G Bruno and R Castello and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and T du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and P Jez and M Komm and V Lemaitre and C Nuttens and D Pagano and L Perrini and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and JM Vizan Garcia and N Beliy and T Caebergs and E Daubie and GH Hammad and WL Aldá Júnior and GA Alves and L Brito and M Correa Martins Junior and T Dos Reis Martins and ME Pol and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custodio and EM Da Costa and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and H Malbouisson and D Matos Figueiredo and L Mundim and H Nogima and WL Prado Da Silva and J Santaolalla and A Santoro,351,17187236169083770696,Physics Letters B,,64-85,North-Holland,Constraints on the Higgs boson width from off-shell production and decay to Z-boson pairs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269314004821,736,2014,/scholar?cites=17187236169083770696,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:yL7DKRohVA8C

The data, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1.0 pb− 1 (5 TeV), 6.2 pb− 1 (7 TeV), and 0.7 pb− 1 (13 TeV), were collected using the CMS detector at the LHC.

The elliptic anisotropy parameter defined as the second coefficient in a Fourier expansion of the particle invariant yields, is extracted using the event-plane method, two-and four-particle cumulants, and Lee--Yang zeros. The anisotropy is presented as a function of transverse momentum (pt), pseudorapidity (eta) over a broad kinematic range: 0.3< pt< 20 GeV, abs (eta)< 2.4, and in 12 classes of collision centrality from 0 to 80%.

The numbers of observed events are found to be consistent with the expected numbers from standard model processes, and limits are placed on new-physics scenarios that yield multilepton final states …",Serguei Chatrchyan and V Khachatryan and AM Sirunyan and A Tumasyan and W Adam and T Bergauer and M Dragicevic and J Erö and C Fabjan and M Friedl and R Frühwirth and VM Ghete and C Hartl and N Hörmann and J Hrubec and M Jeitler and W Kiesenhofer and V Knünz and M Krammer and I Krätschmer and D Liko and I Mikulec and D Rabady and B Rahbaran and H Rohringer and R Schöfbeck and J Strauss and A Taurok and W Treberer-Treberspurg and W Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and V Mossolov and N Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and S Alderweireldt and M Bansal and S Bansal and Tom Cornelis and EA De Wolf and X Janssen and A Knutsson and S Luyckx and S Ochesanu and B Roland and R Rougny and H Van Haevermaet and P Van Mechelen and A Van Spilbeeck and F Blekman and S Blyweert and J D’Hondt and N Heracleous and A Kalogeropoulos and J Keaveney and Tae Jeong Kim and S Lowette and M Maes and A Olbrechts and D Strom and S Tavernier and W Van Doninck and P Van Mulders and GP Van Onsem and I Villella and C Caillol and B Clerbaux and G De Lentdecker and L Favart and APR Gay and A Léonard and PE Marage and A Mohammadi and L Perniè and T Reis and T Seva and Thomas,224,7771336598200318094,Physical Review D,3,032006,American Physical Society,Search for anomalous production of events with three or more leptons in p p collisions at s= 8 TeV,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.90.032006,90,2014,/scholar?cites=7771336598200318094,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:z6xuaG2dYH0C

7225,"Commissioning studies of the CMS hadron calorimeter have identified sporadic uncharacteristic noise and a small number of malfunctioning calorimeter channels. Algorithms have been developed to identify and address these problems in the data. The methods have been tested on cosmic ray muon data, calorimeter noise data, and single beam data collected with CMS in 2008. The noise rejection algorithms can be applied to LHC collision data at the trigger level or in the offline analysis. The application of the algorithms at the trigger level is shown to remove 90% of noise events with fake missing transverse energy above 100 GeV, which is sufficient for the CMS physics trigger operation.",CMS collaboration,223,388227275593530295,Journal of Instrumentation,03,T03014,IOP Publishing,Identification and filtering of uncharacteristic noise in the CMS hadron calorimeter,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/5/03/T03014/meta,5,2010,/scholar?cites=388227275593530295,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:C-GuzCveMkwC

7227,"The Large Hadron Collider at CERN has begun operations at 7 TeV center of mass energy. CERN plans to run at this energy until the end of 2012 with the goal of providing an integrated luminosity of a few fb $^{-1} $ to the CMS and ATLAS experiments. The LHC will then shut down for 1.5 to 2 years to make the revisions necessary to run at $ sim $14 TeV. Operation resumes in 2014. In 2017/18, there will be another long shutdown to prepare the LHC to operate at and eventually above the design luminosity of 10$^ ext {34} $ percms. Operation will then resume with the luminosity rising gradually during this period to 2$ imes $10$^ ext {34} $ percms. The two long shutdowns provide CMS an opportunity to carry out improvements to make the experiment more efficient, to repair problems that have been uncovered during early operations, and to upgrade the detector to cope with the ultimate luminosity that will be achieved during this period. The detector work involves the hadron calorimeters, the muon detectors, the pixel detector, the beam radiation monitoring and luminosity measurement system, the trigger, the data acquistion system, and the CMS infrastructure and facilities.

7264,"A search for microscopic black hole production and decay in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV has been conducted by the CMS Collaboration at the LHC, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 pb−1. Events with large total transverse energy are analyzed for the presence of multiple high-energy jets, leptons, and photons, typical of a signal expected from a microscopic black hole.

The interpretation of the search results focuses on spin-0 and spin-2 resonances with masses between 0.5 and 4 TeV and with widths, relative to the mass, between 1.4× 10− 4 and 5.6× 10− 2.

7274,"A systematic study of the factorization of long-range azimuthal two-particle correlations into a product of single-particle anisotropies is presented as a function of p T and η of both particles and as a function of the particle multiplicity in PbPb and p Pb collisions. The data were taken with the CMS detector for PbPb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV and p Pb collisions at s NN= 5.02 TeV, covering a very wide range of multiplicity. Factorization is observed to be broken as a function of both particle p T and η. When measured with particles of different p T, the magnitude of the factorization breakdown for the second Fourier harmonic reaches 20% for very central PbPb collisions but decreases rapidly as the multiplicity decreases. The data are consistent with viscous hydrodynamic predictions, which suggest that the effect of factorization breaking is mainly sensitive to the initial-state conditions rather than to the transport properties …",Vardan Khachatryan and Albert M Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and Wolfgang Adam and E Asilar and Thomas Bergauer and Johannes Brandstetter and Marko Dragicevic and Janos Erö and Martin Flechl and Markus Friedl and Rudolf Fruehwirth and Vasile Mihai Ghete and Christian Hartl and Natascha Hörmann and Josef Hrubec and Manfred Jeitler and Wolfgang Kiesenhofer and Valentin Knünz and Axel König and Manfred Krammer and Ilse Krätschmer and Dietrich Liko and Ivan Mikulec and Dinyar Rabady and Babak Rahbaran and Herbert Rohringer and Jochen Schieck and Robert Schöfbeck and Josef Strauss and Wolfgang Treberer-Treberspurg and Wolfgang Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and Vladimir Mossolov and Nikolai Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and Sara Alderweireldt and Sunil Bansal and Tom Cornelis and Eddi A De Wolf and Xavier Janssen and Albert Knutsson and Jasper Lauwers and Sten Luyckx and Silvia Ochesanu and Romain Rougny and Merijn Van De Klundert and Hans Van Haevermaet and Pierre Van Mechelen and Nick Van Remortel and Alex Van Spilbeeck and S Abu Zeid and Freya Blekman and Jorgen D'Hondt and Nadir Daci and Isabelle De Bruyn and Kevin Deroover and Natalie Heracleous and James Keaveney and Steven Lowette and Lieselotte Moreels and Annik Olbrechts and Quentin Python and Derek Strom and Stefaan Tavernier and Walter Van Doninck and Petra Van Mulders and Gerrit Patrick Van Onsem and Isis Van Parijs and Cécile Caillol and Barbara Clerbaux and Gilles De Lentdecker and Hugo Delannoy and Didar Dobur and Giuseppe Fasanella and Laurent Favart and APR Gay and Anastasia Grebenyuk and Alexandre Léonard and Abdollah Mohammadi and Luca Perniè and Aidan Randle-conde and Thomas Reis and Tomislav Seva and Laurent Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and F Zenoni and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and S Crucy and Alexis Fagot and Guillaume Garcia and Muhammad Gul and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and D Poyraz and Dirk Ryckbosch and S Salva Diblen and Michael Sigamani and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and Ward Van Driessche and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and G Bruno and R Castello and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and T Du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and A Jafari and P Jez and M Komm and V Lemaitre and A Mertens and C Nuttens and L Perrini and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and N Beliy and T Caebergs and GH Hammad and WL Aldá Júnior and GA Alves and L Brito and M Correa Martins Junior and T Dos Reis Martins and C Hensel and C Mora Herrera and A Moraes and ME Pol and P Rebello Teles and E Belchior Batista Das Chagas and W Carvalho and J Chinellato,190,2855035246767711792,Physical Review C,3,034911,American Physical Society,Evidence for transverse-momentum- and pseudorapidity-dependent event-plane fluctuations in PbPb and  collisions,https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.92.034911,92,2015,/scholar?cites=2855035246767711792,q_wYjF8AAAAJ:W5xh706n7nkC

This study uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns, collected using the CMS detector in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV at the LHC. Events containing a single electron or muon and missing transverse momentum are analyzed. No significant excess of events above the standard model expectation is found in the transverse mass distribution of the lepton-neutrino system, and upper limits for cross sections above different transverse mass thresholds are presented. Mass exclusion limits at 95% CL for a range of W'models are determined, including a limit of 2.5 TeV for right-handed W'bosons with standard-model-like couplings and limits of 2.43--2.63 TeV for left-handed W'bosons, taking into account their interference with the standard model W boson.

7297,"Results are reported from a search for supersymmetry in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, based on events with a single isolated lepton (electron or muon) and multiple jets, at least two of which are identified as b jets. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb− 1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The search is motivated by supersymmetric models that involve strong-production processes and cascade decays of new particles.

Fragmentation functions are constructed using charged-particle tracks with transverse momenta p T> 4 GeV/c for dijet events with a leading jet of p T> 100 GeV/c. The fragmentation functions in PbPb events are compared to those in pp data as a function of collision centrality, as well as dijet-p T imbalance. Special emphasis is placed on the most central PbPb events including dijets with unbalanced momentum, indicative of energy loss of the hard scattered parent partons.

7347,"The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force—the W+, W–, and Z0 bosons—as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector.

Data from LHC proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns, have been collected with the CMS detector. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT clustering algorithm with a size parameter of 0.7 in a phase space region covering jet pT from 74 GeV up to 2.5 TeV and jet absolute rapidity up to abs (y)= 3.0. The low-pT jet range between 21 and 74 GeV is also studied up to abs (y)= 4.7, using a dedicated data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.6 inverse picobarns. The measured jet cross section is corrected for detector effects and compared with the predictions from perturbative QCD at next-to-leading order (NLO) using various sets of parton distribution functions (PDF).

Upsilons that decay into muons are reconstructed within the rapidity interval abs (y [CM])< 1.93 in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass frame.

Fragmentation functions are constructed using charged-particle tracks with transverse momenta pt> 4 GeV for dijet events with a leading jet of pt> 100 GeV. The fragmentation functions in PbPb events are compared to those in pp data as a function of collision centrality, as well as dijet-pt imbalance. Special emphasis is placed on the most central PbPb events including dijets with unbalanced momentum, indicative of energy loss of the hard scattered parent partons. The fragmentation patterns for both the leading and subleading jets in PbPb collisions agree with those seen in pp data at 2.76 TeV.

Limits are determined on the production of scalar top quarks (top squarks) in the framework of R-parity violating supersymmetry and on the production of color-octet vector bosons (colorons). First limits at the LHC are placed on top squark production for two scenarios. The first assumes decay to a bottom quark and a light-flavor quark and is excluded for masses between 200 and 385 GeV, and the second assumes decay to a pair of light-flavor quarks and is excluded for masses between 200 and 350 GeV at 95% confidence level.

7480,"This report describes the technical design and outlines the expected performance of the Phase 1 Upgrade of the CMS Hadron Calorimeters. The upgrade is designed to improve the performance of the calorimeters at high luminosity with large numbers of pileup events by increasing the depth-segmentation of the calorimeter and providing new capabilities for anomalous background rejection. The photodetectors of the CMS Barrel and Endcap Hadron Calorimeters, currently hybrid photodiodes (HPDs), will be replaced by silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) devices. The single-channel phototubes of the Forward Hadron Calorimeter will be replaced by multi-anode phototubes operated in a dual-anode configuration. The readout electronics for all three calorimeter systems will also be replaced. A new charge-integrating ADC, the QIE10, with an integrated TDC will be used along with a 4.8 Gbps data-link. The off-detector electronics will also be substantially upgraded to handle higher data volumes and improve the information sent to the calorimeter trigger system. The expected performance of these upgrades is discussed, including a detailed study of several Higgs and SUSY analyses.

This implies that the mean energy per particle is increasing with collision energy. At all pseudorapidities, the transverse energy per participating nucleon increases with the centrality of the collision. The ratio of transverse energy per unit pseudorapidity in peripheral to central collisions varies significantly as the pseudorapidity increases from η= 0 to| η|= 5.0.

7521,"Azimuthal dihadron correlations of charged particles have been measured in PbPb collisions at= 2.76 TeV by the CMS collaboration, using data from the 2011 LHC heavy-ion run. The data set includes a sample of ultra-central (0-0.2% centrality) PbPb events collected using a trigger based on total transverse energy in the hadron forward calorimeters and the total multiplicity of pixel clusters in the silicon pixel tracker. A total of about 1.8 million ultra-central events were recorded, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 120 μb− 1. The observed correlations in ultra-central PbPb events are expected to be particularly sensitive to initial-state fluctuations.

7530,"A search is presented for narrow heavy resonances X decaying into pairs of Higgs bosons () in proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at . The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7. The search considers  resonances with masses between 1 and 3, having final states of two b quark pairs. Each Higgs boson is produced with large momentum, and the hadronization products of the pair of b quarks can usually be reconstructed as single large jets.

The analysis is conducted with a data sample corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 5 inverse femtobarns, collected by the CMS detector at the LHC.

7564,"A search is presented for an excess of events with large missing transverse momentum in association with at least one highly energetic jet, in a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The results are interpreted using a set of simplified models for the production of dark matter via a scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, or axial vector mediator. Additional sensitivity is achieved by tagging events consistent with the jets originating from a hadronically decaying vector boson. This search uses jet substructure techniques to identify hadronically decaying vector bosons in both Lorentz-boosted and resolved scenarios. This analysis yields improvements of 80% in terms of excluded signal cross sections with respect to the previous CMS analysis using the same data set. No significant excess with respect to the standard model expectation is observed and limits are placed on the parameter space of the simplified models.

The precise alignment of this complex device is a formidable challenge, and only achievable with a significant extension of the technologies routinely used for tracking detectors in the past. This article describes the full-scale alignment procedure as it is used during LHC operations. Among the specific features of the method are the simultaneous determination of up to 200 000 alignment parameters with tracks, the measurement of individual sensor curvature parameters, the control of systematic misalignment effects, and the implementation of the whole procedure in a multi-processor environment for high execution speed.

7590,"A search for dark matter is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying either to a pair of bottom quarks or to a pair of photons. The data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Results are interpreted in the context of a Z'-two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge symmetry of the standard model is extended to a U (1)[Z'] group, with a new massive Z'gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z'decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m [Z']-m [A] phase space. For example, the observed data exclude the Z'mass range from 600 to 1860 GeV, for Z'coupling strength g [Z']= 0.8, the coupling of A with dark matter particles g [chi]= 1, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values tan [beta]= 1, and m [A]= 300 GeV.

7608,"This Letter describes the search for an enhanced production rate of events with a charged lepton and a neutrino in high-energy p p collisions at the LHC. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector, with an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb− 1 at s= 7 TeV, and a further 3.7 fb− 1 at s= 8 TeV. No evidence is found for an excess. The results are interpreted in terms of limits on a heavy charged gauge boson (W′) in the sequential standard model, a split universal extra dimension model, and contact interactions in the helicity-nonconserving model.

7617,"A search is performed for heavy Majorana neutrinos (N) decaying into a W boson and a lepton using the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A signature of two jets and either two same sign electrons or a same sign electron-muon pair is searched for using 19.7 fb− 1 of data collected during 2012 in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data are found to be consistent with the expected standard model (SM) background and, in the context of a Type-1 seesaw mechanism, upper limits are set on the cross section times branching fraction for production of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the mass range between 40 and 500 GeV. The results are additionally interpreted as limits on the mixing between the heavy Majorana neutrinos and the SM neutrinos.

7618,"A search has been performed for long-lived particles that could have come to rest within the CMS detector, using the time intervals between LHC beam crossings. The existence of such particles could be deduced from observation of their decays via energy deposits in the CMS calorimeter appearing at times that are well separated from any proton–proton collisions. Using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.6 of 8 proton–proton collisions, and a search interval corresponding to 281 h of trigger livetime, 10 events are observed, with a background prediction of  events. Limits are presented at 95 % confidence level on gluino and top squark production, for over 13 orders of magnitude in the mean proper lifetime of the stopped particle.

7619,"The Fourier coefficients v 2 and v 3 characterizing the anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution of charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at s NN= 5.02 TeV are measured with data collected by the CMS experiment. The measurements cover a broad transverse momentum range, 1< p T< 100 GeV/c. The analysis focuses on the p T> 10 GeV/c range, where anisotropic azimuthal distributions should reflect the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the created medium. Results are presented in several bins of PbPb collision centrality, spanning the 60% most central events. The v 2 coefficient is measured with the scalar product and the multiparticle cumulant methods, which have different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. The values from both methods remain positive up to p T∼ 60–80 GeV/c, in all examined centrality classes.
