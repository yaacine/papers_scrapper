18038,"Molecular interaction Information is a key resource in modern biomedical research. Publicly available data have previously been provided in a broad array of diverse formats, making access to this very difficult. The publication and wide implementation of the Human Proteome Organisation Proteomics Standards Initiative Molecular Interactions (HUPO PSI-MI) format in 2004 was a major step towards the establishment of a single, unified format by which molecular interactions should be presented, but focused purely on protein-protein interactions. The HUPO-PSI has further developed the PSI-MI XML schema to enable the description of interactions between a wider range of molecular types, for example nucleic acids, chemical entities, and molecular complexes. Extensive details about each supported molecular interaction can now be captured, including the biological role of each molecule within that interaction, detailed description of interacting domains, and the kinetic parameters of the interaction. The format is supported by data management and analysis tools and has been adopted by major interaction data providers. Additionally, a simpler, tab-delimited format MITAB2.5 has been developed for the benefit of users who require only minimal information in an easy to access configuration. The PSI-MI XML2.5 and MITAB2.5 formats have been jointly developed by interaction data producers and providers from both the academic and commercial sector, and are already widely implemented and well supported by an active development community.

18056,"Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage.

18096,"Protein sequence databases are the pillar upon which modern proteomics is supported, representing a stable reference space of predicted and validated proteins. One example of such resources is UniProt, enriched with both expertly curated and automatic annotations. Taken largely for granted, similar mature resources such as UniProt are not available yet in some other “omics” fields, lipidomics being one of them. While having a seasoned community of wet lab scientists, lipidomics lies significantly behind proteomics in the adoption of data standards and other core bioinformatics concepts. This work aims to reduce the gap by developing an equivalent resource to UniProt called ‘LipidHome’, providing theoretically generated lipid molecules and useful metadata. Using the ‘FASTLipid’ Java library, a database was populated with theoretical lipids, generated from a set of community agreed upon chemical bounds. In parallel, a web application was developed to present the information and provide computational access via a web service. Designed specifically to accommodate high throughput mass spectrometry based approaches, lipids are organised into a hierarchy that reflects the variety in the structural resolution of lipid identifications. Additionally, cross-references to other lipid related resources and papers that cite specific lipids were used to annotate lipid records. The web application encompasses a browser for viewing lipid records and a ‘tools’ section where an MS1 search engine is currently implemented.

18126,"In the absence of consolidated pipelines to archive biological data electronically, information dispersed in the literature must be captured by manual annotation. Unfortunately, manual annotation is time consuming and the coverage of published interaction data is therefore far from complete. The use of text-mining tools to identify relevant publications and to assist in the initial information extraction could help to improve the efficiency of the curation process and, as a consequence, the database coverage of data available in the literature. The 2006 BioCreative competition was aimed at evaluating text-mining procedures in comparison with manual annotation of protein-protein interactions. To aid the BioCreative protein-protein interaction task, IntAct and MINT (Molecular INTeraction) provided both the training and the test datasets. Data from both databases are comparable because they were curated according to the same standards. During the manual curation process, the major cause of data loss in mining the articles for information was ambiguity in the mapping of the gene names to stable UniProtKB database identifiers. It was also observed that most of the information about interactions was contained only within the full-text of the publication; hence, text mining of protein-protein interaction data will require the analysis of the full-text of the articles and cannot be restricted to the abstract.

MIBBI is an umbrella organization uniting communities developing Minimum Information (MI) checklists to standardize the description of data sets, the workflows by which they were generated and the scientific context for the work. This workshop brought together representatives of more than twenty communities to present the status of their MI checklists and plans for future development. Shared challenges and solutions were identified and the role of MIBBI in MI checklist development was discussed. The meeting featured some thirty presentations, wide-ranging discussions and breakout groups. The top outcomes of the two-day workshop as defined by the participants were: 1) the chance to share best practices and to identify areas of synergy; 2) defining a series of tasks for updating the MIBBI Portal; 3) reemphasizing the need to maintain independent MI checklists for various communities while leveraging common terms and workflow elements contained in multiple checklists; and 4) revision of the concept of the MIBBI Foundry to focus on the creation of a core set of MIBBI modules intended for reuse by individual MI checklist projects while maintaining the integrity of each MI project.

18158," Motivation: In any macromolecular polyprotic system—for example protein, DNA or RNA—the isoelectric point—commonly referred to as the pI—can be defined as the point of singularity in a titration curve, corresponding to the solution pH value at which the net overall surface charge—and thus the electrophoretic mobility—of the ampholyte sums to zero. Different modern analytical biochemistry and proteomics methods depend on the isoelectric point as a principal feature for protein and peptide characterization.

The number of groups that are working on this topic is constantly increasing. However, the field is still very heterogeneous in terms of applied instrumentation and data processing methods. In addition, complex datasets are reduced to a set of two-dimensional “images,” which inevitably results in information loss. This simplified graphical representation also strongly depends on processing options such as color scale, intensity normalization, and spatial interpolation. Consequently, experimental data are presented in very diverse ways, and published results can therefore be difficult to evaluate and compare.

To map the submitted protein identifier to a currently active entry, two distinct approaches were used. The first approach used the Protein Identifier Cross Referencing (PICR) service at the EBI, which maps protein identifiers based on 100% sequence identity. The second one (called logical mapping algorithm) accessed the source databases and retrieved the current status of the reported identifier.Our analysis showed the differences between the main protein databases (International Protein Index (IPI), UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), National Center for Biotechnological Information nr database (NCBI nr), and Ensembl) in respect to identifier stability. For example, whereas 20% of submitted IPI entries were deleted after two years, virtually all UniProtKB entries remained either active or replaced. Furthermore, the two mapping algorithms produced markedly different results. For example, the PICR service reported 10% more IPI entries deleted compared with the logical mapping algorithm.

Several experiments can be visualized in succession, to determine whether expression changes with experimental conditions, a useful feature for examining a time‐course, dose‐response, or disease progression. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Steve Jupe and Antonio Fabregat and Henning Hermjakob,13,1724404164423872015,Current protocols in bioinformatics,1,8.20. 1-8.20. 9,,Expression data analysis with Reactome,https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/0471250953.bi0820s49,49,2015,/scholar?cites=1724404164423872015,K_2RH6oAAAAJ:V2uI0bKpj5cC
18202,"The PRIDE database, developed and maintained at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), is one of the most prominent data repositories dedicated to high throughput MS‐based proteomics data. Peptidome, developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as a sibling resource to PRIDE, was discontinued due to funding constraints in April 2011. A joint effort between the two teams was started soon after the Peptidome closure to ensure that data were not “lost” to the wider proteomics community by exporting it to PRIDE. As a result, data in the low terabyte range have been migrated from Peptidome to PRIDE and made publicly available under experiment accessions 17 900–18 271, representing 54 projects, ∼53 million mass spectra, ∼10 million peptide identifications, ∼650 000 protein identifications, ∼1.1 million biologically relevant protein modifications, and 28 species, from more …",Attila Csordas and Rui Wang and Daniel Ríos and Florian Reisinger and Joseph M Foster and Douglas J Slotta and Juan Antonio Vizcaíno and Henning Hermjakob,12,18300247356344538339,Proteomics,10-11,1692-1695,,From Peptidome to PRIDE: P ublic proteomics data migration at a large scale,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pmic.201200514,13,2013,/scholar?cites=18300247356344538339,K_2RH6oAAAAJ:epqYDVWIO7EC
