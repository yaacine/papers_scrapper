23000,"Stuart Kauffman here presents a brilliant new paradigm for evolutionary biology, one that extends the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution to accommodate recent findings and perspectives from the fields of biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics. The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve. The work is written for all those …",Stuart A Kauffman,16485,4837325360453710338,,,,"Oxford University Press, USA",The origins of order: Self-organization and selection in evolution,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lZcSpRJz0dgC&oi=fnd&pg=PR13&dq=info:AvLUPMmhIUMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=9-AQd-6MOt&sig=Oe0uDqrfevBil93Gz74YnELesGM,,1993,/scholar?cites=4837325360453710338,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:AXPGKjj_ei8C
23001,"A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivals Darwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in the Universe, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science--and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos. We all know of instances of spontaneous order in nature--an oil droplet in water forms a sphere, snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering, Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous order arise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization, or what he calls"" order for free,"" that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity--a living cell. Kauffman uses the analogy of a thousand buttons on a rug--join two buttons randomly with thread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs; later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, a remarkable transformation occurs--much like the phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice--and the buttons link …",Stuart Kauffman,8592,15342322322248561409,,,,Oxford university press,At home in the universe: The search for the laws of self-organization and complexity,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=AQFpAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:AfMrb93g6tQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=Ynjp9go8m_&sig=wDONCazQiD4LSB7AX3rjdLQr2z0,,1996,/scholar?cites=15342322322248561409,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:9vf0nzSNQJEC
23002,"Proto-organisms probably were randomly aggregated nets of chemical reactions. The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly constructed nets of these binary “genes”. The results suggest that, if each “gene” is directly affected by two or three other “genes”, then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior.

23003,""" It may be that I have stumbled upon an adequate description of life itself."" These modest yet profound words trumpet an imminent paradigm shift in scientific, economic, and technological thinking. In the tradition of Schrödinger's classic What Is Life?, Kauffman's Investigations is a tour-de-force exploration of the very essence of life itself, with conclusions that radically undermine the scientific approaches on which modern science rests--the approaches of Newton, Boltzman, Bohr, and Einstein. Building on his pivotal ideas about order and evolution in complex life systems, Kauffman finds that classical science does not take into account that physical systems--such as people in a biosphere--effect their dynamic environments in addition to being affected by them. These systems act on their own behalf as autonomous agents, but what defines them as such? In other words, what is life? Kauffman supplies a novel answer that goes beyond traditional scientific thinking by defining and explaining autonomous agents and work in the contexts of thermodynamics and of information theory. Much of Investigations unpacks the progressively surprising implications of his definition. Significantly, he sets the stages for a technological revolution in the coming decades. Scientists and engineers may soon seek to create autonomous agents--both organic and mechanical--that can not only construct things and work, but also reproduce themselves! Kauffman also lays out a foundation for a new concept of organization, and explores the requirements for the emergence of a general biology that will transcend terrestrial biology to seek laws governing biospheres …",Stuart A Kauffman,2370,9349389292112819122,,,,Oxford University Press,Investigations,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=HLkX-6m4W8kC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=info:srM5pwa0v4EJ:scholar.google.com&ots=iiZyu0eF9j&sig=6uv5w87OKp29rLKcvuxjcT-jNvk,,2000,/scholar?cites=9349389292112819122,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C
23004,"Developmental constraints (defined as biases on the production of variant phenotypes or limitations on phenotypic variability caused by the structure, character, composition, or dynamics of the developmental system) undoubtedly play a significant role in evolution. Yet there is little agreement on their importance as compared with selection, drift, and other such factors in shaping evolutionary history. This review distinguishes between ""universal"" and ""local"" constraints; it deals primarily with the latter, which apply to a limited range of taxa. Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints.

23005,"Francois Jacob, in his 1977 essay,"" Evolution and tinkering"", eloquently explicated the ways in which adaptation is constrained by past history and by the nature of the evolutionary process itself: adaptation generally progresses through small changes involving a local search procedure in the space of possible genetic rearrangements. To understand the evolutionary process, we therefore must understand the constraints that such a local search procedure places on any optimization scheme. Moreover, by comparing local to more global search algorithms, we can gain some insight into how the nature of evolutionary change depends upon the genetic distances that can exist between parents and offspring. If, for example, the rate of mutation is increased, so that parents and offspring may differ at a larger number of loci, one result may be the appearance of qualitatively different patterns of evolution at the population level.The simplest paradigm of evolutionary change is one of local"" hill climbing"". Despite this transparent and simplistic metaphor, such evolutionary hill climbing involves a complex combinatorial optimization process. In such optimization processes, typically, many parts and processes must become coordinated to achieve some measure of overall success, but conflicting requirements due to alternative simultaneous optimization goals, or conflicting constraints due to the natures of the different parts and processes to be coordinated, limit the end result achieved. Our aim in this article is to explore some initial steps in the formulation of a general theory of such constrained adaptive"" walks"", which must proceed along a path of"" fitter variants …",Stuart Kauffman and Simon Levin,1426,8937149518297445880,Journal of theoretical Biology,1,11-45,Academic Press,Towards a general theory of adaptive walks on rugged landscapes,https://www.icts.res.in/sites/default/files/PGE2018-Joachim-Krug-Reading-Material-Lecture-3.pdf,128,1987,/scholar?cites=8937149518297445880,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC
23006,"A brilliant book celebrating improbability as the engine that drives life, by the acclaimed author of The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker. The human eye is so complex and works so precisely that surely, one might believe, its current shape and function must be the product of design. How could such an intricate object have come about by chance? Tackling this subject--in writing that the New York Times called"" a masterpiece""--Richard Dawkins builds a carefully reasoned and lovingly illustrated argument for evolutionary adaptation as the mechanism for life on earth. The metaphor of Mount Improbable represents the combination of perfection and improbability that is epitomized in the seemingly"" designed"" complexity of living things. Dawkins skillfully guides the reader on a breathtaking journey through the mountain's passes and up its many peaks to demonstrate that following the improbable path to perfection takes time. Evocative illustrations accompany Dawkins's eloquent descriptions of extraordinary adaptations such as the teeming populations of figs, the intricate silken world of spiders, and the evolution of wings on the bodies of flightless animals.

In these models the fitness contribution of each of Ngenes in a genotype depends epistatically on Kother genes. Increasing epistatic interactions increases the rugged multipeaked character of the fitness landscape. Coevolution is thought of, at the lowest level, as a coupling of landscapes such that adaptive moves by one player deform the landscapes of its immediate partners. In these models we are able to tune the ruggedness of landscapes, how richly intercoupled any two landscapes are, and how many other players interact with each player.

Ensemble specifications have been based on: 1) choice of Boolean function regulating each node in the automaton; 2) random or biased mappings of the 2N automata states into themselves; 3) the numbers of inputs, K, per node. This article briefly reviews these approaches, reports new results on the expected behavior of threshold automata, and automata with a particular class of biased mappings. In addition, it discusses emergent, highly ordered dynamical behavior in random automata rich in a specific class of “canalizing” Boolean functions due to the crystallization of powerful subautomata called forcing structures.

Next, host cells containing the vectors are cultured so as to produce peptides, polypeptides, or proteins encoded by the stochastically generated polynucleotide sequences.

While it is unclear exactly what is meant by the claim that there can be no logic of search, it is clear that this opinion, coupled with anecdotes of Poincaré’s sudden solution of a mathematical problem while stepping on a Madrid streetcar, and Kekulé’s vision of a snake biting its tail, have left the aura that the generation of an hypothesis is as mysterious as a Gestalt shift in perception of a figure.

23041,"The coordinated expression of the different genes in an organism is essential to sustain functionality under the random external perturbations to which the organism might be subjected. To cope with such external variability, the global dynamics of the genetic network must possess two central properties. (a) It must be robust enough as to guarantee stability under a broad range of external conditions, and (b) it must be flexible enough to recognize and integrate specific external signals that may help the organism to change and adapt to different environments. This compromise between robustness and adaptability has been observed in dynamical systems operating at the brink of a phase transition between order and chaos. Such systems are termed critical. Thus, criticality, a precise, measurable, and well characterized property of dynamical systems, makes it possible for robustness and adaptability to coexist in living organisms. In this work we investigate the dynamical properties of the gene transcription networks reported for S. cerevisiae, E. coli, and B. subtilis, as well as the network of segment polarity genes of D. melanogaster, and the network of flower development of A. thaliana.

As evidenced by the title's mention of creativity, the book refreshingly argues that our preoccupation to explain all things with scientific law has deadened our creative natures.

The stochastic kinetics of this model is investigated, and it is found that the delays for the protein productions can highly weaken the global fluctuations for the expressions of the two genes, making the two mutually repressive genes coexist for a long time. Starting from this model, we propose a practical modeling strategy for more complex gene regulatory networks. Unlike previous applications of the Gillespie algorithm to simulate specific genetic networks dynamics, this modeling strategy is proposed for an ensemble approach to study the dynamical properties of these networks.

Even a non-economist, regarding a hunter-gatherer society, or the economy which graced an early agricultural society in Mesopotamia or the American West, and comparing it to the economy of a modern continental nation such as the United States, is struck by the enormous increase in the diversity of means of earning a living which our present economy affords. Mathematical economics, it must be admitted, is a refined way of catching dinner. The coupled web of economic activities, the production and sale of goods and services, has obviously increased in complexity over time. Yet apparently we have no well-developed body of theory for this historical process, even in the presence of the work of economic historians, and the large field of developmental economics. Whether it is fair for an outsider to suppose that no adequate theoretical picture is available is not for me to say. But if it exists, then at least it is not well known to the new economic friends who gathered in Santa Fe. The “basic image” I wish to discuss is this: an economy is a web of transformations of products and services among economic agents.

Understanding the mechanisms that determine which genes are expressed, and when they are expressed, is one of the keys to genetic manipulation for many purposes, including the development of new treatments for disease.  Viewing each gene in a genome as a distinct variable that is either on (expresses) or off (does not express), or more realistically as a continuous variable (the rate of expression), the values of some of these variables influence the values of others through the regulatory proteins they express, including, of course, the possibility that the rate of expression of a gene at one time may, in various circumstances, influence the rate of expression of that same gene at a later time. If we imagine an arrow drawn from each gene expression variable at a given time to a gene variable whose expression it influences a short while after, the result is a network, technically a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, the DAG in Figure 1 is a representation of a system in which the expression level of gene G1 at time 1 (denoted as G1(1)) causes the expression level of G2(2), which in turn causes the expression level of G3(3). The arrows in Figure 1 which do not have a variable at their tails are “error terms” which represent all of the causes of a variable other than the ones explicitly represented in the DAG.

Our results are applicable to the classical case of self-replicating …",Peter R Wills and Stuart A Kauffman and Barbel MR Stadler and Peter F Stadler,61,10532407170336325860,Bulletin of Mathematical Biology,6,1073-1098,No longer published by Elsevier,Selection dynamics in autocatalytic systems: Templates replicating through binary ligation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092824098900039,60,1998,/scholar?cites=10532407170336325860,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:NaGl4SEjCO4C
23101,"The increasingly evident limitations of target-selective cancer therapy has stimulated a flurry of ideas for overcoming the development of resistance and recurrence – the near universal reason for therapy failure from which target-selective drugs are not exempt. A widely proposed approach to conquer therapy resistance is to depart from the myopic focus on individual causal pathways and instead target multiple nodes in the cancer cell's gene regulatory network. However, most ideas rely on a simplistic conceptualization of networks: utilizing solely their topology and treating it as a display of causal interactions, while ignoring the integrated dynamics in state space. Here, we review the more encompassing formal framework of global network dynamics in which cancer cells, like normal cell types, are high-dimensional attractor states. Then therapy is represented by the network perturbation that will promote the exit from …",Sui Huang and Stuart Kauffman,60,2607993364688138453,,4,270-278,Academic Press,How to escape the cancer attractor: rationale and limitations of multi-target drugs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X13000540,23,2013,/scholar?cites=2607993364688138453,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC
23102,"Three plausible hypotheses about developmental commitments in the Drosophila embryo propose that: (1) a micromosaic of localized determinants in the egg trigger somatic commitments; (2) monotonic anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral gradients in the egg specify positions by a series of threshold values; (3) sequential subdivision of the early embryo into ‘anterior’ or ‘posterior’ ‘middle’ or ‘end’, ‘dorsal’ or ‘ventral’, ‘odd’ or ‘even’ compartmental domains encodes the somatic commitment in each region in a combinatorial epigenetic code. Evidence in favour of such a combinatorial code includes its capacity to account for major features of transdetermination and for many single and coordinated homoeotic transformations. In particular, both these metaplasias often cause transformations between ectodermal tissues such as antenna and genitalia, whose anlagen lie far apart on the blastoderm fate map.

23103,"Boolean networks provide a large-scale model of gene regulatory and neuronal networks. In this paper, we study what kinds of Boolean networks best propagate and process signals, i.e. information, in the presence of stochasticity and noise. We first examine two existing approaches that use mutual information and find that these approaches do not capture well the phenomenon studied. We propose a new measure for information propagation based on perturbation avalanches in Boolean networks and find that the measure is maximized in dynamically critical networks and in subcritical networks if noise is present.",Pauli Rämö and Stuart Kauffman and Juha Kesseli and Olli Yli-Harja,58,8672308005348796985,Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena,1,100-104,North-Holland,Measures for information propagation in Boolean networks,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278906004829,227,2007,/scholar?cites=8672308005348796985,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC
23104,"A new approach to drug discovery is based on the generation of high diversity libraries of DNA, RNA, peptides or small molecules. Search of such libraries for useful molecules is an optimization problem on high-dimensional molecular fitness landscapes. We utilize a spin-glass-like model, theNKmodel, to analyze search strategies based on pooling, mutation, recombination and selective hill-climbing. Our results suggest that pooling followed by recombination and/or hill-climbing finds better candidate molecules than pooling alone on most molecular landscapes. Our results point to new experiments to assess the structure of molecular fitness landscapes and improve current models.",Stuart A Kauffman and William G Macready,58,6713785160678073289,Journal of theoretical biology,4,427-440,Academic Press,Search strategies for applied molecular evolution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519385700744,173,1995,/scholar?cites=6713785160678073289,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:M3NEmzRMIkIC
23105,"In this chapter, the authors aim to apply Darwin's idea of natural selection to the maturation of the immune response. They introduce recent results concerning the character of adaptive walks via fitter mutants to local optima, where such walks occur in rugged fitness landscapes with many peaks, ridges, and valleys. The authors review some of the major facts concerning clonal selection and the maturation of the immune response, and introduce a simple model of the maturation process. They introduce the concept of an affinity landscape. The authors develop a theoretical framework in which to study the character of adaptive walks that lead to B cells which secrete antibodies of high affinity for the immunizing epitope. They also introduce a new model, somewhat analogous to models of spin glasses, to study the statistical character of adaptive walks on rugged landscapes. The authors discuss injunctions to …",Stuart A Kauffman and Edward D Weinberger and Alan S Perelson,57,3552834881148101483,,,349-382,CRC Press,Maturation of the immune response via adaptive walks on affinity landscapes,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3552834881148101483&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2018,/scholar?cites=3552834881148101483,yoPM0F8AAAAJ:isC4tDSrTZIC
