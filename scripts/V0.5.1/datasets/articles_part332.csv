332000,"We demonstrate the transfer of information encoded as orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of a light beam. The transmitter and receiver units are based on spatial light modulators, which prepare or measure a laser beam in one of eight pure OAM states. We show that the information encoded in this way is resistant to eavesdropping in the sense that any attempt to sample the beam away from its axis will be subject to an angular restriction and a lateral offset, both of which result in inherent uncertainty in the measurement. This gives an experimental insight into the effects of aperturing and misalignment of the beam on the OAM measurement and demonstrates the uncertainty relationship for OAM.",Graham Gibson and Johannes Courtial and Miles J Padgett and Mikhail Vasnetsov and Valeriy Pas’ko and Stephen M Barnett and Sonja Franke-Arnold,2218,16863530553043070809,Optics express,22,5448-5456,Optical Society of America,Free-space information transfer using light beams carrying orbital angular momentum,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?id=81642.,12,2004,/scholar?cites=16863530553043070809,IknEOyAAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC

332002,"The usual mathematical model of the single-mode electromagnetic field is the harmonic oscillator with an infinite-dimensional state space, which unfortunately cannot accommodate the existence of a Hermitian phase operator. Recently we indicated that this difficulty may be circumvented by using an alternative, and physically indistinguishable, mathematical model of the single-mode field involving a finite but arbitrarily large state space, the dimension of which is allowed to tend to infinity after physically measurable results, such as expectation values, are calculated. In this paper we investigate the properties of a Hermitian phase operator which follows directly and uniquely from the form of the phase states in this space and find them to be well behaved. The phase-number commutator is not subject to the difficulties inherent in Dirac’s original commutator, but still preserves the commutator–Poisson-bracket …",DT Pegg and SMf Barnett,1040,17347360138838160157,Physical Review A,4,1665,American Physical Society,Phase properties of the quantized single-mode electromagnetic field,https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.39.1665,39,1989,/scholar?cites=17347360138838160157,IknEOyAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C

332004,"Spin angular momentum of photons and the associated polarization of light has been known for many years. However, it is only over the last decade or so that physically realizable laboratory light beams have been used to study the orbital angular momentum of light. In many respects, orbital and spin angular momentum behave in a similar manner, but they differ significantly in others. In particular, orbital angular momentum offers exciting new possibilities with respect to the optical manipulation of matter and to the study of the entanglement of photons. Bringing together 44 landmark papers, Optical Angular Momentum offers the first comprehensive overview of the subject as it has developed. It chronicles the first decade of this important subject and gives a definitive statement of the current status of all aspects of optical angular momentum.

In particular we compare analytical and numerical results for the OPO with one and two transverse spatial dimensions and in the presence of either plane or spherical cavity mirrors. The far-field structure and the correlation functions of the fluctuating signal field anticipate the onset of a transverse spatial pattern which arises classically even in the presence of Gaussian input beams. Correlation functions also reveal the squeezed nature of the OPO field. Numerical simulations of the Langevin model describe the result of short time measurements and show that close to threshold the near-field signal is a noisy spot pattern evolving on a time scale longer than the inverse decay rate of the resonator.

332087,"In this Letter we show that, in spectral regions where there are no orbital cladding resonances to cause transmission loss, the core mode of a continuously twisted photonic crystal fiber (PCF) exhibits optical activity, and that the magnitude of the associated circular birefringence increases linearly with twist rate and is highly reproducible. In contrast to previous work on twist-induced circular birefringence, PCF has zero linear birefringence and an on-axis core, making the appearance of circular birefringence rather unexpected. A theoretical model based on symmetry properties and perturbation theory is developed and used to show that both spin and orbital angular momentum play a role in this effect. It turns out that the degenerate left-and right-circularly polarized modes of the untwisted PCF are not 100% circularly polarized but carry a small amount of orbital angular momentum caused by the interaction between the …",XM Xi and T Weiss and GKL Wong and Fabio Biancalana and Stephen M Barnett and Miles J Padgett and P St J Russell,76,7591881793523714760,Physical review letters,14,143903,American Physical Society,Optical activity in twisted solid-core photonic crystal fibers,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.143903,110,2013,/scholar?cites=7591881793523714760,IknEOyAAAAAJ:-uzm3Y7AvW0C

We show that the size of this shift is proportional to the OAM of the light and that superpositions of different OAM states give rise to multiple frequency sidebands.

332159,"In thermodynamics, one considers thermal systems and the maximization of entropy subject to the conservation of energy. A consequence is Landauer’s erasure principle, which states that the erasure of one bit of information requires a minimum energy cost equal to kT ln (2), where T is the temperature of a thermal reservoir used in the process and k is Boltzmann’s constant. Jaynes, however, argued that the maximum entropy principle could be applied to any number of conserved quantities, which would suggest that information erasure may have alternative costs. Indeed, we showed recently that by using a reservoir comprising energy degenerate spins and subject to conservation of angular momentum, the cost of information erasure is in terms of angular momentum rather than energy. Here, we extend this analysis and derive the minimum cost of information erasure for systems where different conservation laws operate. We find that, for each conserved quantity, the minimum resource needed to erase one bit of memory is λ-1 ln (2), where λ is related to the average value of the conserved quantity. The costs of erasure depend, fundamentally, on both the nature of the physical memory element and the reservoir with which it is coupled.

In the JCM, the familiar Rabi oscilla-tions in the evolution of the atomic inversion as the atom and field exchange energy are affected by the distribution of photon numbers, which causes a dephasing or'collapse'as the range of possible Rabi frequencies interfere (Cummings 1965, von Foerster 1975, Meystre et al 1975, Knight and Milonni 1980).

The discrete nature of the photon number distribution leads to a further purely quantum mechanical effect as the dephased Rabi oscillations par-tially rephase or'revive'.

Given that perfect power transmission for an arbitrary matrix may not be possible, the method is optimized to reach the theoretical best.

332346,"Multiple-copy state discrimination is a fundamental task in quantum information processing. If there are two, pure, nonorthogonal states then both local and collective schemes are known to reach the Helstrom bound, the maximum probability of successful discrimination allowed by quantum theory. For mixed states, it is known that only collective schemes can perform optimally, so it might be expected that these schemes are more resilient to preparation noise.

It is possible to circumvent the problems of deﬁning a self-adjoint operator for a periodic variable by using trigonometric functions of operators as a basis for the quantum mechanical description. This approach, however, does not allow us to study the properties of the angle operator itself.

Although it is a Grassmann function, the distribution function is equivalent to six c-number functions of the two bosonic variables. Experimental quantities are given as bosonic phase space integrals involving the six functions. A Fokker-Planck equation involving both left and right Grassmann differentiation can be obtained for the distribution function, and is equivalent to six coupled equations for the six c-number functions.The approach used involves choosing the canonical form of the (non-unique) positive P distribution function, where the correspondence rules for bosonic operators are non-standard and hence the Fokker-Planck equation is also unusual. Initial conditions, such as for initially uncorrelated states, are used to determine the initial distribution function. Transformations to new bosonic variables rotating at the cavity frequency enables the six coupled equations for the new c-number functions (also equivalent to the canonical Grassmann distribution function) to be solved analytically, based on an ansatz from a 1980 paper by Stenholm.

332405,"In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen published a dramatic, even shattering paper entitledCan quantummechanical description of reality be considered complete?’. The paper builds on simple, apparently unchallengeable ideas of physical reality to expose an apparent conict between relativity and the idea that quantum mechanics is a complete (even correct) theory. At the time of publication, the new quantum theory was only ten years old, yet it already had a number of dramatic successes including the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and the description of the absorption and emission of light by an atom. Relativity was older, but it too had achieved enviable success in predicting physical phenomena.

Nevertheless, the description of the quantum nature of optical phase has been a longstanding problem. Classically, phase is a useful and easily-understood concept, and it might be expected that the classical phase observable should, according to the usual quantization procedures, correspond to an Hermitian phase operator ϕ. Indeed, the existence of this operator was indeed originally postulated by Dirac,1 but problems associated with finding such an operator have led to the present wide-spread belief that no such operator exists.2 Attempts to construct a phase operator have involved the use of an infinite dimensional state space and a polar decomposition of the annihilation operator.

For example, lattice strain enables control of symmetry in solids through a change in the nuclear positions surrounding a metal centre. Light–matter interactions can also induce strain but providing dynamic symmetry control is restricted to specific materials under intense laser illumination. Here, we show how effective chemical symmetry can be tuned by creating a symmetry-breaking rotational bulk polarisation in the electronic charge distribution surrounding a metal centre, which we term a meta-crystal field. The effect arises from an interface-mediated transfer of optical spin from a chiral light beam to produce an electronic torque that replicates the effect of strain created by high pressures.

332442,"Quantum retrodiction is quantum mechanics based on measurement results. If the state prepared by a preparaton device is not completely certain then the retrodictive state, which is the state measured by a detector, can give information about the state at earlier times. If it is used to calculate a set of retrodictive conditional probabilities, then these must be related to the predictive probabilities by Bayes' Theorem [1]. To date we have derived the master equation for the retrodiction of quantum states in open systems [2]. We have shown that the action of a predictive attenuator on a prepared state is equivalent to the action of a retrodictive amplifier on a measured state [3]. Furthermore we have applied retrodiction to a two-level atom interacting with a mode of the electromagnetic field. If the atom is driven the inversion shows retrodictive Rabi oscillations which decay to the value 1/2 [4]. Here we again study retrodiction with two-level atoms. We show, given a coherent initial field state, an unmeasured final state and a measured state of the two-level atom, that the retrodictive Rabi oscillations undergo collapses and previvals. We also retrodict micromaser field states given a measurement of the atom after te micromaser interacton.

332443,"The bandwidth of any communication system, classical or quantum, is limited by the number of orthogonal states in which the information can be encoded. Quantum key distribution systems available commercially rely on the two-dimensional polarisation state of photons. Quantum computation has also been largely designed on the basis of qubits. However, a photon is endowed with other degrees of freedom, such as orbital angular momentum (OAM). OAM is an attractive basis to be used for quantum information because it is discrete and theoretically infinite-dimensional. This promises a higher information capacity per photon which can lead to more complex quantum computation protocols and more security and robustness for quantum cryptography.

In OPO’s, due to birefringence, walk-off between pump and signal appears. This walk-off is responsible for the existence of a convective regime, in which a transverse pattern arises as a macroscopic manifestation of amplified and spatially structured quantum noise, with magnification factors of several orders of magnitudes. These noise-sustained structures are interesting candidates for the study of quantum correlations at a macroscopic level.

332506,"Quantum cryptography is a method for providing two parties who want to communicate securely with a secret key to be used in established protocols of classical cryptography. For more reviews of this topic see [1–3]. Bennett and Brassard showed that it is possible, at least ideally, to create a secret key, shared by sender and receiver, without both parties sharing any secret beforehand. We refer to this protocol as the BB84 protocol [4]. To achieve this goal, sender and receiver are linked by two channels.The first channel is a public channel. The information distributed on it is available to both parties and to a potential eavesdropper. To demonstrate the principle of quantum cryptography we assume that the signals on this channel can not be changed by third parties. The second channel is a channel with strong quantum features. An eavesdropper can interact with the signal in an effort to extract information about the signals. The signal states are chosen in such a way that there is always, on average, a back reaction onto the signal states. We assume the quantum channel to be noiseless and perfect so that the back reaction of the eavesdropper's activity manifests itself as an induced error rate in the signal transmission. The BB84 protocol uses the polarisation states of single photons as signal states. The signal states are, for example, linear vertical or horizontal polarised photons or right or left circular polarised photons. The sender sends a sequence of single photons with a polarisation chosen randomly from the four given ones.

332510,"Transverse pattern formation is commonplace in nonlinear optics [1] and has been observed in a wide variety of experimental realisations. Recently, optical patterns have been predicted to arise and to lower the threshold of operation in Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPO)[2]. OPO are, however, the most common devices used to generate squeezed light and it is natural to study the interrelation between pattern formation and nonclassical light. In particular it has been shown that close to threshold the maximum squeezing of the vacuum originates along the direction identified by the critical wave-vector corresponding to the roll pattem which forms above threshold [3].",A Gatti and H Wiedemann and LA Lugiato and I Marzoli and GL Oppo and SM Barnett,0,,,,TuG4,Optical Society of America,Quantum fluctuations and optical patterns: a Langevin approach,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=IQEC-1996-TuG4,,1996,,IknEOyAAAAAJ:kvJssbFybhEC
332511,"Quantum cryptography has developed in a short time from a subtle idea in quantum theory into a practical technology [1]. The principle behind quantum cryptography is that, in general, measurement of a quantum system (that is the extraction of information) will lead to a modification of the state and that this change is subsequently detectable. In quantum cryptography, two parties can communicate by the transmission and detection of a stream of low intensity light pulses.",SM Barnett and N Liitkenhaus and SJD Phoenix and PD Townsend and KJ Blow and B Huttner and N Imoto,0,,,,FK1,Optical Society of America,Quantum cryptography and information,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=IQEC-1996-FK1,,1996,,IknEOyAAAAAJ:PZE8UkGerEcC
332512,"Amplification of light is the basis of the laser, and is used in most optical communication systems. The availability in recent years of beams of nonclassical light has led to an examination of the effects of amplification on the specifically quantum properties of light. It is known that, due to the uncertainty principle, amplifiers inevitably introduce noise to a signal [1]. the consequences of this noise for nonclassical light have been discussed previously for both lumped and travelling-wave amplifiers [2, 3, 4, 5].",J Jeffers and SM Barnett and R Loudon and R Matloob and M Artoni,0,,,,TuL29,Optical Society of America,Quantum theory of an amplifying dielectric slab,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=iqec-1996-TuL29,,1996,,IknEOyAAAAAJ:9VeumLvkZSQC
