3000,"We present an extensive molecular‐dynamics simulation for a bead spring model of a melt of linear polymers. The number of monomers N covers the range from N=5 to N=400. Since the entanglement length Ne is found to be approximately 35, our chains cover the crossover from the nonentangled to the entangled regime. The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N<Ne, while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin‐echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the …",Kurt Kremer and Gary S Grest,3234,10164367454711182685,The Journal of Chemical Physics,8,5057-5086,American Institute of Physics,Dynamics of entangled linear polymer melts: A molecular‐dynamics simulation,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.458541,92,1990

It combines typical advantages of lattice Monte Carlo methods with those from the continuous Brownian dynamics algorithm. In addition, it allows for the simulation of branched structures and is shown to be ergodic. Detailed numerical tests for random and self-avoiding walks are performed for d= 2. For SAWs the power law for the mean-square displacement for inner monomers, g (t)= tVd+ d/2*·))(at0*, d= 2), is clearly found. Also, an anomaly in the static structure function S (k), which is typical for d= 2 linear polymers, was found.

Particular attention is paid to the region around the temperature Ta below which the polymer becomes adsorbed to the wall, i.e., where the typical polymer linear dimensions perpendicular to the wall become independent of chain length. Both ideal noninteracting chains and chains with excluded volume interactions are treated. Polymer linear dimensions parallel and perpendicular to the wall and their probability distributions are studied, as well as the behavior of the monomer fraction at the surface and a distance z in the interior.

The phase diagram contains both a melting transition and a transition from fcc to bcc crystalline phases. These phase transitions have been studied as a function of potential shape (screening length) and compared to phenomenological criteria for transition temperatures such as those of Lindemann and of Hansen and Verlet. The transition from fcc to bcc with increasing temperature is shown to result from a higher entropy in the bcc phase because of its softer shear modes. Even when the stable solid phase below the melting temperature is fcc, bcc‐like local order is found in the liquid phase. This may substantially slow crystallization.

In a manner similar to that of entangled ropes, polymer chains can slide past but not through each other. Tube models of polymer dynamics and rheology are based on the idea that entanglements confine a chain to small fluctuations around a primitive path that follows the coarse-grained chain contour.

Experimental measurements of the osmotic pressure and the structure factor are reproduced. The simulations reveal a new picture of the chain structure based on calculations of the structure factor, persistence length, end‐to‐end distance, etc. We present a detailed discussion of the chain structure and a comparison with present theories.

3011,"Several methods for preparing well equilibrated melts of long chains polymers are studied. We show that the standard method in which one starts with an ensemble of chains with the correct end-to-end distance arranged randomly in the simulation cell and introduces the excluded volume rapidly, leads to deformation on short length scales. This deformation is strongest for long chains and relaxes only after the chains have moved their own size. Two methods are shown to overcome this local deformation of the chains. One method is to first pre-pack the Gaussian chains, which reduces the density fluctuations in the system, followed by a gradual introduction of the excluded volume. The second method is a double-bridging algorithm in which new bonds are formed across a pair of chains, creating two new chains each substantially different from the original.

Moreover, the “layering algorithm” recently described by Rapaport can be incorporated. A standard Fortran formulation of the basic procedure is given.

In addition it is possible to switch between the atomistic and the CG levels of resolution on demand through an inverse mapping procedure. By this we obtain representative large-scale atomistic coordinates based on CG structures and long-time atomistic trajectories generated from CG mesoscale …",Christine Peter and Luigi Delle Site and Kurt Kremer,95,2482617904009509731,Soft Matter,4,859-869,Royal Society of Chemistry,Classical simulations from the atomistic to the mesoscale and back: coarse graining an azobenzene liquid crystal,https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2008/sm/b717324e,4,2008

Nonetheless, even the most powerful computational resources presently available are, in general, sufficient to simulate complex biomolecules only for a few nanoseconds. This limitation is often circumvented by using coarse-grained models, in which only a subset of the system’s degrees of freedom is retained; for an effective and insightful use of these simplified models; however, an appropriate parametrization of the interactions is of fundamental importance. Additionally, in many cases the removal of fine-grained details in a specific, small region of the system would destroy relevant features; such cases can be treated using dual-resolution simulation methods, where a subregion of the system is described with high resolution, and a coarse-grained representation is employed in the rest of the simulation domain.

However, for x≠ x s, the decay is significantly faster.",GS Grest and K Kremer and ER Duering,70,8236216566850131437,EPL (Europhysics Letters),3,195,IOP Publishing,Kinetics of end crosslinking in dense polymer melts,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/19/3/008/meta,19,1992
3117,"We present a detailed study of the static and dynamic behaviors of long semiflexible polymer chains in a melt. Starting from previously obtained fully equilibrated high molecular weight polymer melts [G. Zhang et al., ACS Macro Lett. 3, 198 (2014)], we investigate their static and dynamic scaling behaviors as predicted by theory. We find that for semiflexible chains in a melt, results of the mean square internal distance, the probability distributions of the end-to-end distance, and the chain structure factor are well described by theoretical predictions for ideal chains. We examine the motion of monomers and chains by molecular dynamics simulations using the ESPResSo++ package. The scaling predictions of the mean squared displacement of inner monomers, center of mass, and relations between them based on the Rouse and the reptation theory are verified, and related characteristic relaxation times are determined …",Hsiao-Ping Hsu and Kurt Kremer,69,1999454882110902931,The Journal of Chemical Physics,15,154907,AIP Publishing LLC,Static and dynamic properties of large polymer melts in equilibrium,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4946033,144,2016
3118,"Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was employed to study the diffusion of molecular tracers in different polymer melts (polydimethysiloxane (PDMS), 1,4-cis-polyisoprene (PI), poly(vinylethylene) (PVE), and a symmetric PI/PVE blend) as a function of molecular weight (Mw) and temperature (T). The single molecule sensitivity of the FCS technique precludes any modification of the matrix polymer properties. In all studied systems, the small tracer diffusion coefficient D(Mw,T) senses local segmental dynamics depending on the glass transition temperature Tg(Mw) of the polymer matrix and not its macroscopic viscosity. From the good representation of the D(T) data by the common non-Arrhenius (VFT) function, we found that the activation energy (BD) increases with tracer size (R) and for a given tracer the value of BD in PI is almost 2 times bigger than in PDMS.

Starting from the sublinear dependence of the electrostatic persistence length L e on the screening parameter for flexible chains, the corresponding effective exponent y (L e~ κ− y) crosses over to values up to 2 when the intrinsic persistence length L 0 exceeds the electrostatic one L e. L P shows a pronounced minimum with increasing intrinsic stiffness due to the occurrence of two relevant length scales which influence each other.

Both molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods provide direct evidence for the reptation model and give a rather detailed picture of the motion of linear polymers at high density. Mapping the results onto various chemical polymers allow one to predict the time and length scale for the crossover from Rouse to reptation for a variety of polymers. In the free-draining limit one finds that the entanglement length is proportional to the excluded volume screening length of the semidilute solution.

The lengthl 1 is defined in terms of suitable interior distances of the original chain, andh 1 is found from the condition that the end-to-end distance is left invariant. This renormalization group procedure is carried through by various Monte-Carlo methods (simple sampling is found advantageous for short enough chains or high dimensionalities, while dynamic methods involving “kinkjumps” or “reptation” are used else).

We find that the preferential binding of methanol with PNIPAm side chains, bridging distal monomers along the polymer backbone, results in increased organization. Furthermore, methanol–PNIPAm preferential binding is dominated by hydrogen bonding. Our findings reveal that the collapse of PNIPAm is dominated by enthalpic interactions and that the standard poor solvent (entropic) effects play no major role.",Debashish Mukherji and Manfred Wagner and Mark D Watson and Svenja Winzen and Tiago E de Oliveira and Carlos M Marques and Kurt Kremer,66,5090580987126172373,Soft Matter,38,7995-8003,The Royal Society of Chemistry,Relating side chain organization of PNIPAm with its conformation in aqueous methanol,https://pubs.rsc.org/doi/c6sm01789d,12,2016

A long lasting debate in this context regards the mutual influence of the hydrophobic solute into the bulk water and the role of the hydrogen bond network of the bulk in supporting the solvation structure around a hydrophobic molecule. In this context we present a molecular dynamics study of the solvation of various hydrophobic molecules where the effect of different regions around the solvent can be analyzed by employing an adaptive resolution method, which can systematically separate local and nonlocal factors in the structure of water around a hydrophobic molecule.

This methodology can not only be used to reduce the CPU time demand of atomistic simulations but also to systematically investigate the relative influence of different interactions on structure formation. For this, we vary the thickness of the all atom layer of toluene around the C60 and analyze the first toluene layers in comparison to a full bulk simulation.",Sebastian Fritsch and Christoph Junghans and Kurt Kremer,64,335402537162364238,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2,398-403,American Chemical Society,Structure formation of toluene around C60: Implementation of the adaptive resolution scheme (AdResS) into GROMACS,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct200706f,8,2012

In the simulations we use a coarse-grained charged bead-spring model in a dielectric continuum, with explicit counterions and full electrostatic interactions under periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The Poisson–Boltzmann hydrogel model is that of a single charged colloid confined to a spherical cell where the counterions are allowed to enter the uniformly charged sphere. In order to investigate the origin of the differences these two models may give, we performed a variety of simulations of different hydrogel models which were designed to test for the influence of charge correlations, excluded volume interactions, arrangement of charges along the polymer chains, and thermal fluctuations in the chains of the gel.

Instead of considering a central bare charge, as it is traditionally done, we distribute discrete charges randomly on the sphere. We use molecular dynamics simulations to study this effect on various properties such as overcharging, counterion distribution and diffusion. In the vicinity of the colloid surface the electrostatic potential may considerably differ from the one obtained with a central charge. In the strong Coulomb coupling, we showed that the colloidal charge discretization qualitatively influences the counterion distribution and leads to a strong colloidal charge-counterion pair association.

We conducted NVT molecular dynamics simulations of both bulk and planar confined polymer liquids. We find that both pressure and surface tension increase with l0/d0. We attribute this sensitivity to the reduction in short range liquid ordering, classically observed for simple fluids, when l0/d0<1, and its persistence and even enhancement when l0/d0>1.

After that, we show that under strong electrostatic coupling conditions one can also obtain complexations, where chain and colloid carry the same charge (like-charge complexation). This effect is due to counterion correlation effects.
