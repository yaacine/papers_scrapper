22008,"Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) can derive from diet or from α-linolenic acid (ALA) by elongation and desaturation. We investigated the association of common genetic variation with plasma phospholipid levels of the four major n-3 PUFAs by performing genome-wide association studies in five population-based cohorts comprising 8,866 subjects of European ancestry. Minor alleles of SNPs in FADS1 and FADS2 (desaturases) were associated with higher levels of ALA (p = 3×10−64) and lower levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, p = 5×10−58) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, p = 4×10−154). Minor alleles of SNPs in ELOVL2 (elongase) were associated with higher EPA (p = 2×10−12) and DPA (p = 1×10−43) and lower docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, p = 1×10−15). In addition to genes in the n-3 pathway, we identified a novel association of DPA with several SNPs in GCKR (glucokinase regulator, p = 1×10−8). We observed a weaker association between ALA and EPA among carriers of the minor allele of a representative SNP in FADS2 (rs1535), suggesting a lower rate of ALA-to-EPA conversion in these subjects. In samples of African, Chinese, and Hispanic ancestry, associations of n-3 PUFAs were similar with a representative SNP in FADS1 but less consistent with a representative SNP in ELOVL2.

22012,"Background Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is used to diagnose type 2 diabetes (T2D) and assess glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 18 HbA1c-associated genetic variants. These variants proved to be classifiable by their likely biological action as erythrocytic (also associated with erythrocyte traits) or glycemic (associated with other glucose-related traits). In this study, we tested the hypotheses that, in a very large scale GWAS, we would identify more genetic variants associated with HbA1c and that HbA1c variants implicated in erythrocytic biology would affect the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c. We therefore expanded the number of HbA1c-associated loci and tested the effect of genetic risk-scores comprised of erythrocytic or glycemic variants on incident diabetes prediction and on prevalent diabetes screening performance. Throughout this multiancestry study, we kept a focus on interancestry differences in HbA1c genetics performance that might influence race-ancestry differences in health outcomes.   Methods & findings Using genome-wide association meta-analyses in up to 159,940 individuals from 82 cohorts of European, African, East Asian, and South Asian ancestry, we identified 60 common genetic variants associated with HbA1c. We classified variants as implicated in glycemic, erythrocytic, or unclassified biology and tested whether additive genetic scores of erythrocytic variants (GS-E) or glycemic variants (GS-G) were associated with higher T2D incidence in multiethnic longitudinal cohorts (N = 33,241).

22015,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is more prevalent in African Americans than in Europeans. However, little is known about the genetic risk in African Americans despite the recent identification of more than 70 T2D loci primarily by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In order to investigate the genetic architecture of T2D in African Americans, the MEta-analysis of type 2 DIabetes in African Americans (MEDIA) Consortium examined 17 GWAS on T2D comprising 8,284 cases and 15,543 controls in African Americans in stage 1 analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analysis was conducted in each study under the additive model after adjustment for age, sex, study site, and principal components. Meta-analysis of approximately 2.6 million genotyped and imputed SNPs in all studies was conducted using an inverse variance-weighted fixed effect model. Replications were performed to follow up 21 loci in up to 6,061 cases and 5,483 controls in African Americans, and 8,130 cases and 38,987 controls of European ancestry.

Methods: We recruited 503 incident cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction between 1994 and 1998 in Costa Rica. We used a case-crossover design to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: The RR of myocardial infarction in the hour after coffee intake was 1.49 (95% CI = 1.17-1.89). Occasional coffee drinkers (≤1 cup/day, n = 103) had a RR of myocardial infarction of 4.14 (2.03-8.42), moderate coffee drinkers (2-3 cups/day, n = 280) had a RR of 1.60 (1.16-2.21), and heavy coffee drinkers (≥4 cups/d, n = 120) had a RR of 1.06 (0.69-1.63; P = 0.006, test of homogeneity).

We recently identified a risk haplotype spanning SLC16A11 that explains ∼20% of the increased T2D prevalence in Mexico. Here, through genetic fine-mapping, we define a set of tightly linked variants likely to contain the causal allele(s). We show that variants on the T2D-associated haplotype have two distinct effects: (1) decreasing SLC16A11 expression in liver and (2) disrupting a key interaction with basigin, thereby reducing cell-surface localization. Both independent mechanisms reduce SLC16A11 function and suggest SLC16A11 is the causal gene at this locus.

Though spring water is considered to be aesthetically acceptable for domestic use, presence of poorly designed pit latrines, poor solid waste management as well as poor and inadequate spring protection, may lead to contamination of spring water with pathogenic bacteria.Objectives: The objectives of the study were to examine the bacteriological quality of water from ten springs in Katwe and Kisenyi parishes of Kampala, and to identify and quantify risks for spring water contamination with faecal bacteria.Methods: A cross-sectional sanitary risk assessment using a standardised format was carried out in ten randomly selected springs in the parishes of Katwe and Kisenyi parishes in Kampala. A total of 80 samples of water from these springs were collected from December 2001 to March 2002. The samples were analysed for indicators of faecal contamination: total coliforms, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci. Physico-chemical parameters were measured.Results: Aggregate qualitative sanitary risk scores ranged from medium to high. The total coliform counts in 90% of the samples exceeded the WHO guideline for drinking water. All the samples had faecal coliform counts above the WHO guideline.

Although TFAs are obtained from diet, little is known about subsequent influences (e.g., relating to incorporation, metabolism, or intercompetition with other fatty acids) that could alter circulating concentrations and possibly modulate or mediate impacts on health. Objective: The objective was to elucidate novel biologic pathways that may influence circulating TFAs by evaluating associations between common genetic variation and TFA biomarkers. Design: We performed meta-analyses using 7 cohorts of European-ancestry participants (n = 8013) having measured genome-wide variation in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and circulating TFA biomarkers (erythrocyte or plasma phospholipids), including trans-16:1n–7, total trans-18:1, trans/cis-18:2 …",Dariush Mozaffarian and Edmond K Kabagambe and Catherine O Johnson and Rozenn N Lemaitre and Ani Manichaikul and Qi Sun and Millennia Foy and Lu Wang and Howard Wiener and Marguerite R Irvin and Stephen S Rich and Hongyu Wu and Majken K Jensen and Daniel I Chasman and Audrey Y Chu and Myriam Fornage and Lyn Steffen and Irena B King and Barbara McKnight and Bruce M Psaty and Luc Djousse and Ida YD Chen and Jason HY Wu and David S Siscovick and Paul M Ridker and Michael Y Tsai and Eric B Rimm and Frank B Hu and Donna K Arnett,38,9190335404384839250,The American journal of clinical nutrition,2,398-406,Oxford University Press,Genetic loci associated with circulating phospholipid trans fatty acids: a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from the CHARGE Consortium,https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/101/2/398/4494397,101,2015,/scholar?cites=9190335404384839250,iTloox8AAAAJ:uLbwQdceFCQC

We assessed the association of serum phosphate with early mortality among HIV-infected adults with severe malnutrition and/or advanced immunosuppression.  Methodology/Principal Findings An observational cohort of 142 HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Lusaka, Zambia with body mass index (BMI) <16 kg/m2 or CD4+ lymphocyte count <50 cells/µL, or both, was followed prospectively during the first 12 weeks of ART. Detailed health and dietary intake history, review of systems, physical examination, serum metabolic panel including phosphate, and serum ferritin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were monitored. The primary outcome was mortality. Baseline serum phosphate was a significant predictor of mortality; participants alive at 12 weeks had a median value of 1.30 mmol/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.04, 1.43), compared to 1.06 mmol/L (IQR: 0.89, 1.27) among those who died (p<0.01). Each 0.1 mmol/L increase in baseline phosphate was associated with an incremental decrease in mortality (AHR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95). The association was independent of other metabolic parameters and known risk factors for early ART-associated mortality in sub-Saharan Africa.

22081,"The association between coffee intake and risk of myocardial infarction (MI) remains controversial [1, 2]. Coffee is a major source of caffeine, which is metabolized by the polymorphic CYP1A2 enzyme. An A to C substitution at position 734 (CYP1A2* 1F) in the CYP1A2 gene decreases enzyme inducibility as measured by plasma or urinary [caffeine]/[caffeine metabolite] ratio after a dose of caffeine, resulting in impaired caffeine metabolism [3]. Individuals who are homozygous for the CYP1A2* 1A allele (A/A) are ‘‘rapid’’caffeine metabolizers whereas carriers of the variant CYP1A2* 1F are ‘‘slow’’caffeine metabolizers. The objective of this study was to determine whether CYP1A2 genotype modifies the association between coffee consumption and risk of MI. Cases (n= 2,014) with a first acute non-fatal MI and population-based controls (n= 2,014) were genotyped by RFLP-PCR. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess coffee intake. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. For carriers of the slow* 1F allele, the ORs (95% CI) for risk of MI associated with consuming\1, 1, 2–3 and 4 or more cups/day were 1.00 (reference), 0.99 (0.69–1.44), 1.36 (1.01–1.83), and 1.64 (1.14–2.34), respectively.

22117,"Background Trans fatty acids (TFA) lower HDL and increase triglyceride concentrations while polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) lower triglycerides and may decrease HDL concentrations. The effect of the interaction between trans fat and PUFA on lipids is uncertain.   Methods Men and women (n = 1032) in the Genetics of Lipid-Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) study were included. Fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes were measured with gas chromatography while data on potential confounders were obtained from questionnaires. To test the interaction between total erythrocyte PUFA (ePUFA) and TFA (eTFA) on lipid concentrations we distributed eTFA into tertiles and dichotomized ePUFA at the median concentration.

22126,"Background. Low body mass index (BMI) at antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation is associated with early mortality, but the etiology is not well understood. We hypothesized that low pretreatment serum phosphate, a critical cellular metabolism intermediate primarily stored in skeletal muscle, may predict mortality within the first 12 weeks of ART. Methods. We prospectively studied 352 HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Lusaka, Zambia to estimate the odds of death for each 0.1 mmol/L decrease in baseline phosphate after adjusting for established predictors of mortality. Results. The distribution of phosphate values was similar across BMI categories (median value 1.2 mmol/L). Among the 145 participants with BMI                 18.5 kg/m2, 28 (19%) died within 12 weeks. Lower pretreatment serum phosphate was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.24 per 0.1 mmol/L decrement, 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.47;                 ) after adjusting for sex, age, and CD4+ lymphocyte count. A similar relationship was not observed among participants with BMI ≥18.5 kg/m2 (OR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.76 to 1.21;                 ). Conclusions.

22127,"Background/Aims The LDL receptor-related protein-1 gene (LRP-1) has been associated with obesity in animal models, but no such association has yet been reported in humans. As data suggest this increase in fat mass may be mediated through a mechanism involving the clearance of plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL), where the LRP interacts with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) on chylomicron remnants, we aimed to examine (1) whether there was an association between 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on LRP-1 with body mass index (BMI) and (2) whether any association between LRP-1 SNPs and BMI could be modified by polymorphisms on the ApoE gene when comparing the wild type ε3/ε3 genotype against mutant ApoE allele (ε2/ε4) carriers.   Methods/Results We used data from 1,036 men and women (mean age±SD = 49±16 y) participating in the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN) Study. Mixed linear models, which controlled for age, sex, alcohol intake and smoking, as well as family pedigree and center of data collection were calculated.

In subsequent mixed linear models that included main effects of LRP-1 I10701 SNP and ApoE alleles, and an interaction term the two genotypes, there was no interaction detected between the LRP-1 I70701 genotype with either the ApoE ε2 or ε4 allele carriers (P>0.05).

Although some OCSFA (e.g., C15:0 and C17:0) are found in meats and dairy products, sources and metabolism of C19:0 and C23:0 are relatively unknown, and the influence of non-dietary determinants, including genetic factors, on circulating levels of OCSFA is not established.   Objective To elucidate the biological processes that influence circulating levels of OCSFA by investigating associations between genetic variation and OCSFA.   Design We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of plasma phospholipid/erythrocyte levels of C15:0, C17:0, C19:0, and C23:0 among 11,494 individuals of European descent. We also investigated relationships between specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lactase (LCT) gene, associated with adult-onset lactase intolerance, with circulating levels of dairy-derived OCSFA, and evaluated associations of candidate sphingolipid genes with C23:0 levels.

Despite this great achievement, cardiovascular risk remains high, especially among the elderly (>65 years) and those with conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease. It is thus crucial to identify variables that modulate effectiveness and efficacy of statin therapy. Alcohol, a common dietary component, is widely consumed at varying amounts and often concomitantly with statin therapy. Since moderate alcohol consumption is associated with cardiovascular benefits while heavy intake increases risk for ill health, it is possible that moderate alcohol may enhance benefits from statins while heavy alcohol could diminish or even abrogate such benefits.

Accumulating evidence has suggested that plasma and erythrocyte MUFA levels are associated with cardiometabolic disorders, including CVD, T2D, and metabolic syndrome (MS). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified seven loci for plasma and erythrocyte palmitoleic and oleic acid levels in populations of European origin. To identify additional MUFA-associated loci and the potential functional variant at each locus, we performed ethnic-specific GWAS meta-analyses and trans-ethnic meta-analyses in more than 15,000 participants of Chinese and European ancestry. We identified novel genome-wide significant associations for vaccenic acid at FADS1/2 and PKD2L1 [log10(Bayes factor) ≥ 8.07] and for gondoic acid at FADS1/2 and GCKR [log10(Bayes factor) ≥ 6.22], and also observed improved fine-mapping resolutions at FADS1/2 and GCKR loci.

22170,"Between August and October 2000, a cross-sectional study was conducted in smallholder dairy farms in Mbale district, Uganda to assess the prevalence of ticks and tick-borne diseases under different grazing systems and agro-ecological zones (AEZs) and understand the circumstances under which farmers operated. A questionnaire was administered to capture information on dairy farm circumstances and practices. A total of 102 farms were visited and sera and ticks were collected from 478 animals. Sero-prevalence of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) was determined using an ELISA. Acaricides were used indiscriminately but the intensity of their use varied with the grazing system and AEZ. Cattle from different farms mixed for various reasons. During the dry seasons farmers have to get additional fodder from outside their farms. The prevalence of ticks and serum antibodies to tick-borne infections differed across the grazing systems and AEZs. The highest serum antibody prevalence (>60%) was recorded in the lowland AEZ under the free range and tethering grazing systems. The lowest tick challenge and serum antibody levels (<50%) were recorded in the midland and upland AEZs under zero- 2 grazing system. These findings suggest that endemic stability to East Coast Fever, babesiosis and anaplasmosis is most likely to have existed in the lowland AEZ, particularly, under the tethering and free-range grazing systems. Also, endemic stability for babesiosis existed in the upland AEZs. Endemic instability for ECF existed in the midland and upland AEZs.

This study involved 1518 goats which were distributed in 145 herds in 5 districts, namely Kumi, Masaka, Mbarara, Soroti and Ssembabule. Cluster sampling was used to select farms across the two regions. A questionnaire on goat health, management and constraints to production was administered to 145 goat owners. Blood and nasal swabs were collected from a random sample of goats. For each goat a physical examination was performed to detect presence of clinical conditions. Serological assays for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and brucellosis were performed. Bacterial cultures were done to isolate the genera of bacteria in goats with clinical respiratory conditions (CRC). Another aspect of this study involved collection of gastrointestinal tracts from the abattoir to determine the prevalent nematode worm types and corresponding burdens as assessed through worm and fecal egg counts. Brucella melitensis was detected in 9.8%(141/1446) of the goats and these were distributed in 43.4% of the farms. Abortions were reported in 52% of the herds.

Timely measurements of levels and trends in under-5 mortality are important to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) target of reduction of child mortality by two thirds from 1990 to 2015, and to identify models of success.We generated updated estimates of child mortality in early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (7-28 days), postneonatal (29-364 days), childhood (1-4 years), and under-5 (0-4 years) age groups for 188 countries from 1970 to 2013, with more than 29,000 survey, census, vital registration, and sample registration datapoints. We used Gaussian process regression with adjustments for bias and non-sampling error to synthesise the data for under-5 mortality for each country, and a separate model to estimate mortality for more detailed age groups. We used explanatory mixed effects regression models to assess the association between under-5 mortality and income per person, maternal education, HIV child death rates, secular shifts, and other factors. To quantify the contribution of these different factors and birth numbers to the change in numbers of deaths in under-5 age groups from 1990 to 2013, we used Shapley decomposition. We used estimated rates of change between 2000 and 2013 to construct under-5 mortality rate scenarios out to 2030.We estimated that 6·3 million (95% UI 6·0-6·6) children under-5 died in 2013, a 64% reduction from 17·6 million (17·1-18·1) in 1970. In 2013, child mortality rates ranged from 152·5 per 1000 livebirths (130·6-177·4) in Guinea …",Ibrahim Abubakar and Gokalp Kadri Yentur and Farshad Farzadfar and Kenji Shibuya and Jürgen C Schmidt and Konstantinos Stroumpoulis and Marissa Iannarone and Jonathan R Carapetis and Ivy Shiue and Ted R Miller and Mark J Nieuwenhuijsen and Zacharie Tsala Dimbuene and Yang C Yang and Jonas M Kinge and Johanna M Geleijnse and Massimo Cirillo and Mohammad T Hedayati and Vivekanand Jha and Angel J Paternina Caicedo and Christopher JL Murray and Nataliya Foigt and Stefan Ma and Kim Yun Jin and Barthelemy Kuate Defo and Lesley Rushton and Matthew M Coates and Zanfina Ademi and Stein Emil Vollset and Tasara T Mazorodze and Lorenzo Monasta and Ziad A Memish and Hywel C Williams and Ivo Rakovac and Kaushalendra Kumar and Mall Leinsalu and Logan Sandar and David Rojas-Rueda and Mohammad H Forouzanfar and Sergey S Soshnikov and Luciano A Sposato and Stephen S Lim and Majed Masoud Asad and G Anil Kumar and Iuri da Costa Leite and Katherine T Lofgren and Shankuan Zhu and Maia Kereselidze and Chakib Nejjari and Mohammad Yahya Saeedi and Linh Ngoc Bui and Carly E Levitz and Ana Maria Nogales Vasconcelos and Xiaofeng Liang and Joanna Moschandreas and Xuan Che and Ayse Abbasoglu Ozgoren and Guohong Jiang and Ravi B Kumar and Saleem M Rana and Samaya Ismayilova and Luca Ronfani and Sajjad UR Rahman and Semaw Ferede Abera and Magdalena M Muszynska and Simon Hay and Tolesa Bekele and Karen Fern Greenwell and Joshua A Salomon and Yichong Li and Edmond Kato Kabagambe and Shams Eldin Ali Hassan Khalifa and Michelle L Bell and Knud Juel and Adansi A Amankwaa and Walter Mendoza and Damian G Hoy and Karen J Courville and Carolina Maria Teixeira and Bradford D Gessner and Maigeng Zhou and Rahul Gupta and Ulrich O Mueller and Berrak Bora Basara and Jost B Jonas and Chuanhua Yu and Mohammad Taufiq Mashal and Elena Alvarez and Dhruv S Kazi and Takayoshi Ohkubo and Kebede Deribe and Robert Quentin Reilly and Yanping Wang and Gonghuan Yang and Nicholas Breitborde and Dan Pope and Hilda L Harb and Kovin S Naidoo and Zewdie Aderaw Alemu and William T Msemburi and Ademola Adelekan and Peter J Allen and Ruben Estanislao Castro and Hebe N Gouda and Alan J Thomson and Rob E Dorrington and Paulo A Lotufo and Ami R Moore and Alan D Lopez and Vasiliy Victorovich Vlassov and Abbas Ali Mahdi and Austin E Schumacher and Philimon Gona and Ana C Garcia and Vegard Skirbekk and Karen M Edmond and Nigel G Bruce and Soufiane Boufous and Naohiro Yonemoto and Meghan D Mooney and Theo Vos and Hwashin Hyun Shin and Jasvinder A Singh and Ronan Anthony Lyons and Ketevan Goginashvili and Young-Ho Khang and Rakhi Dandona and Anand Dayama and Luke Nyakarahuka and Yousef Saleh Khader and Edward J Mills and Jun She and Karzan Abdulmuhsin Mohammad and Stephen Waller and Walid Ammar and Costas A Christophi and Paul Yip and Solveig Argeseanu Cunningham and Sergei Petrovich Ermakov and H Dean Hosgood and Mohsen Naghavi and Ferrán Catalá-Lopéz and Eric L Ding and Mouhanad Hammami and Tom Achoki and Farshad Pourmalek and Ting-Wu Chuang and David O Carpenter and John J McGrath and Samath D Dharmaratne and Yohannes Kinfu,0,,"Lancet (London, England)",9947,,,"Global, regional, and national levels of neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality during 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013",http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=15796017861917978356&hl=en&oi=scholarr,384,2014,,iTloox8AAAAJ:2tRrZ1ZAMYUC
