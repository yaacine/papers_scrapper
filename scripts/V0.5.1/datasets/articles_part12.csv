12035,"These guidelines represent an update of those published in 1996 and are intended for physicians who are involved in the preoperative, operative, and postoperative care of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. They provide a framework for considering cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery in a variety of patient and surgical situations. The overriding theme of these guidelines is that preoperative intervention is rarely necessary simply to lower the risk of surgery unless such intervention is indicated irrespective of the preoperative context. The purpose of preoperative evaluation is not simply to give medical clearance but rather to perform an evaluation of the patient’s current medical status; make recommendations concerning the evaluation, management, and risk of cardiac problems over the entire perioperative period; and provide a clinical risk profile that the patient, primary physician, anesthesiologist, and surgeon …",Committee Members and Kim A Eagle and Peter B Berger and Hugh Calkins and Bernard R Chaitman and Gordon A Ewy and Kirsten E Fleischmann and Lee A Fleisher and James B Froehlich and Richard J Gusberg and Jeffrey A Leppo and Thomas Ryan and Robert C Schlant and William L Winters Jr and Raymond J Gibbons and Elliott M Antman and Joseph S Alpert and David P Faxon and Valentin Fuster and Gabriel Gregoratos and Alice K Jacobs and Loren F Hiratzka and Richard O Russell and Sidney C Smith Jr,2082,9943471103276575977,,10,1257-1267,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,ACC/AHA guideline update for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery—executive summary a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart …,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.105.10.1257,105,2002,/scholar?cites=9943471103276575977,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:F_tUKv7nyWgC

This paper reports, for the first time, the distribution of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (VDR), and 1α-hydroxylase (1α-OHase), the enzyme responsible for the formation of the active vitamin in the human brain. The receptor and the enzyme were found in both neurons and glial cells in a regional and layer-specific pattern. The VDR was restricted to the nucleus whilst 1α-OHase was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The distribution of the VDR in human brain was strikingly similar to that reported in rodents. Many regions contained equivalent amounts of both the VDR and 1α-OHase, however the macrocellular cells within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum expressed 1α-OHase in the absence of …",Darryl W Eyles and Steven Smith and Robert Kinobe and Martin Hewison and John J McGrath,1336,1794256898392905619,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,1,21-30,Elsevier,Distribution of the vitamin D receptor and 1α-hydroxylase in human brain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061804001176,29,2005,/scholar?cites=1794256898392905619,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:SFOYbPikdlgC

However, it was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the first clinical descriptions appeared describing a connection between the formation of a thrombus in a coronary artery and its associated clinical features (2, 3). Despite these landmark observations, considerable time elapsed before general clinical acceptance of this entity was achieved, in part due to one autopsy study that showed no thrombi in the coronary arteries of 31% of deceased patients with an MI (4).

In addition, the safety and efficacy of long-term application of topical capsaicin in PHN was assessed by following patients in an open-label study for up to 2 years. In the double-blind phase, 143 patients with PHN of 6 months' duration or longer were enrolled. Since epidemiologic studies of patients who receive no treatment have shown that only 10% to 25% of those with PHN after 1 month will still have pain at 1 year, two separate efficacy analyses were performed: one with all evaluable patients (n= 131) and the other with 93 patients whose PHN lasted for longer than 12 months prior to study startup. All efficacy variables, including the physician's global evaluation of reduction in PHN pain, changes in pain severity on the categoric scale, visual analogue scale for pain severity, visual analogue scale for pain relief, and functional capacity scale, showed significant improvement at nearly all time points throughout the study for both patient groups, based on duration of PHN pain. In contrast, the group receiving vehicle cream remained essentially unchanged. Data from the long-term, open-label phase (up to 2 years, n= 77), which immediately followed the 6-week blinded phase, showed that the clinical benefit in patients treated for a short (6-week) period with topical capsaicin could be maintained or amplified in most patients (86%) during prolonged therapy.

Our study compared the renal allograft survival of patients with AHR treated with plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with allograft survival in patients with acute cellular rejection (ACR).Methods. We retrospectively analyzed all kidney transplants performed at our institution between January 1999 and August 2001 (n= 286). Recipients were classified into three groups according to biopsy reports: AHR, ACR, or no rejection. The ACR group was further divided into early and late rejection (< 90 and> 90 days posttransplant, respectively).Results. After a mean follow-up of 569±19 days, the incidence of AHR was 5.6%(n= 16).

12183,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, the use of wild type native FGF21 is challenging due to several limitations. Among these are its short half-life, its susceptibility to in vivo proteolytic degradation and its propensity to in vitro aggregation. We here describe a rationale-based protein engineering approach to generate a potent long-acting FGF21 analog with improved resistance to proteolysis and aggregation. A recombinant Fc-FGF21 fusion protein was constructed by fusing the Fc domain of human IgG1 to the N-terminus of human mature FGF21 via a linker peptide. The Fc positioned at the N-terminus was determined to be superior to the C-terminus as the N-terminal Fc fusion retained the βKlotho binding affinity and the in vitro and in vivo potency similar to native FGF21. Two specific point mutations were introduced into FGF21. The leucine to arginine substitution at position 98 (L98R) suppressed FGF21 aggregation at high concentrations and elevated temperatures. The proline to glycine replacement at position 171 (P171G) eliminated a site-specific proteolytic cleavage of FGF21 identified in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. The derived Fc-FGF21(RG) molecule demonstrated a significantly improved circulating half-life while maintaining the in vitro activity similar to that of wild type protein. The half-life of Fc-FGF21(RG) was 11 h in mice and 30 h in monkeys as compared to 1-2 h for native FGF21 or Fc-FGF21 wild type.

It is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. MI may be the first manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD) or it may occur, repeatedly, in patients with established disease. Information on MI rates can provide useful information regarding the burden of CAD within and across populations, especially if standardized data are collected in a manner that distinguishes between incident and recurrent events. From the epidemiological point of view, the incidence of MI in a population can be used as a proxy for the prevalence of CAD in that population. The term ‘myocardial infarction’may have major psychological and legal implications for the individual and society. It is an indicator of one of the leading health problems in the world and it is an outcome measure in clinical trials, observational studies and quality assurance programmes.

Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian.

Thus, ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that fibrinolysis be provided within 30 minutes of first medical system contact and that primary PCI be provided within 90 minutes of first medical system contact for patients presenting with STEMI. 1 These guideline recommendations have been translated into performance measures that are reported to the public by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Joint Commission. 2, 3 …",WRITING COMMITTEE MEMBERS and Frederick A Masoudi and Robert O Bonow and Ralph G Brindis and Christopher P Cannon and Jo DeBuhr and Susan Fitzgerald and Paul A Heidenreich and Kalon KL Ho and Harlan M Krumholz and Chris Leber and David J Magid and David S Nilasena and John S Rumsfeld and Sidney C Smith Jr and Thomas P Wharton Jr,88,3990138360382566471,,24,2649-2661,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,ACC/AHA 2008 statement on Performance Measurement and Reperfusion Therapy: a report of the ACC/AHA Task Force on Performance Measures (Work Group to address the challenges of …,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.191100,118,2008,/scholar?cites=3990138360382566471,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:9PmR9Y676FQC

The goal of additional noninvasive imaging for atherosclerosis is to improve identification of individuals at a high or low risk for CHD (ie, optimize risk stratification so as few patients as possible are classified as intermediate risk). This presumes that such classification can aid physicians in prescribing a management strategy for prevention, in that patients assigned into a “high-risk” category will likely benefit from aggressive risk-factor modification, while those at low risk will less likely benefit.

12255,"Circadian variation of the onset of acute myocardial infarction has been noted in many studies and may carry important pathophysiologic implications. However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analyses. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, the peak of onset occurred in the morning from 6: 01 AM to 12: 00 noon, and 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percentage for the other time periods) experienced symptom onset in that period (p< 0.001). There was a second, lower peak (25%) in the evening between 6: 01 PM and 12: 00 midnight, which was also observed in some previous studies. We sought to determine whether or not the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n= 606) or with non-Q wave infarction (n= 832), a pronounced peak (29% o) occurred only in the evening. Two nearly equal peaks were observed in patients older than 70 years ofage (n= 1,422), smokers (n= 2,057), diabetics (n= 767), women (n= 1,213), and patients taking, B-blocking drugs (n= 847).

12257,"Ingestion of sodium is essential to health, but excess sodium intake is a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Defining an optimal range of sodium intake in populations has been challenging and controversial. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure have shown blood pressure lowering effects down to sodium intake of less than 1.5 g/day. Findings from these blood pressure trials form the basis for current guideline recommendations to reduce sodium intake to less than 2.3 g/day. However, these clinical trials employed interventions that are not feasible for population-wide implementation (i.e. feeding studies or intensive behavioural interventions), particularly in low and middle-income countries.

Shayla questioned if the implications of the Harrison study could be meaningful or even generalizable to her own study. Were Shayla's students not reading because they had knowledge of their poor reading skills and deficits in their reading levels? Did this lead to a poor self concept of themselves as readers?

Plaque fluid is already supersaturated with respect to relevant calcium phosphates at neutral pH; extra calcium may lead to surface-blocking and sub-optimal lesion consolidation. However, at cariogenic pH, lesions may be more porous to the ingress of mineral, leading to fuller consolidation, and controlled release of calcium should reduce undersaturation with respect to enamel and accelerate deposition of fluorhydroxyapatite. Clinical data to validate in vitro screening models are scarce.

METHODS: Available literature was reviewed, including searches via the National Library of medicine database and other sources. RESULTS: A review of the literature indicates that significant progress has been made since Dr. Ethan B. Russo's landmark paper, just ten years ago (February 2, 2004). Investigation at that time suggested that cannabinoids can block spinal, peripheral and gastrointestional mechanisms that promote pain in headache, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and muscle spasm. CONCLUSION: Subsequent research has confirmed that underlying endocannabinoid deficiencies indeed play a role in migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and a growing list of other medical conditions.

12301," Left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is an important measure of ventricular performance and may identify patients at increased risk for developing late clinical symptoms of heart failure (HF). The primary outcome in this analysis of 744 patients from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial was the development of death or HF over a mean time of 36 months. The mean LVEDP for all patients was 23±9 mm Hg, and 75% of participants (n=558) had an LVEDP >15 mm Hg. Patients with an LVEDP >30 mm Hg (n=187) had the highest risk of death or HF (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.97) when compared with the other 2 cohorts combined (n=603).

12307,"The major source of carbon for starch synthesis in reserve tissues such as the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber is SUC. In the developing tuber, Suc is hydrolyzed principally by Suc synthase (EC 2.4. 1.13) to UDP-Glc and Fru (Preiss, 1982). Fructokinase (EC 2.7. 1.4) is believed to catalyze the phosphorylation of the Fru released to yield Fru-6-P. This sugar phosphate can then be used to support starch synthesis following further metabolism in the cytosol and amyloplast. There are some reports (Wolosiuk and Pontis, 1974) that Suc synthase activity can undergo feedback inhibition by free Fru. In this case fructokinase potentially plays an important role in maintaining the flux of carbon toward starch formation.Fructokinase has been purified from a variety of plants including pea (Tumer et al., 1977; Copeland et al., 1984), barley (Baysdorfer et al., 1989), avocado (Copeland and Tanner, 1988), and developing …",Susan B Smith and Mark A Taylor and Lindsay R Burch and Howard V Davies,48,7116234982962009012,Plant physiology,3,1043,American Society of Plant Biologists,Primary structure and characterization of a cDNA clone of fructokinase from potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv record).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC158880/,102,1993,/scholar?cites=7116234982962009012,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:-3_NAp5WSNkC
12308,"The dose of propranolol which produces the optimal therapeutic effect in patients with angina pectoris has been found to vary widely among patients. Because the plasma concentration of propranolol also differs markedly due to interpatient variability in absorption it seemed possible that this might be the reason for the wide range of effective doses in angina and that plasma propranolol might provide a useful guide to therapeutic response. To examine this possibility we selected ten patients with coronary artery disease complicated by angina and studied them at varying propranolol doses to a maximum of 320 mg/day. Exercise capacity was tested on a treadmill and plasma propranolol concentration was measured by gas liquid chromatography. In seven normal subjects beta-blockade was quantified precisely as inhibition of exercise tachycardia and was related to plasma propranolol levels at various doses. Maximal beta-blockade occurred at 100 ng/ml of plasma propranolol, but the dose response curve of blockade was relatively flat and the ED50 of plasma propranolol was 8+/-1 ng/ml. In the patients maximal therapeutic benefit from propranolol occurred at 30+/-7 ng/ml and at a dose of 144 mg/day. This resulted in an increase in exercise capacity from an estimated 12-7+/-0-8 ml/kg/min of oxygen consumption during control to 17-2+/-1-1 ml/kg/min on the drug. Thus, there was a wide variation of both dose and concentration among these patients at the maximum therapeutic response.

In our 330-bed, nonteaching community hospital we recently completed a study that agrees with the findings by Conly et al. We also used our data to support changing our central line dressing policy to require a gauze dressing and, in a follow-up study, demonstrated a sustained reduction in the infection rate. We prospectively followed all patients with subclavian central venous lines in the critical care, general medical, and oncology units from 1 October 1985 to 31 March 1986 (phase I).

12323,"The cell-division cycle of Caulobacter crescentus depends on periodic activation and deactivation of the essential response regulator CtrA. Although CtrA is critical for transcription during some parts of the cell cycle, its activity must be eliminated before chromosome replication because CtrA also blocks the initiation of DNA replication. CtrA activity is down-regulated both by dephosphorylation and by proteolysis, mediated by the ubiquitous ATP-dependent protease ClpXP. Here we demonstrate that proteins needed for rapid CtrA proteolysis in vivo form a phosphorylation-dependent and cyclic diguanylate (cdG)-dependent adaptor complex that accelerates CtrA degradation in vitro by ClpXP.

However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation -- no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low noise level. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a Markov random field whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be observed through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model.

12343,"This book aims to reconcile theoretical models of population dynamics with what is currently known about the population dynamics of large mammalian herbivores. It arose from a working group established at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to address the need for models that better accommodate environmental variability, especially for herbivores dependent on changing vegetation resources. The initial chapter reviews findings from definitive long-term studies of certain other ungulate populations, many based on individually identifiable animals. Other chapters cover climatic influences, emphasising temperate versus tropical contrasts, and demographic processes underlying population dynamics, more generally. There are new assessments of irruptive population dynamics, and of the consequences of landscape heterogeneity for herbivore populations.

12345,"English language learners (ELLs) in today's US middle schools and high schools face significant challenges from state writing assessments, and data suggest that they do not fare well. This paper seeks to uncover some of the reasons by posing the question: What is the available research base and practice literature to help teachers prepare ELLs to meet the standards? The answer this question begins by collecting the writing standards from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; identifying major topics and themes in the standards; and reducing the total number of standards to a set of six categories that could be used to assess the research and practice literature. An extensive search was then conducted of the research and practice literature published between 1995 and 2005 that addresses adolescents, second language learning, and writing. Although the literature is extensive, only a small portion addresses US resident and immigrant ELLs in grades 7 through 13. Several historical factors that have resulted in these gaps were found:(1) Research has focused largely on post secondary and international student populations, with little focus on US resident and immigrant middle and high school students;(2) ESL teacher preparation programs focus largely on oral language development; and (3) Secondary school English teacher preparation programs rarely address working with second language learners. In addition to limiting the field of research available for review, the factors above may account for the wide gap between ELL students' writing skills and those of their English-speaking peers.

The binding profile of each anti-adipocyte antibody has been characterised using phage antibody immunocytochemistry against a panel of normal human tissues. Although there was some variation in the intensity of the adipocyte staining, each antibody consistently recognised adipocytes, where present, irrespective of the tissue source.

12370,"Umbilical cord blood banking efforts have increased dramatically in the past two decades in response to increasing demand for alternative sources of blood stem cells to support patients requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Transplant centres have accumulated increasing expertise in their understanding of umbilical cord blood characteristics that are associated with improved outcome following transplantation. These characteristics and factors can assist transplant centres in selecting cord blood units from the worldwide inventory of banked units. Umbilical cord blood banks, therefore, need to remain agile in adjusting the inventory of the banks to address shifts or changes in the needs of transplant centres. Public umbilical cord blood banks face the challenge of building inventory while managing limited resources and are faced with decisions regarding which units can be stored and which units that have been collected should be discarded or used for other endeavours such as research. To this end, we sought to review parameters influencing the decision to bank a collected cord blood unit.

We assessed the abilities of two methods to measure ejection fraction (EF)—radionuclide ventriculography (RVG) and contrast left ventriculography (Cath-EFa) to predict cardiovascular events.Background. Both RVG and Cath-EFa are commonly used methods to measure left ventricular performance and assess prognosis. Their comparative abilities to predict clinical events have not been reported.Methods. Both RVG EF and Cath-EFa were measured within 16 days of myocardial infarction (MI) in 688 patients. The results were divided into terciles. Prognosis by terciles was assessed for each technique. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine which EF measurement was a better predictor of prognosis.Results. Average RVG–EF was 32% ± 7, while Cath-EFa was 42% ± 10.

The small sample size and rapid measurement time make the routine characterization of P450 systems by resonance Raman spectroscopy easier. Addition of imidazole and imidazole derivatives as inhibitors causes the appearance of additional peaks due to vinyl modes, increases the relative intensity of symmetric modes that would be A1g in D4h symmetry, and causes a large drop in the intensity of ν11. This information indicates that the ligation of imidazoles to the heme iron causes the alignment of the vinyl modes with the plane of the heme ring and reduces the out of plane distortion of the ring. The effect of both inhibitors is similar but there is a subtle difference in the extent of the reduction in the intensity of ν11, which suggests that steric effects …",SJ Smith and AW Munro and WE Smith,31,14145034694269244002,Biopolymers: Original Research on Biomolecules,4,620-627,"Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company",Resonance Raman scattering of cytochrome P450 BM3 and effect of imidazole inhibitors,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bip.10502,70,2003,/scholar?cites=14145034694269244002,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:rKOGDx9nJ1EC

His statement is quoted in part as follows:“They have often surrendered comfortable, secure and more lucrative posts in order to devote themselves to the awakening of a public sentiment favorable to improved rural education, and to the educational guidance of communities scattered through their respective states. They have kept in the field summer and winter, in foul weather as in fair; they have made their way as best they could, by railroad, boat, motor car or wagon, and not unfrequently, where other trans-portation was lacking, afoot. At the outset not a few persons were disposed to look askance on the youthful enthusiasts, well bred and well educated, who, eschewing more pleasant and easier paths, blazed the way for the education of the Negro living on the plantation or cultivating the small family plot. In the course of a few years public opinion has been won. The state agents for the Negro rural schools are re-spected by white and black alike. They are builders of good-will.” ix",Samuel Leonard Smith,29,17841237245853876834,,,,Tennessee Book Company,"Builders of goodwill: The story of the state agents of Negro education in the south, 1910 to 1950",http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17841237245853876834&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1950,/scholar?cites=17841237245853876834,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:gVv57TyPmFsC

We provide the first insights into partially diadromous migration of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) in Australia by examining the otolith chemistry of old individuals (aged 7–10 years) from two regions on the east coast. Strontium and Barium concentrations were measured across the otolith using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and indicated considerable diversity in migratory histories among individuals.

The differences in the mean velocity fields for the two fluid types are relatively small, including the length of the recirculation region which is essentially unaffected by the fluid rheology. Although turbulent kinetic energy levels for the non-Newtonian fluids are always lower than for the Newtonian fluids, no significant difference is found in the relative contributions to the turbulent kinetic energy of the axial, radial and tangential normal stresses.

Evapotranspiration (Et) from trees reduces air temperature in the urban microclimate by converting sensible heat to latent heat. Quantification and valuation of the ecosystem services provided by urban trees is important for improving cost-benefit evaluations in support of protecting tree planting and maintenance budgets and, thus, for building climate change resilience into cities. Inclusion of Et cooling could improve ecosystem service valuation models by producing a more complete picture of the benefits that urban trees provide to society.This study explores two approaches for evaluating climate regulation as an ecosystem service of urban trees.

Several large randomized clinical trials now demonstrate the importance of medical risk reduction therapies in these patients. A consensus panel of the American Heart Association recommends that health care providers use a group of risk reduction therapies, which can significantly extend overall survival, improve quality of life, decrease the need for interventional procedures such as angioplasty and bypass grafting, and reduce the incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction.

Traditional numerical integration techniques provide accurate means of model making but prove too slow for real-time simulation of complex systems or systems with fast response. For rapid digital simulation, a simplified discrete approximation is sought for the linear integro-differential operators of a continuous system. This discrete operator, a digitized transfer function, yields difference equations hopefully permitting real-time approximation of continuous system performance on a digital computer. Determination of the discrete operator is the essential goal of each of the simulation schemes described herein, though differing initial assumptions and approximations alter the resulting forms.

Methods. Retrospective database review of patients who underwent a reduction mammaplasty between 1999 and 2009 was performed from pathology records at a single institution. Results. 700 patients were identified. Of the 644 patients who had bilateral reductions, 25 (4%) had significant pathologic findings. The likelihood of finding premalignant changes or cancer increased with advancing patient age (0.8 percent for patients <40 years old and 10 percent for patients >60 years old). Of the 56 patients who underwent unilateral mammaplasty, 12 patients (21%) had significant pathologic findings. The incidence of finding premalignant changes or cancer in this population also increased with advancing patient age (0 for patients <40 years old to 25 percent for patients >60 years old). Conclusions. When a unilateral mammaplasty is performed to match a breast reconstructed after cancer surgery, the likelihood of identifying premalignant changes or cancer increases more than fourfold.

12467,"The cleaning of fouled heat exchangers often presents a significant challenge to the maintenance and operation of chemical, petroleum and food processes. Despite efforts in the design of processes and hardware to minimize fouling, eventually the intricate interior surfaces of the exchanger require cleaning to restore the unit to required efficiencies. In situ chemical rinse methods require detailed understanding of the foulant properties, and may provide incomplete removal, particularly on the shell side (od) because of the complexity of the flow path. High pressure water blasting is very often ineffective at restoring a unit to 100% efficiency, can take considerable time and manpower, uses environmentally unfriendly amounts of water, and has proven to be a dangerous activity in routine practice. Ultrasonic cleaning has been used industrially for decades, particularly to clean small intricate parts, and to accelerate surface treatment processes. This paper will describe in detail the ultrasonic cleaning process and our experience in developing very large scale equipment and processes capable of rapidly cleaning heat exchangers up to 9.5 m in length and 2m in diameter. In a year of operation, we have encountered heat exchangers fouled with a wide variety of materials from both refinery and chemical clients. Many of the exchangers we were presented with during trials have never been successfully cleaned by any other method.

12502,"Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated β-blockers improving survival after myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with “bradycardia-related” contraindications to β-blockers, such as those with asymptomatic bradycardia or AV conduction abnormalities, have been excluded from clinical trials of β-blockers and continue to be excluded from post-MI β-blocker therapy in routine clinical practice. These patients tend to be elderly and have a high 1-year mortality. If β-blockers provide benefit to the post-MI patient independent of their heart rate–lowering effect, then these patients could benefit substantially from initiation of β-blocker therapy. However, in this particular group of patients, β-blockers can be safely initiated only if more severe or significant bradycardia can be prevented by pacemaker implantation.

12525,"The threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) approach integrates cluster information into voxel-wise statistical inference to enhance detectability of neuroimaging signal. Despite the significantly increased sensitivity, the application of TFCE is limited by several factors: (i) generalisation to data structures, like brain network connectivity data is not trivial, (ii) TFCE values are in an arbitrary unit, therefore, P-values can only be obtained by a computationally demanding permutation-test.Here, we introduce a probabilistic approach for TFCE (pTFCE), that gives a simple general framework for topology-based belief boosting.The core of pTFCE is a conditional probability, calculated based on Bayes' rule, from the probability of voxel intensity and the threshold-wise likelihood function of the measured cluster size.

12527,"Smart grid research has tended to be compartmentalised, with notable contributions from economics, electrical engineering and science and technology studies. However, there is an acknowledged and growing need for an integrated systems approach to the evaluation of smart grid initiatives. The capacity to simulate and explore smart grid possibilities on various scales is key to such an integrated approach but existing models – even if multidisciplinary – tend to have a limited focus.  This paper describes an innovative and flexible framework that has been developed to facilitate the simulation of various smart grid scenarios and the interconnected social, technical and economic networks from a complex systems perspective. The architecture is described and related to realised examples of its use, both to model the electricity system as it is today and to model futures that have been envisioned in the literature. Potential future applications of the framework are explored, along with its utility as an analytic and decision support tool for smart grid stakeholders.",R Mark Rylatt and J Richard Snape and Peter Allen and Babak M Ardestani and Peter John Boait and Ekkehard Boggasch and Denis Fan and Graham Fletcher and Rupert Gammon and Mark Lemon and VH Pakka and M Savill and Stefan Smith and M Strathern and Liz Varga,19,15052920942985090571,,,,De Gruyter,Exploring smart grid possibilities: A complex systems modelling approach,https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/11198,,2015,/scholar?cites=15052920942985090571,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:zYLM7Y9cAGgC

We have extended the range of frequencies over which hypoxia's effects have been examined to include frequencies up to 16 kHz.

12555,"With vast numbers of international students entering Australia, educational institutions and other international student service providers (including levels of government and community groups), often encounter challenges when disseminating relevant and timely information to these students. Often these challenges are compounded by many studies in the past that have focused on country of origin as a way to differentiate international students from each other. This research was born out of a need to find new, creative and effective ways of disseminating information to international students that go beyond traditional classifications. Therefore, this study argued that it is more useful to look at the sources of information from the perspective of different social network groupings than from the country of origin perspective. This is because international students are complex individuals with differing identities and information needs that are not solely located in the country/region they are born in. In order to uncover the different identities which students embrace, this research conducted focus groups to understand the social networks students belong to and to discern if there are patterns in the ways different social groups access information while in Australia. Students in the focus groups were drawn from postgraduate, undergraduate levels of study, as well as from TAFE and private colleges.

The National Kidney Foundation’s KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines for the care of patients with end-stage renal disease include screening for aluminum toxicity with plasma aluminum concentrations at least yearly and quarterly in those receiving aluminumcontaining medications (opinion). 1 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) recommends avoiding long-term use of aluminum-containing phosphate binders and, in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5, dialysate aluminum decontamination to prevent aluminum intoxication. 2 Because the acceptable dose and duration of a “short course” of an aluminumcontaining phosphate binder is not well defined and exposure to aluminum is cumulative, we have not prescribed medications known to contain aluminum at our center for the past 10 years. However, we continued to monitor aluminum concentrations in all hemodialysis patients quarterly because of concerns that exposure might continue from medications used without our knowledge, such as over-the-counter antacids and sucralfate (21% aluminum by weight), and from smaller amounts of aluminum found in other medications not typically considered dangerous to hemodialysis patients (Table 1).

12574,"This document presents the summary findings from the 34th Bethesda Conference:"" Can Atherosclerosis Imaging Techniques Improve the Detection of Patients at Risk for Ischemic Heart Disease?"" This conference, comprised of five writing groups, began the process of formulating report outlines and documents in January 2002. The conference, held October 7, 2002, at the Heart House in Bethesda, Maryland, allowed for open discussion, constructive commentary, and the formulation of summary comments resulting in the documents presented in this report. The purpose of Bethesda Conference 34 (BC 34) was to review the current status and controversies within the integration of atherosclerosis imaging into clinical cardiovascular medicine. Each Task Force was also specifically charged with developing recommendations on"" Future Directions"" for the field of atherosclerosis imaging, as appropriate within the scope of issues they considered.

This volume teaches readers to recognize the ritual needs of fellow Christians and thus create post-baptismal rites of passage and healing that might strengthen and support them in the fulfillment of their ministries. The book extends the usefulness of denominational"" occasional services"" books and other resources by suggesting ways to build a rite around a central symbolic action, pointing out issues of ritual honesty and ethics, and identifying skills and attributes necessary to preparing and leading a rite.

12588,"Building Energy Assessment at stock level is an important task in identifying the best strategies for achieving a more energy efficient and low carbon society. Non-domestic buildings are identified to make up 17% of total energy consumption in England and Wales and 19% of CO2 emissions. To understand the energy requirement of the non-domestic stock, large scale (empirically based) energy surveying has been carried out namely in the Non-Domestic Building Stock project and Carbon Reductions in Buildings project.   It is recognised that building energy surveys are difficult to carry out; expensive on time, technical resources, and metered energy use is (on a large scale) necessarily crude.   With improving computer ability, dynamic energy modelling tools allow for detailed assessment of building energy use and comfort performance. Using Monte Carlo simulation a method of assessing the probable variability in non-domestic building thermal energy loads was developed. The method was developed to capture the heterogeneity in non-domestic buildings at national stock level and determine how stock level physical form variations impact thermal loading.     Non-domestic building form and surrounding topography are considered to be influenced by building control laws and building regulations. Control documentation often stipulates guidelines and best practice - hence building heterogeneity. As such, historical regulations were used to develop basic probability distributions of potential physical characteristics associated with non-domestic buildings.

12615,"The variation in response to caffeine in animal studies is probably more marked in the field of teratology than in any other area. Although the potential of caffeine to cause congenital abnormalities in mice has been known for over 20 years1 the effects produced have been extremely variable both within and between different laboratories. All of the reasons for this variability are not understood but it is clear that it is a reflection of the fact that caffeine has only weak teratogenic potency. The review of the health aspects of caffeine prepared by the Select Committee of FASEB2 concluded that teratogenic effects of caffeine are generally absent at doses up to 50 mg/kg body weight. At 75 mg/kg caffeine the effects are neither striking nor consistent and that bolus doses greater than this are required for effects to be clear. Since the (single dose, oral acute) LD, C, of caffeine is around 250 mg/kg in rodents, the observation of teratogenic effects at around one half to one third the LD>(. would not be regarded by most teratologists as indicative of a particular risk in the use of the substance.The literature on the teratogenic effects of caffeine has been well reviewed by Collins. 34 Some of the factors involved in the variability of responses to caffeine will be mentioned and these will be discussed in the light of recent evidence on the mechanisms of teratogenicity of caffeine which has accumulated during the past 3 or 4 years.",FM Sullivan and SE Smith and PR McElhatton,14,17014739750701962896,Pharmacokinetics in teatogenesis,,123-127,"CRC Press, Inc",Interpretation of animal experiments as illustrated by studies on caffeine,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17014739750701962896&hl=en&oi=scholarr,1,1987,/scholar?cites=17014739750701962896,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:X5QHDg3V9EEC

The high affinity binding of b5 to P450 BM3 induced a low-spin to high-spin transition in the P450 heme iron (Kd for b5 binding = 0.44 μM and 0.72 μM for the heme domain and intact flavocytochrome, respectively). The b5 had modest inhibitory effects on steady-state turnover of P450 BM3 with fatty acids, and the ferrous-carbon monoxy P450 complex was substantially stabilized on binding b5.

12631,"According to real-life crash data, one of the most harmful events among all side impacts is when the driver-head hits the far-side door when the car is hit from the far side. There is currently no established test method to simulate a crash where such an event is at risk of occurring. In order to assess real life injuries and develop countermeasures for far side crashes, standardized cost-effective test methods are needed.This paper presents a bending bar sled-test set-up simulating a full-scale 9 o'clock far side crash. In the full scale crash-test a deformable barrier with a speed of 65 km/h struck the passenger side of a passenger car with a BioSID in the driver seat.

It is not known whether it is similarly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes in different regions around the world, and thus whether measuring waist circumference (WC) in addition to body mass index (BMI) is useful in primary care practice.Methods and Results-Randomly chosen primary care physicians (PCPs) in 63 countries recruited consecutive patients aged 18 to 80 years, on two pre-specified half-days. WC and BMI were measured and the presence of CVD and diabetes recorded. Of the patients consulting the PCPs, 97% agreed to participate in this study. Overall, 24% of 69,409 men and 27% of 98,750 women were obese (BMI≥ 30 kg/m²). A further 40% and 30% of men and women, respectively, were overweight (BMI 25 to 30 kg/m²). In men and women, respectively, increased WC (> 102/88cm, men/women) was recorded in 29% and 48%, CVD in 16% and 13%, and diabetes in 13% and 11%. There was a statistically significant graded increase in the frequency of CVD and diabetes with both BMI and WC, with a stronger relationship for WC than for BMI across regions, for both genders. This relationship between WC, CVD and particularly diabetes was seen even in lean patients (BMI< 25 kg/m2).Conclusions-Among men and women consulting PCPs, BMI and particularly WC were both strongly linked to CVD and especially to diabetes.

Experiment One evaluated the comparative ease of learning and retention of these three sound types, with the results demonstrating that speech warnings and auditory icons were learnt and trained with equal ease, while abstract-sound warnings were found to be learnt and retained with far greater difficulty. Experiment Two examined a users ability to respond to speech, icon and abstract auditory warnings under varying degrees of workload. The results of this experiment show that speech warnings provide and advantage in reaction time and response accuracy over auditory icon warnings, which in turn hold an advantage over abstract sounds. The results of these two experiments indicated that, under low levels of workload, speech warnings may prove to be an effective supplement to traditional visual warnings, while icons also warrant further investigation.Descriptors:",Sean E Smith and Karen L Stephan and Simon P Parker,12,11081986890378754776,,,,DEFENCE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ORGANISATION EDINBURGH (AUSTRALIA) AIR OPERATIONS DIV,Auditory warnings in the military cockpit: A preliminary evaluation of potential sound types,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA444013,,2004,/scholar?cites=11081986890378754776,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:-7ulzOJl1JYC

In this work, we synthesize novel metallomesogen compounds, namely, CuSeC12H25 and AgSeC12H25, to target shaped metal selenide NCs. We show that these compounds adopt lamellar bilayer structures and undergo mesogenic transitions at elevated temperatures. We find that structural disparities between the CuSeC12H25 and AgSeC12H25 mesophases lead to the formation of distinct two- and one-dimensional NC …",Whitney Bryks and Stephanie C Smith and Andrea R Tao,11,4329514758095664837,Chemistry of Materials,8,3653-3662,American Chemical Society,Metallomesogen templates for shape control of metal selenide nanocrystals,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b00459,29,2017,/scholar?cites=4329514758095664837,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:54SpJiyHbzwC

Subjects were 16 mother/toddler dyads with five girls and three boys in each group matched for sex, age, and birth order. Caucasian mothers were native-born Americans of European background with high school educations; their husbands worked in nonprofessional occupations. Chinese mothers were of Cantonese background with an average of 7 years residence in the United States and 10 years of schooling; none was fluent in English and all spoke Cantonese in the home. A teaching/learning task and a free-play session were videotaped in the subjects' homes. Toddler temperament questionnaires were completed by mothers after the home visit. In general, findings suggest that during toddlerhood the Caucasian mother/child system affords children considerably more experience as self-assertive agents than does the Chinese system. Chinese toddlers' experience during interactions can be described as comparatively passive.

12706,"School‐based sex education (SBSE), an institutional attempt to interrupt and correct the sexual socialization of young people, operates at the levels of structure, interaction, and culture. At the structural level SBSE has been found to endorse a particular set of cultural messages about sex and sexuality that reinforce patterns of inequality. This is often the case regardless of program type (e.g., abstinence versus comprehensive). However, there is little empirical focus on the actual classroom practices and other social interactions that constitute SBSE in the United States. In this paper, I will provide an overview of the field of SBSE research, reading the findings at the interactional level. In particular, I will review findings on curricula, stakeholder perspectives, and effects in a discussion of the importance of both interaction and culture in SBSE practices.

12711,"BackgroundCluster-level inference is generally found to be more sensitive than voxel-level inference, as it makes use of local spatial neighbourhood information to boost belief in extended areas of signal [Friston]. Standard cluster inference only makes use of the size of a cluster, whilst several alternatives to cluster size inference have been proposed which incorporate height information, including joint cluster-height inference [Poline, Hayasaka], and cluster-mass inference [Bullmore].Existing cluster size methods, however, require an explicit choice of cluster-forming threshold. As users know well, minor adjustments in this threshold can result in dramatic changes in the resulting inferences, and there is no objective method by which a sensible threshold can be chosen. In this work we propose a new approach to cluster inference which retains the power of the cluster size statistic while avoiding the specification of a cluster-forming threshold. The result is a continuous image where the intensity at a given voxel is a natural measure of local cluster support, or put another way, measures the signficance of all possible clusters that contain that voxel.",SM Smith and TE Nichols,10,12310789361777570237,"13th Annual Meeting of the OHBM, Chicago, Illinois.

Progress in these areas is in stark contrast to that for sudden cardiac death, which continues unabated at a rate of approximately 1000 times per day in the United States, with little decline in incidence or improved outcome. Clearly, the problem of sudden cardiac death is best approached through prevention, but horizons in that area seem no more promising and in some respects less promising and substantially more costly than 2 decades ago.The means necessary for successful resuscitation of a patient in cardiac arrest were known by the early 1960s.

Our approach enables deactivation of pervasive regressors and activation of weak regressors for short periods (regimes). We establish theoretical results on the concentration properties of the posterior as well as the rate of convergence for estimating the break dates. Our methodology is demonstrated in simulations and in an empirical application to firms’ choice of capital structure.

12733,"Emotional empathy is the ability to experience and/or share another person’s emotional states and responses. Although some research has examined the neural correlates of emotional empathy, there has been little research investigating whether this component of empathy is related to the functional connectivity of resting state networks in the brain. In the current study, 32 participants answered a trait emotional empathy questionnaire in a session previous to their functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Results indicate that emotional empathy scores were correlated with different patterns of functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and left and right central executive networks. For example, within the DMN, emotional empathy scores positively correlated with connectivity in the premotor cortex. Within the SN, empathy scores were positively correlated with the fusiform gyrus and cuneus. These findings demonstrate that emotional empathy is associated with unique patterns of functional connectivity in four of the brain’s resting state networks.

In this study we examine the geographical distribution of land clearing potential in the Canadian agriculture–forestry interface and propose a new landscape-scale indicator that quantifies this potential. We consider the possibility that forested land will be cleared for agriculture as a trade-off between the land's capacity to support agriculture and its comparative value if it remains forested. However, this trade-off is complicated by the land's susceptibility to fragmentation (and subsequent conversion), which derives from the local pattern of forest, agriculture and other land cover types.

In the long run, this support should result in a decrease in the need for expensive high-technology, acute-care interventions.

12755,"Pipeline replacement ‘on line’ has been practised for many years using pipe bursting technologies, which typically involve multiple fracture and outward displacement of fragments of the existing pipeline using either pneumatic or hydraulic means. One of the most important considerations for the design of a pipe bursting operation is the pattern of ground displacement caused, and consequently the possible damage to existing adjacent services and structures.

It must understand where it is safe to drive, and be able to recognize static and moving objects. It must also be able to relate this understanding to the desired route plan, so that progress may be made in the most sensible way. This paper describes an attempt to bridge the large gap between making sparse three-dimensional measurements of static scene structure, and achieving a useful level of understanding of that structure. In particular, it addresses the need to know where in the scene it is safe to drive.

Within PDGFA lies a complex minisatellite structure that results in partial duplications of exon 4 and the IVS4 splice donor site. Here, we show that the PDGFA genes of four ape species and an Old-World monkey all have similar complex minisatellites at this position. Comparison of their structures suggests evolutionary constraints resulting from the protein-coding function of the minisatellite. Nonetheless, the IVS4 minisatellite seems to have undergone independent expansion events in different primate lineages. Within the human IVS4 minisatellite, an embedded pentanucleotide repeat, based on the sequence (CCTCC)n, shows frequent subunit sequence variation but only rare length polymorphism.

12792,"Design of a propeller for Florida Atlantic University's Ocean Explorer (OEX) series autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is presented. The primary requirement of the design is that the vehicle achieve a steady forward speed of 5 knots using a direct-drive motor limited by a torque of 4 Nm at 1000 rpm. The thrust required to propel the vehicle at steady 5 knots was estimated to be /spl ap/100 N. The estimation takes into account, empirically, the effects of hull-propeller interactions on flow into the propeller and vehicle drag. While an elaborate hydrodynamics analysis is envisaged for the design of AUV propellers in the future, a blade element method is used in the present design.

The participants represent a diverse cross-section of the aerospace sector, NASA, and academia. Over the last two decades, there has been wide interest in developing a high altitude, stratospheric lighter-than-air (LTA) airship that could maneuver and remain in a desired geographic position (ie,"" station-keeping"") for weeks, months or even years. Our study found considerable scientific value in both low altitude (< 40 kft) and high altitude (> 60 kft) airships across a wide spectrum of space, atmospheric, and Earth science programs. Over the course of the study period, we identified stratospheric tethered aerostats as a viable alternative to airships where station-keeping was valued over maneuverability.

This system can be further integrated with a novel design of heat pipe to heat or cool the building. The work contains several aspects related to the use of light pipes and stack ventilation. A study of the statistical information on the main building types and their morphology in several European countries has helped determine the most suitable regions for this technology. The most potential building types are educational, office, and retail buildings. In order to enhance the natural stack ventilation and to prevent reverse flow, a wind terminal is installed on the top of the light-vent pipe.

12845,"The extraction of fifteen (15) polymer additives with supercritical carbon dioxide which are used as antioxidants, uv stabilizers, process lubes, flame retardants and antistats from eight formulations of polystyrene is demonstrated and compared to traditional dissolution/precipitation extractions.  The purpose of the study was twofold:  1)  the development of a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method(s) for the additives and 2)  the determination of the viability of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) for the additives from polystyrene.  Separation of some of the additives was achieved using reversed phase liquid chromatography.  Nine of the additives were assayed in this manner while, the remaining six additives could not be assayed using reversed phase liquid chromatography.  In order to develop an extraction method for the additives, the effects of static extraction time, CO2 density, and temperature were first investigated.  These preliminary extractions revealed that a static extraction period which afforded an opportunity for the polymer to swell combined with a high CO2 density and extraction temperature above the glass transition (Tg) yielded quantitative recoveries of the additives.

This can help to localise changes, and hence make a contribution to coping with the problem of altering systems in response to change. We investigate an alternative approach, using concepts from distributed artificial intelligence. We assume that software components do not have to have rigid interfaces; they can negotiate, make decisions, etc. The role of the maintainer is changed; we shift part of the responsibility for decision-making etc. onto the software itself using concepts from adaptive and self-modifying systems.

12850,"This case study of a low-achieving first grader learning to subtract two-digit quantities with several different pedagogical objects demonstrates the complexities of the conceptual shift from the tens part of a number to the ones part. Perseverations (failures to shift) occurred with the quantities, the count words, and the number in the tens or ones position. These difficulties reappeared in each new context and in a previously successful context. Over sessions, overcoming them gradually required less help from the first-grade tutor and the supporting adult tutor. Conceptual structures required for and a component analysis of two-digit subtraction are described. The range and nature of the learning difficulties described indicate the complexity of the learning task facing children, especially those speaking European languages. The success of the firstgrade tutors indicates that classmates can be taught to provide excellent learning support.Multi-digit subtraction is considerably more difficult than multi-digit addition, and many second-and third-graders in the United States and Europe do not carry it out correctly (Bednarz & Janvier, 1992; Beishuizen, 1993; Fuson, 1990, 1992a, 1992b).

12917,"Home to the so-called big five publishers as well as hundreds of smaller presses, renowned literary agents, a vigorous arts scene, and an uncountable number of aspiring and established writers alike, New York City is widely perceived as the publishing capital of the United States and the world. This book traces the origins and early evolution of the city’s rise to literary preeminence. Through five case studies, Steven Carl Smith examines publishing in New York from the post–Revolutionary War period through the Jacksonian era. He discusses the gradual development of local, regional, and national distribution networks, assesses the economic relationships and shared social and cultural practices that connected printers, booksellers, and their customers, and explores the uncharacteristically modern approaches taken by the city’s preindustrial printers and distributors. If the cultural matrix of printed texts served as the primary legitimating vehicle for political debate and literary expression, Smith argues, then deeper understanding of the economic interests and political affiliations of the people who produced these texts gives necessary insight into the emergence of a major American industry. Those involved in New York’s book trade imagined for themselves, like their counterparts in other major seaport cities, a robust business that could satisfy the new nation’s desire for print, and many fulfilled their ambition by cultivating networks that crossed regional boundaries, delivering books to the masses.

English is widely taught in Cuba in the education system and on television by Cuban teachers who are prepared in five-year courses at pedagogical universities by bilingual Cuban teacher educators.  This case study explores the identity and pedagogy of six English language teacher educators at Cuba’s largest university of pedagogical sciences. Postcolonial theory provides a framework for examining how the Cuban pedagogy of English language teacher education resists the negative representation of Cuba in hegemonic Western discourse; and challenges neoliberal Western dogma. Postcolonial concepts of representation, resistance and hybridity are used in this examination.  Cuban teacher education features a distinctive ‘pedagogy of tenderness’. Teacher educators build on caring relationships and institutionalised values of solidarity, collectivism and collaboration. Communicative English language teaching strategies are contextualised to enhance the pedagogical and communicative competence of student teachers, and intercultural intelligibility is emphasised.

12931,"“Care” in relationships between disabled and nondisabled partners is typically constructed as a binary between care-givers and care-receivers. In other words, the disabled partner is represented as only a care-receiver and the nondisabled partner as only a care-giver. This dependency dynamic desexualizes nondisabled/disabled relationships because the care burden is expected to interfere with sexual intimacy. This image of care and sexuality between disabled/nondisabled partners can be found in a variety of fields and discourses that touch the lives of people with disabilities and their partners. For example, in the applied fields (eg, rehabilitation, medicine, counseling) the assumption that nondisabled partners experience only burden is frequently built into research designs and it is rare for such studies to even measure sexual and marital satisfaction or positive aspects of caregiving. Similarly, contemporary feminist research constructs nondisabled partners as victims of a system that refuses to help caregivers, statistically female. It is true that family caregivers need help, but it is symptomatic of our beliefs about disability in intimate relationships that the disabled partners are erased in much feminist care research. Even in the disability rights movement, care is often downplayed because, in a culture that views care so negatively, it is only a liability to draw attention to personal care needs. Disability rights advocates prefer to emphasize the similarities between disabled and nondisabled people. Thus, contemporary feminist research, the applied fields, popular culture and the disability rights movement—all relatively disparate discourses …",Sarah Anne Smith,5,10359071849396695617,,,,,"Love, sex, and disability: The ethics and politics of care in intimate relationships",http://rave.ohiolink.edu/etdc/view?acc_num=osu1246649418,,2009,/scholar?cites=10359071849396695617,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:h0mLeC6b6wcC

We examined the characteristics and outcomes of women and men undergoing PCI over the past decade. Methods: In this analysis, we studied 18,039 patients undergoing PCI at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation from 1992 to 2002. Mean follow-up duration was 4.8 years. Results: Twenty-nine percent (n= 5301) of the patients were female. Compared to the cohort of males, the female cohort was older (mean age 67 vs. 62 years) and had a greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus (34% vs. 24%), hypertension (71% vs. 58%), and peripheral vascular disease (9% vs. 7%); all p< 0.0001.

12946,"Warnings may be presented in several ways, the norm being via the visual or auditory modalities. The primary purpose of a warning is to alert and inform (Edworthy & Stanton, 1995; Wheale, 1981), as well as to guide the response. For a warning to be effective the signal used should be recognisable as a warning and the operator must be aware of both what the signal represents and the action that is required. Within the modern military cockpit, the visual channel is often overloaded, and auditory warnings provide a method to alleviate this. Due to the unique nature of the auditory system, auditory warnings can attract attention regardless of either the operator’s head/eye position, or what task they are engaged in. In this way, our sense of hearing acts as a natural warning sense (Edworthy & Stanton, 1999). Auditory warnings may be either verbal or nonverbal. Both have their relative advantages and disadvantages, which can be used as a guide for effective implementation.

12975,"Resistance to chloramphenicol in M. pyogenes is accompanied by 1) high endogenous respiration, 2) loss of ability to oxidize pyruvate and acetate, and 3) increased formation of lactic acid from glucose. The antibiotic exerts no depressant effect on any of these reactions carried out by a strain sensitive to the drug. Attempts to reconstitute the pyruvate oxidase system of intact cells resistant to the antibiotic have been unsuccessful.",JL Padron and SC Smith and HH Ramsey,5,12689031119622365455,Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine,2,477-478,SAGE Publications,Chloramphenicol resistance in Micrococcus pyogenes.

12979,"Overheating in buildings is one of the increasing concerns related to climate change and can lead to an increase in heat-related health issues and higher energy consumption due to the use of air conditioning systems. Literature shows that internal conditions and demand on environmental control systems can vary with height within buildings. However, an architectural trend towards highly glazed façades for tall buildings suggests the vertical gradient of performance is not always considered in the design process. By simulating a high-rise residential building in London, a comparative analysis of the overheating risks and daylighting at different levels in the building was conducted. In this study the model was able to consider the influence of surrounding built environment on solar gain and so influence of urban location on overheating risk was taken into account. Simulations were conducted using typical reference …",Leonardo Habitzreuter and Stefan Thor Smith and Trevor Keeling,4,1590983271452109969,Indoor and Built Environment,5,671-688,SAGE Publications,Modelling the overheating risk in an uniform high-rise building design with a consideration of urban context and heatwaves,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1420326X19856400,29,2020,/scholar?cites=1590983271452109969,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:4oLgDUE9yTUC
12980,"Prior to the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), donor-derived hepatitis C (dd-HCV) viremia predicted poor post-heart transplant (HT) outcomes, including a higher risk of coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and death. Considering the success of DAAs to treat HCV and the shortage of organs for HT, we institutionalized a clinical protocol of using HCV+ donors. Using intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS) in patients acquiring post-HT HCV infection, we examined the risk of CAV in the current era.Between September 1st 2016 and October 2nd 2018, 54 HCV-naive patients and 1 with a history of treated-HCV pre-transplant, underwent HT from HCV-positive donors (follow-up available through October 10th, 2018).

12982,"It has been a long-standing belief that exposure to media depictions of crime can influence fear of crime victimization through cultivation. However, previous research on the topic has been mixed. These issues were investigated in a sample of 3,003 adults in Trinidad. The impact of fictional media, news media, and reality TV as well as perceived crime risk were examined related to perceived fears of crime. Only perceived risk of crime victimization was related to fear of crime. No media variables predicted fear of crime.
