5000,"Since the emergence of large aspect ratio and multifunctional conductive fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoplates, etc., conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have attracted increasing attention. Although the morphological control of conductive networks in CPCs has been extensively investigated as an important issue for the preparation of high performance CPCs, recent extensive progress has not been systematically addressed in any review. It has been observed that the morphological control of conductive networks during the preparation of CPCs has crucial influence on the electrical properties of these composites. Several methods have been shown to be able to control the network structure, and thus, tune the electrical properties of CPCs, including the use of shear, polymer blends, thermal annealing, mixed filler, latex particle etc. Moreover, many novel and exciting applications have been …",Hua Deng and Lin Lin and Mizhi Ji and Shuangmei Zhang and Mingbo Yang and Qiang Fu,414,5222006117865495393,,4,627-655,Pergamon,Progress on the morphological control of conductive network in conductive polymer composites and the use as electroactive multifunctional materials,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079670013000877,39,2014

5006,"Polymer/filler composites have been widely used in various areas. One of the keys to achieve the high performance of these composites is good interfacial interaction between polymer matrix and filler. As a relatively new approach, the possibility to enhance polymer/filler interfacial interaction via crystallization of polymer on the surface of fillers, i.e., interfacial crystallization, is summarized and discussed in this paper. Interfacial crystallization has attracted tremendous interest in the past several decades, and some unique hybrid crystalline structures have been observed, including hybrid shish–kebab and hybrid shish–calabash structures in which the filler served as the shish and crystalline polymer as the kebab/calabash. Thus, the manipulation of the interfacial crystallization architecture offers a potential highly effective route to achieve strong polymer/filler interaction.

5007,"It is widely believed that the trigonal β-form is favorable and effective for toughening isotactic polypropylene (iPP). Therefore, β-form content should be achieved as high as possible to realize excellent toughness in iPP. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the connection between crystallites might mainly determine the toughness of iPP instead of the β-crystal content. A new rare earth nucleator (WBG) was used to generate the rich β-crystalline structure in the compression-molded bars that were fabricated upon different molten temperatures (Tf). Interestingly, the increase in tensile elongation can be as large as 8 times for increased Tf. The polymorphic composition and overall crystallinity of β-nucleated iPP are almost independent of Tf.

In this work, a core–shell structured hybrid (SiO2–GO) was prepared and introduced into an epoxy polymer matrix as a new filler. The incorporation of the hybrid optimized the modulus, strength and fracture toughness of the composites simultaneously. The ultrathin GO shells coated on silica surfaces were regarded as the main reason for the enhancement. Located at the silica-epoxy interface, GO served as an unconventional coupling agent of the silica filler, which effectively enhanced the interfacial interaction of the epoxy/SiO2–GO composites, and thus greatly improved the mechanical properties of the epoxy resin.

The main issue with polymer electrolytes is their lower ionic conductivity compared to that of liquid electrolytes. Nanoscale fillers such as silica and alumina nanoparticles are known to enhance the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes. Although carbon nanotubes have been used as fillers for polymers in various applications, they have not yet been used in polymer electrolytes as they are conductive and can pose the risk of electrical shorting.

Due to the strong hydrogen bonding interaction between PVA and GO, some additional physically cross-linked points could be formed in PVA, which largely improved shape memory properties of PVA. Solvent-induced shape memory behavior was observed by immersing PVA/GO nanocomposites in water. The water-induced shape recovery was due to the decrease of glass transition temperature and storage modulus. This could be explained by the swelling plasticizing effect of water on PVA, as indicated by the obvious expansion in volume of PVA. On the other hand, the weakened hydrogen bonding between PVA and GO was also observed after immersing the PVA/GO nanocomposites in water.

This could be understood as due to the formation of much jammed fillers network with 1D CNTs and 2D clay platelets combined together, as indicated by rheological measurement.

It was found that the notched Izod impact strength (S) of HDPE / CaCO3 blends depends discontinuously on CaCO3 particle concentration. A brittle‐ductile transition occurs when the CaCO3 volume fraction (Vf) increases to a critical value (Vηf). Furthermore, a brittle‐ductile transition master curve can be constructed by taking the matrix ligament thickness (L) into account as a parameter instead of Vf. The results show that the critical matrix ligament thickness (Lc) is a single parameter for the transition and Lc = 5.2μm for HDPE / CaCO3 blends.

Stereocomplexation between enantiomeric poly(l‐lactide) (PLLA) and poly(d‐lactide) (PDLA) opens a new avenue toward PLA‐based engineering plastics with improved properties. The formation, crystal structure, properties, and potential applications of stereocomplex‐type PLA (SC‐PLA) are summarized by some research groups. However, since it is challenging to achieve full stereocomplexation from high‐molecular‐weight PLLA/PDLA blends …",Hongwei Bai and Shihao Deng and Dongyu Bai and Qin Zhang and Qiang Fu,59,13184289844056652466,Macromolecular Rapid Communications,23,1700454,,Recent Advances in Processing of Stereocomplex‐Type Polylactide,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/marc.201700454,38,2017

The large-area graphene oxide (LGO) sheets are expected to overlap better with each other and form the continuous GO network in PVA matrix than small-area graphene oxide (SGO). During the thermal reduction process, the LGO sheets are easily restored and improve the electrical conductivity of nanocomposites due to their low damage level of conjugate-structure. As a result, the percolation threshold of PVA/LrGO nanocomposites is~ 0.189 wt% lower than present reports (0.5~ 0.7 wt%). At the LrGO content of 0.7 wt%, the electrical conductivity of PVA/LrGO nanocomposites reaches 6.3· 10–3 S/m.

5152,"In this paper, we report a unique method to develop polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composites with high dielectric constant and low loss tangent by loading relatively low content of graphene-encapsulated barium titanate (BT) hybrid fillers. BT particles encapsulated with graphene oxide (BT-GO) were prepared via electrostatic self-assembly and subsequent chemical reduction resulted in BT-RGO particles. SEM morphology revealed that RGO sheets were segregated by BT particles. The hybrid fillers have two advantages for tuning dielectric properties: loading extremely low content of RGO can be exactly controlled and individual RGO sheets segregated by BT particles would prevent leakage current. As a result, PVDF composites filled with BT-RGO displayed improved dielectric properties before percolative behavior occurred.

To exploit the dual functionality, poly(D-lactide) grafted ethylene–acrylic ester copolymer (EMA-g-PDLA) capable of collaborating with the PLLA matrix to form the sc crystallites was first prepared via melt coupling reaction between end groups (carboxyl and hydroxyl) of PDLA and excess epoxy group of EMA–glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (EMA–GMA). During subsequent melt-blending of PLLA with the prepared EMA-g-PDLA, sc crystallites are formed at the interface.

A remarkable increase of tensile strength of the PVA/gelatin fibers was achieved by adding small amount of CNT. The mechanism of reinforcement has been studied using a combination of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 2D wide‐angle X‐ray diffraction (2D‐WAXD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM showed a decreased gelatin domain size by adding CNTs, suggesting a possible compatibilization effect between PVA and gelatin. On the other hand, an increased crystallinity and degree of orientation of PVA/gelatin fibers has been observed by adding CNTs.

Meanwhile, the tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the composites could be maintained. Various characterizations were used to understand the microstructure changes and toughening mechanism after β-modification and annealing.

The role and importance of processing were also discussed recently. However, few papers concerning the correlation between morphology of MMT and mechanical properties were published. In order to understand the tensile behavior of PP/Montmorillonite(MMT) nanocomposites better, and to further improve the reinforcement efficiency, we first prepared the PP nanocomposites via direct melt intercalation using conventional twin-screw extrusion. The dispersion and tensile property of the composites were then investigated by SEM, XRD, TEM and a video-controlled tensile set-up. The macroscopic and microscopic dispersion of MMT in PP matrix was verified by XRD and TEM, combined with SEM. The tensile properties were obtained by video-controlled tensile set-up, which gives true stress-strain curve. It was found that a partly intercalated and partly exfoliated structure (also called incomplete exfoliation) existed in the system. Though the tensile strength of PPnanocomposites is not much improved in engineering stress-strain curves, more than 20% increase of true stress was found ina true stress-strain experiment at high true strain, which indicates that only oriented silicate layers can have a big effect ontensile properties.

That is, a Zn layer upon Ni foam substrate is prepared by pulse electrodeposition, then the ZnO nanoneedle/NiO heterostructural composite is obtained via thermal oxidation, and at last, the composite is modified with the dispersively deposited Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) by ion sputtering. The surface plasmon resonance effect of the Au NPs significantly enhances the light absorption. Meanwhile, the Au NPs form a Schottky barrier with ZnO nanoneedles and further inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In addition, due to the nonsolvent conditions, the introduction of impurities is avoided, and thus it shows strong photocatalytic stability.

In this way, the interaction among glass fiber, elastomer and annealing could be discussed based on various characterizations, and their combined effect on mechanical properties of the composites could be determined.

It was observed that TiO2 nanoparticels are selectively located at the interface between PU dispersed phase and PLA matrix to form a so called soft core-rigid shell structure. Interestingly, the addition of PU gives a significant rise to not only toughness, but also UV-resistance of PLA/TiO2 composites.

By comparing with the PVDF/clay and PVDF/DDAC modified-clay systems, it is demonstrated that it is DDAC that induces polar β and γ forms of PVDF rather than organoclay itself. The widely accepted mechanism that crystal lattice matching between PVDF and clay induces β form in PVDF/organoclay composite might be wrong.

To obtain a good dispersion of PCL in the PLLA matrix, blends were prepared via a solution‐coagulation method. An increase in extensibility of PLLA of more than 20 times was observed on adding only 10 wt% of PCL, accompanied by a slight decrease in tensile strength. However, annealing of the samples led to a sharp decrease of extensibility due to phase separation and a change of crystalline structure.

During hydrothermal reaction, NBT aggregates are dispersed on the petals of in-situ grown Ni(OH)2 crystals as small aggregates. The three-dimensional structure of Ni(OH)2 can act as physical barrier to prohibit secondary agglomeration in PVDF to allow rather uniform NBT dispersion.

This leads to a time delay when vaccinated hosts change to susceptible hosts. On the other hand, the worm infection is usually a nonlinear process. Considering the actual situation, a variable infection rate is introduced to describe the spread process of worms. According to above aspects, we propose a time-delayed worm propagation model with variable infection rate. Then the existence condition and the stability of the positive equilibrium are derived. Due to the existence of time delay, the worm propagation system may be unstable and out of control. Moreover, the threshold  of Hopf bifurcation is obtained. The worm propagation system is stable if time delay is less than . When time delay is over , the system will be unstable. In addition, numerical experiments have been performed, which can match the conclusions we deduce.

The results reveal that the incorporation of only 1 wt % PDLA can facilitate the formation of CB network in PLLA/CB nanocomposites because SC crystallites induced enhancement in the melt viscosity of PLLA matrix could depress CB aggregation, finally leading to an evident decease in the electrical percolation threshold (φc).

5520,"In this work, completely immiscible polyethylene/polyamide12 (PE/PA12) blends were prepared by high shear extruder. The morphology and mechanical properties of the blends were investigated as a function of rotation speed. It was found that the high shear processing is an effective method to improve the dispersion of the PA12 phase in PE matrix when PA12 contents are 5 wt% and 10 wt%, and the dispersed phase particle size is reduced with the increase of rotation speed from 100 r/min to 500 r/min. However, with further increase of PA12 content to 20 wt%, high shear processing has no effect on the phase morphology of the blends. Accordingly, a largely increased elongation at break and impact strength are observed for PE/PA12/95/5 and PE/PA12/90/10 blends obtained at high rotation speeds but no effect on the property of PE/PA12/80/20.

5566,"The improvement of mechanical properties of high\| density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP) blends was studied by controlling the phase compatibility versus phase separation. In the original injection molding processes, super mechanical properties of blend specimens have not been got easily. Researches have been carried out in injection molding with high shear injection conditions. It has been pointed out that the compatibility of blends will increase under the strong shear in injection processes due to the raise of LCST curve. After the melt is injected into the cold mold, its temperature and compatibility decrease simultaneously, phase separation takes place and becomes frozen in the specimen. High mechanical properties will be got when the phase separation develope to some extent, but it is difficult to control the phase compatibility and separation. The special method of oscillating packing injection molding under low pressure provides a condition to control the phase separation degree. Because the phase morphology and crystal morphology of HDPE/PP blends compete with each other, it is difficult to control the micro\| phase separation. In this paper, the fine struture combined with the micro\| phase separation and orientation were controlled by using that special injection method and high strength and high toughness blends were obtained.

Previous methods often rely on the thermal or microwave, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) expansion to overcome the large diffusion resistance.

Here, we discovered that adding ammonium persulfate ((NH4)2S2O8) to concentrated sulfuric acid as gas expansion agent for the pretreatment of graphite flakes can lead the graphite to form a porous structure and effectively improve the specific surface area of graphite, providing more contact area for graphite with oxidizing agents due to the rapid gas release.

In this paper, for the first time, we propose a propagation model to explore the spread behavior of PLC-PC worms across the PLC-PC coupled network. Theoretical analysis of the model shows the disease-free and endemic equilibriums of the network with defensive measures. And the stability of the model is examined by an epidemic threshold value. Several numerical and simulation experiments are presented to illustrate the analysis.

The phase structures and phase behaviors of these molecular Janus particles were studied by DSC, POM, FT-IR, and WAXD experiments. It was found that introducing one hydroxyl alkyl group leads to a decreased crystal melting point, and incorporating two hydroxyl alkyl groups at different POSS positions causes the formation of lamellar liquid crystal mesophases with feature sizes and transition temperatures that depend on the symmetry of these regioisomers.

5641,"The energy density of a film capacitor is proportional to the square of the breakdown strength (BDS) of the material. However, polymer composites’ BDS is usually compromised by the filler’s agglomeration, thus resulting in very limited increase in the energy density. In this work, we adopted a high-shear extrusion technique to improve filler’s dispersion. A synergistic effect between montmorillonite (oMMT) and boron nitride (BN) on BDS of polypropylene was observed, particularly for samples prepared by high shear extrusion.

Taking advantage of the formation of stereocomplex (SC) crystallites between poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), we propose a facile strategy to prepare PLA microspheres with tunable morphology and crystalline structure by compounding PLLA and PDLA.

Correspondingly, the morphology of the microspheres were varied (smooth, porous, golf-ball like, guava like) and higher crystallinity of SC-PLA would lead to a more coarse and porous structure.

However, the effects of these two steps on the exfoliation capability and chemical structure of graphite oxide remain unclear. In this study, both the functional group content of graphite oxide and the entire evolution of interlayer spacing were investigated during the two steps. Step I oxidation is a slowly inhomogeneous oxidation step to remove unoxidized graphite flakes. The prepared graphite oxide can be easily self-exfoliated but contains a lot of organic sulfur.

5698,"In this paper, a flexible Ag/CNTs-PDMS (polydimethylsi-loxane) composite film sensor based on the novel design philosophy was prepared. Its force-electric effect mechanism is based on the generation of micro-cracks in the Ag film during external forcing, leading to resistance variation. Experimental results find that Ag film thickness has a strong influence on the sensor’s sensitivity, which exhibits a tendency of first increasing and then decreasing the Ag film thickness, and also has an optimal thickness of 4.9 μm for the maximum sensitivity around 30. The sensitive mechanism can be theoretically explained by using the quantum tunneling effect. Due to the use of the wrinkled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film, this sensor has advantages, such as high sensitivity, large strain range, good stability and durability, cheap price, and suitability for large-scale production. Preliminary applications on human-body monitoring reveal that the sensor can detect weak tremors and breathe depth and rate, and the corresponding heartbeat response. It provides possibilities to diagnose early Parkinson’s disease and exploit an early warning system for sudden infant death syndrome and sleep apnea in adults.

Consequently, these polymers have attracted considerable interest. However, the mechanical properties of fluorinated polyurethanes usually decline with increasing fluorine contents. The blending of fluorinated polyurethanes with normal polyurethane was carried out to achieve balanced mechanical and surface properties. It was found that polyurethane with good mechanical properties and low surface energy can be obtained by adding a small amount of fluorinated polyurethane. The fluorinated side chains can easily migrate to uppermost surfaces of the blends untill the fluorine level at the surface becomes almost saturated. It has been shown from contact angle, XPS and AFM measurements that only as little as 0.34 wt% of fluorine level is enough to produce a surface saturated with fluorine, and the fluorine level at the uppermost surface is one hundred times higher than that in the blend bulk.

The effect ofclay dispersion on the crystallization and morphology of PP was investigated via PLM, SAXS and DSC. Experimental results show that exfoliated clay layers are much more efficient than intercalated clay and agglomerates of clay in serving as nucleation agent due to the nano-scale dispersion of clay, resulting in a dramatic decrease in crystal size (lamellar thickness and spherulites) and an increase of crystallization temperature and crystallization rate. On the other hand, a decrease of melting temperature and crystallinity was also observed in PP/clay composites with exfoliated dispersion, due to the strong interaction between PP and clay.

However, the crystalline behavior of low molecular weight branched polyethylene is the same as that of high molecular weight linear polyethylene, but different with that of low molecular weigh linear polyethylene.

The main characteristics of this change include: (a) the outlines of α‐row nuclei layer correspond to wave‐like, saw‐like, and straight lines; (b) the orientation level of iPP molecules in the α‐row nuclei layer become higher; (c) the α‐lamellae rearrange from loose to compact; and (d) the distance between the growth sites of β‐sectors and the …",Jing Zhao and Jihai Zhang and Mengfan Jing and Guopeng Sui and Dingyao Liu and Ke Wang and Qiang Fu,4,8478708491462053026,Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics,7,368-377,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Correlations between microstructure of α‐row nuclei and polymorphism of shear‐induced iPP/carbon fiber cylindrite,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/polb.24790,57,2019

However, due to the poor mechanical strength and weak adhesion between coating and substrate, the superhydrophobicity of the coating is easily lost under mechanical loads. In this study, a facile approach was proposed to build a mechanically stable superhydrophobic poly(chloro-p-xylylene) (PPXC) film by pre-coating a polydimethylsiloxane adhesive layer (PDMS AL) on the original PPXC film and coating a superhydrophobic PDMS and silica (PDMS/SiO2) layer on the PDMS AL layer. As demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, the thermal cross-linking reaction between the PDMS/SiO2 coating and the PDMS AL layer could dramatically promote the interaction between the PDMS/SiO2 coating and the PPXC film.

In the process, poly(l‐lactic acid) (PLA) is chosen as the polymer matrix and poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) is chosen as a carrier polymer for CNTs and an interfacial compatilizer for segregated PLA domains. Thanks to the random distribution of CNTs in coating layer and the formation of macroscopic segregated CNTs network, the percolation threshold is reduced to be as low as 0.026 vol%. So far as we know, this is the lowest percolation threshold that can be obtained in segregated conductive polymer composites (CPCs) with pristine CNTs as conductive fillers.

5764," Crystallization in polymer systems actually is a process that transfers the entangled melts into a semi-crystalline layered structure. Whether or not a chain disentangles may result in different crystallization mechanism. When compared to the crystal thickness (dc), the volume occupied by the chain in the melt, i.e., the radius of gyration (Rg), plays a very important role in polymer crystallization. When dc ≤ Rg, crystallization does not necessitate a chain disentangling. The entanglements are just shifted into the amorphous regions. However, as dc>Rg, i.e., as the crystal thickness gets larger than the radius of gyration of the chain in the melt, it becomes necessary for a chain to disentangle. Then a change of crystallization mechanism occurs. Such change has been experimentally observed in the crystallization of poly(1-butene). A change in the crystal morphologies from spherulite to quadrangle, is seen via PLM, as crystallization temperatures increase.Even more, such a change is molecular weight dependent, and shifts to lower temperature as molecular weight decreases.

The two fractions show a growth rate change at an undercooling of 17°C (at 117°C and 120°C, respectively, for these two fractions), which may be identified as the regime I/II transition. This transition does not correspond to a single-crystal morphological change from a truncated lozenge with curved (200) and (110) planes to a lenticular crystal as proposed previously.

Methods According to the solubility of drugs in supercritical fluid, the preparation methods were classified and reviewed on the basis of published literatures. Results Supercritical fluid possessed the advantages of both the gas and the liquid, such as great solubility, favorable mass transfer capacity, and satisfactory permeability. Subtle changes in temperature or pressure could cause marked variation of solubility nearby the critical point. Carbon dioxide was the most frequently used supercritical fluid. According to the solubility of the drug in supercritical fluid, the preparation techniques could be classified into two categorizations: the solvent process and the antisolvent process, with rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) and supercritical antisolvent process (SAS) as the typical methods, respectively. Aggregation of the nanoparticles was the shortage for the two methods in common. But the recently developed RESS with solid cosolvent (RESS-SC), RESS into aqueous solution (RESS-AS) and SAS with enhanced mass transfer (SAS-EM) could overcome this problem.

5843," Metallocene-catalyzed short chain branched polyethylene (SCBPE) was blended with LDPE, HDPE, PS, EPDM and iPP in the weight proportions of 80 and 20. The crystallization and mechanical properties of these blends were studied by PLM, DSC and DMA. It has been observed in PLM that SCBPE/LDPE, SCBPE/HDPE and SCBPE/EPDM can form band spherulites whose band width and size are both smaller than that of the pure SCBPE. Tiny crystallites are observed in the completely immiscible SCBPE/PS blend. The crystallites in SCBPE/iPP are very small and only irregular spherulites are seen. The crystallization kinetics and mechanical properties of SCBPE are greatly affected by the second polyolefin, but in a different way, depending on the phase behavior and the modulus of the second components. SCBPE may be phase miscible in the melt with HDPE, LDPE and EPDM and co-crystallize together with HDPE or LDPE during cooling. A big change of crystal morphology and crystallization kinetics is seen in SCBPE/iPP blend compared with pure SCBPE and the lowest tanδ is also seen for this system.

5869,"Hydrophobically associated (HA) hydrogels have attracted great concerns with their admirable properties, such as self-healing and shape memory. However, a few works have been devoted to apply HA hydrogels in practice, especially in wastewater treatment. This may be because of the non-ionic monomer composition and the poor mechanical properties after swelling. In this work, in order to improve the mechanical properties and absorption behavior of HA polyacrylamide (HPAM) hydrogel, hydrophobically associated polyacrylamide/cellulose nanofiber (HPAMF) composite hydrogels were prepared. It was found that by incorporating CNF (2 wt%), the tensile strength (≈ 0.276 MPa) was largely increased by 632% compared to HPAM hydrogels. The maximum Cu ion adsorption capacity of the HPAMF hydrogel (containing 2 wt% CNF) was 2.33 mmol g− 1, about 86% over the HPAM hydrogel.

5870,"The reservoir area dependent thermal transport at nanoscale two-dimensional and one-dimensional interfaces is investigated by the non-equilibrium Green's function method. For the two-dimensional nanoscale interface composed of graphene sheets, the reservoir area is identical to the contact area S at the interface. As S increases from few atoms, the interfacial thermal conductance σ per S (Λ = σ/S) is negatively dependent on S due to the decrease of phonon transmission per S. With S increasing to several square nanometers, Λ converges to a constant value. However, for the one-dimensional nanoscale interface composed of nested carbon nanotubes (NCNTs), it is σ instead of Λ that converges to a constant value because the reservoir in one-dimensional nanoscale NCNTs has a fixed area, which can only provide finite transport channels.

Methods 155 CVA patients have been observed for 2 years and the results of bronchial methacholine chloride provocation test before and after the observation were analyzed. Results 30% of the patients werent analyzed because they did not take the drugs regularly. The result showed that the CVA male vs female was 1∶ 4, the average age was (40? 7.2) years. 20 patients developed typical asthma (12.94%). After 2 years, 70% of the patients had positive results of the bronchial methacholine chloride provocation. Methacholine chloride concentration was negatively related to hyperresponsiveness of bronchus. FEV_1% was negatively related to the state of asthmatic degree. Conclusions The CVA was incident to the young and the middle-age females, often with an obvious inducement. The female prognosis was worse than that of the male. Generally speaking, the prognosis was good if patients took medicine regularly. Patientscompliance was the essence of the prevention and the cure. Young females who had chronic cough indicate CVA. The concentration of methacholine chloride and FEV_1% were effective indexes when we estimated the state and prognosis of CVA.

The study of stepped hoop shear field on the isotactic polypropylene (iPP) pipe was developed through applying a self-designed rotational shear system (RSS). The effect of stepped shear field on the microstructure and comprehensive properties of iPP pipe was investigated by the comparison with continuous shear. It could be found that the loosely-assembled shish-kebabs with the larger size were formed in the continuous shear pipes, but the smaller and tightly-stacked ones existed in the pipes with stepped shear.

Specifically, when the d-spacing between nanosheets is greater than 14.0 nm, the dried rGO nanosheets can be well redispersed and stabilized in various organic solvents.

5943,"Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) have exceptional gas separation performance for a broad range of applications. However, PIMs are highly susceptible to physical aging, which drastically reduces their long-term performance over time. In this work, we leverage complementary experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies to decipher the inter-/intrachain changes that occur during aging of the prototypical PIM-1 and its rigidified analogue PIM-C1. By elucidating this hereto unexplored aging behavior, we reveal that the dramatic decrease in gas permeability of PIM materials during aging stems from a loss of fractional free volume (FFV) due to PIM chain relaxations induced by π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, or van der Waals’ forces. While the PIM-1 based membranes displayed enhanced gas pair selectivities after aging, the PIM-C1 based membranes showed an opposite trend with …",Min Liu and Xinxin Lu and Mitchell D Nothling and Cara M Doherty and Lianhai Zu and Judy N Hart and Paul A Webley and Jianyong Jin and Qiang Fu and Greg G Qiao,0,,ACS Materials Letters,8,993-998,American Chemical Society,Physical Aging Investigations of a Spirobisindane-Locked Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.0c00184,2,2020
5944,"Graphene is a kind of two-dimensional lamellar nano-material with excellent barrier property, and it has important application in the field of anticorrosive coatings. The effect of graphene addition on the corrosion resistance of zinc-rich epoxy coating and glass flake epoxy coating was investigated by opencircuit potential (Eocp), AC impedance and corrosion morphology. The results showed that the radius of arc resistance of epoxy zinc-rich coating with graphene was smaller than that of epoxy zincrich coating without graphene. The arc resistance with epoxy glass flake coating decreased gradually in 528h. It showed from the corrosion morphology observation that the addition of graphene improved the corrosion resistance of the zinc-rich coating, but reduced the corrosion resistance of the epoxy glass flake coating.",Shuai Wang and Rui Ding and Xiaodong Zhao and Qiang Fu and Hao Sun and Shuyue Chen and Zhongyi An and Yan Li and Xinlei Qu,0,,Int.
