16000,"This article considers the role of the hippocampus in memory function. A central thesis is that work with rats, monkeys, and humans—which has sometimes seemed to proceed independently in 3 separate literatures—is now largely in agreement about the function of the hippocampus and related structures. A biological perspective is presented, which proposes multiple memory systems with different functions and distinct anatomical organizations. The hippocampus (together with anatomically related structures) is essential for a specific kind of memory, here termed declarative memory (similar terms include explicit and relational). Declarative memory is contrasted with a heterogeneous collection of nondeclarative (implicit) memory abilities that do not require the hippocampus (skills and habits, simple conditioning, and the phenomenon of priming). The hippocampus is needed temporarily to bind together distributed …",Larry R Squire,6558,11106234551712909050,Psychological review,2,195,American Psychological Association,"Memory and the hippocampus: a synthesis from findings with rats, monkeys, and humans.",https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.99.2.195,99,1992,/scholar?cites=11106234551712909050,Un_yatgAAAAJ:j5aT6aphRxQC
16001,"Written by a leading neuropsychologist, this authoritative volume draws on recent work in psychology and neuroscience to provide a coherent, contemporary account of how memory is organized in the brain. It begins with the synapse and proceeds to a review of the function and structure of neural systems and the organization of cognition. Throughout the book the author takes care to place current research in historical perspective and to identify major ideas and themes that have emerged in recent years so as to provide a solid foundation for future work. The book is amply illustrated and contains a useful glossary.

16002,"Studies of human amnesia and studies of an animal model of human amnesia in the monkey have identified the anatomical components of the brain system for memory in the medial temporal lobe and have illuminated its function. This neural system consists of the hippocampus and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. These structures, presumably by virtue of their widespread and reciprocal connections with neocortex, are essential for establishing long-term memory for facts and events (declarative memory). The medial temporal lobe memory system is needed to bind together the distributed storage sites in neocortex that represent a whole memory. However, the role of this system is only temporary. As time passes after learning, memory stored in neocortex gradually becomes independent of medial temporal lobe structures.",Larry R Squire and Stuart Zola-Morgan,3807,7517173505461322267,Science,5026,1380-1386,American Association for the Advancement of Science,The medial temporal lobe memory system,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/253/5026/1380.abstract,253,1991,/scholar?cites=7517173505461322267,Un_yatgAAAAJ:EsEWqaRxkBgC

16006,"During the past 100 years clinical studies of amnesia have linked memory impairment to damage of the hippocampus. Yet the damage in these cases has not usually been confined to the hippocampus, and the status of memory functions has often been based on incomplete neuropsychological information. Thus, the human cases have until now left some uncertainty as to whether lesions limited to the hippocampus are sufficient to cause amnesia. Here we report a case of amnesia in a patient (R.B.) who developed memory impairment following an ischemic episode. During the 5 years until his death, R.B. exhibited marked anterograde amnesia, little if any retrograde amnesia, and showed no signs of cognitive impairment other than memory.

16007,"The idea that memory is composed of distinct systems has a long history but became a topic of experimental inquiry only after the middle of the 20th century. Beginning about 1980, evidence from normal subjects, amnesic patients, and experimental animals converged on the view that a fundamental distinction could be drawn between a kind of memory that is accessible to conscious recollection and another kind that is not. Subsequent work shifted thinking beyond dichotomies to a view, grounded in biology, that memory is composed of multiple separate systems supported, for example, by the hippocampus and related structures, the amygdala, the neostriatum, and the cerebellum.

Amnesic patients exhibited normal learning of the task but had severely impaired declarative memory for the training episode. In contrast, patients with Parkinson9s disease failed to learn the probabilistic classification task, despite having intact memory for the training episode. This double dissociation shows that the limbic-diencephalic regions damaged in amnesia and the neostriatum damaged in Parkinson9s disease support separate and parallel learning systems.

16025,"Three important developments have occurred in the area of memory during the past decade. The first was the recognition that there is more than one kind of memory (Cohen 1984; Schacter 1987; Squire 1982; Tulving 1985). Declarative memory (or, explicit memory) affords the capacity for conн scious recollections about facts and events. This is the kind of memory that is usually referred to when the terms"" memory"" or"" remembering"" are used in ordinary language.

In addition, the patients were impaired to a similar extent at Remembering and Knowing, measures of the two processes thought to support recognition performance: the ability to remember the learning episode (episodic recollection) and the capacity for judging items as familiar (familiarity).",Joseph R Manns and Ramona O Hopkins and Jonathan M Reed and Erin G Kitchener and Larry R Squire,525,7553226452050486044,Neuron,1,171-180,Cell Press,Recognition memory and the human hippocampus,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627302011479,37,2003,/scholar?cites=7553226452050486044,Un_yatgAAAAJ:YPNY0knpFBYC

16053,The concept of memory consolidation—the idea that memory changes with the passage of time after learning—has been discussed and debated throughout this century in the disciplines of experimental psychology. physiological psychology. and neuropsychology. What is striking about these various inquiries is that each has had its own developmental history and that there has seldom been good correspondence among the disciplines in how memory consolidation should be viewed. lt will be our contention here that converging evidence from all three disciplines now permits a new and coherent view of memory consolidation. This chapter presents evidence that memory changes for a long time after learning and describes a new framework in which the concept of memory consolidation can be placed.Consolidation theory had its beginnings in experimental psychology as a way of explaining the detrimental effects on retention of a learning experience interpolated during the retention interval tMuller & Pilzecker. 1900l. The shorter the interval between original learning and interpolated learning. the greater the deficit. lt was supposed that the formation of stable memory required somc change to occur after learning and that interpolated learning interfered with this stabilizing process. However. such an account of these data was eventually replaced by interference theory tsee Keppel. this volumet. which was deemed to provide a better explanation of both these and many other data. Current work on memory within cognitive psychology has largely ignored consolidation. focusing instead,Larry R Squire and Neal J Cohen and Lynn Nadel,476,2012204413342339875,Memory consolidation: Psychobiology of cognition,,185-210,Psychology Press,The medial temporal region and memory consolidation: A new hypothesis,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2012204413342339875&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1984,/scholar?cites=2012204413342339875,Un_yatgAAAAJ:-w1eE4La9_EC

The amnesic patients were impaired on four of these tasks (delayed nonmatching to sample, object-reward association, 8-pair concurrent discrimination learning, and an object discrimination task), in correspondence with previous findings for monkeys with bilateral medial temporal or diencephalic lesions. Moreover, performance of the amnesic patients correlated with the ability to verbalize the principle underlying the tasks and with the ability to describe and recognize the stimulus materials.

Amnesic patients and control subjects performed a serial reaction time task, exhibiting equivalent learning of an imbedded repeating sequence as measured by gradually improving reaction times. In contrast, four tests of declarative (explicit) knowledge indicated that the amnesic patients were unaware of their knowledge. Moreover, after taking the tests of declarative memory, all subjects continued to demonstrate tacit knowledge of the repeating sequence.

16085,"Introduction The origin of the concept of memory consolidation and the introduction of the term “consolidirung”(consolidation) to the modern science of memory are generally credited to Georg Elias Müller (1850–1934), professor at the University of Göttingen, Germany, and his student Alfons Pilzecker. Their seminal monograph “Experimentelle Beiträge zur Lehre vom Gedächtnis”(Experimental Contributions to the Science of Memory), published in 1900, proposed that learning does not induce instantaneous, permanent memories but that memory takes time to be fixed (or consolidated). Consequently, memory remains vulnerable to disruption for a period of time after learning.Georg Müller was among the founders of experimental psychology. Inspired by the work of Gustav Fechner (1801–1887), Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), and Herman Ebbinghaus (1859–1909), 1 he was an early advocate of the view that mental …",Hilde A Lechner and Larry R Squire and John H Byrne,351,3075289334164361026,Learning & Memory,2,77-87,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,100 years of consolidation—remembering Müller and Pilzecker,http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/6/2/77.short,6,1999,/scholar?cites=3075289334164361026,Un_yatgAAAAJ:KWzIFqRkAKkC
