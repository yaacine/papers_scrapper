20001,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States and is responsible for 17% of national health expenditures. As the population ages, these costs are expected to increase substantially.To prepare for future cardiovascular care needs, the American Heart Association developed methodology to project future costs of care for hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and all other CVD from 2010 to 2030. This methodology avoided double counting of costs for patients with multiple cardiovascular conditions. By 2030, 40.5% of the US population is projected to have some form of CVD. Between 2010 and 2030, real (2008$) total direct medical costs of CVD are projected to triple, from $273 billion to $818 billion.

20006,"Injuries are one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States today. Through premature death, disability, medical cost and lost productivity, injuries impact the health and welfare of all Americans. Deaths only begin to tell the story. Although many injuries are minor, a large proportion result in fractures, amputations, burns, or other significant injuries that have far-reaching consequences. Now, for the first time in over 15 years, we have comprehensive estimates of the impact of these injuries in economic terms. This book updates a landmark Report to Congress from 1989. Since the report, no undertaking has addressed the incidence and economic burden of injuries with more timely data, despite major changes in the fields of prevention, reporting, and surveillance. Since the mid-eighties, new safety technologies have been developed to prevent injuries or to decrease the severity of injuries, and new policies and laws have been enacted to promote injury prevention.

A health expenditure questionnaire was used to assess the direct cost of myopia.Results.: A total of 113 (90.4%) of 125 myopic subjects participated in the survey. The mean cost was approximately SGD $900 (USD $709) per person per year. The lifetime per capita cost ranged from SGD $295 (USD $232) for those with 0 year's duration to SGD $21,616 (USD $17,020) for those with 80 years' duration. Costs of spectacles, contact lenses, and optometry services were the major cost drivers, contributing to an average of 65% of total costs. Seven subjects (6.2%) had undergone LASIK surgery, resulting in a cost of SGD $4891 (USD $3851) per patient per year. Three subjects (2.7%) reported annual costs of (SGD $33 or USD $26) for complications due to LASIK surgery or contact lenses. There was an increasing cost of myopia in adults who started to wear glasses at earlier ages.

Using regression analysis, we estimated the effect of being in each of the cancer care groups on out-of-pocket medical expenditures, the probability of being employed, and the annual number of workdays missed because of illness or injury. RESULTS: Being actively treated for cancer increases the mean annual out-of-pocket medical expenditures by $1170 compared with not having cancer. Less intensive cancer care is associated with lower medical expenditures (but still higher than for those without cancer).

20093,"Injury is a common and cosdy childhood affliction, accounting for approximately 15% of medical spending among those ages 1-19 years. Indeed, for children and adolescents 5-19 years of age, injury rivals the common cold in frequency."" Injuries, however, are much more likely than colds to have lasting effects. Injury has long been the leading mechanism of death among those ages 1-19.4 In 2000, almost 18 000 children and adolescents were killed by injuries. Another 160000 children and adolescents were permanendy disabled as a result of an injury. Coupled with its high death rate, the frequency and severity of nonfatal injury make it a cosdy childhood health problem. Quantifying the costs associated with childhood injuries is important. Cost estimates translate different injuries—deaths, broken legs, dog bites, even rapes—to a common metric, and allow injuries to be compared with other prevalent health conditions. This makes cost data a useful element in gauging the relative size of various problems, assessing risks, setting research priorities, and selecting interventions that most efficiendy reduce the burden of injury. For example, injury costs by diagnosis can inform a decision between spending a playground improvement budget to fix swings (estimated to prevent 7 broken arms at a total medical cost of $14 300) or to fix slides (estimated to prevent2 broken legs at a total medical cost of $11 200).

20107,"Objectives The goal of this study is: (1) to estimate the current direct out-of-pocket (OOP) and indirect non-communicable diseases (NCD) burden on Indonesian households and (2) to project NCD prevalence and burden in 2020 focusing specifically on hypertension, diabetes, heart problems and stroke.  Methods This study relies on econometric analyses based on four waves of the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS).  Results In aggregate, of the NCDs studied, heart problems exert the greatest economic burden on households, costing Int$1.56 billion in OOP and indirect burden in 2010. This was followed by hypertension (Int$1.36 billion), diabetes (Int$0.81 billion) and stroke (Int$0.29 billion). The OOP and indirect burden of these conditions is estimated to be Int$4.02 billion. Diabetes and stroke are expected to have the largest proportional increases in burden by 2020; 56.0% for diabetes and 56.9% for stroke to total Int$1.27 billion and Int$0.45 billion respectively. The burden of heart problems in 2020 is expected to increase by 34.4% to total Int$2.09 billion and hypertension burden will increase by 46.1% to Int$1.99 billion. In 2020, these conditions are expected to impose an economic burden of Int$5.80 billion.  Conclusion In conclusion, this study demonstrates the significant burden of 4 primary NCDs on Indonesian households.

Topics covered in this book highlight the multidisciplinary nature of epidemiology.Each chapter includes a summary and one or more case studies intended to illustrate major points from the chapter and to provide a basis for teaching exercises. All of the chapters are authored by leading experts in the fields of epidemiology and public health. The authors present epidemiology as a foundation of public health. Some of the historical contributions of epidemiology are described and the most pressing current issues encountered in the …,Julia Seifert,34,8293802251162669907,,10,926-926,BMJ Publishing Group Ltd,Incidence and economic burden of injuries in the United States,https://jech.bmj.com/content/61/10/926.2.extract,61,2007,/scholar?cites=8293802251162669907,wzvZQeIAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC
20110,"We combine two of the most widely used measures in the inequality and poverty literature, the concentration index and Foster–Greer–Thorbecke metric to the analysis of socioeconomic inequality in obesity. This enables us to describe socioeconomic inequality not only in obesity status but also in its depth and severity. We apply our method to 1971–2012 US data and show that while the socioeconomic inequality in obesity status has now almost disappeared, this is not the case when depth and severity of obesity are considered. Such socioeconomic gradient is found to be greatest among non‐Hispanic whites, but decomposition analysis also reveals an inverse relationship between income and obesity outcomes among Mexican Americans once the effect of immigrant status has been accounted for.

20111,"Singapore is in the midst of several healthcare reforms in efforts to finance and deliver health services for a rapidly aging population. The primary focus of these reforms is to make healthcare services, including those at the end of life (EOL), affordable. Given the increasingly high health care costs at the EOL, policy makers need to consider how best to allocate resources. One strategy is to allocate resources based on the preferences of sub-populations most likely to be affected. This paper thus aims to quantify preferences for EOL care both among community dwelling older adults (CDOAs) and among patients with a life-limiting illness. A discrete choice experiment was administered to CDOAs and advanced cancer patients in Singapore and willingness to pay (WTP) for specific EOL improvements was estimated. We find that patients have a higher WTP for nearly all EOL attributes compared with CDOAs.

20115,"Introduction: Myopia is a significant public health problem in Singapore with estimates that more than 50% of the population is affected by it by the time of adulthood. Childhood obesity is also increasing and has been linked to long-term health problems. Recent studies have found that Singaporean children in Primary 1 spend less than 3 hours a day outdoors which is less than children in other countries. Physical activity has been shown to be protective against obesity and recently, there has been some evidence to suggest that time spent outdoors may reduce the prevalence and severity of myopia. This study aims to explore the barriers and enablers to children in Singapore participating in outdoor activities. Materials and Methods: Qualitative data, gathered from focus group discussions was thematically analysed against the PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model which provided a conceptual framework for examining factors relevant to children participating in an outdoor activity intervention. A total of 31 people participated in 4 focus groups held over a 6-month period. Results: This feasibility study was exploratory in nature but provided valuable information concerning barriers and enablers to participation. Data informed the development of a larger study.

20120,"Corneal endothelial transplantation or endothelial keratoplasty has become the preferred choice of transplantation for patients with corneal blindness due to endothelial dysfunction. Currently, there is a worldwide shortage of transplantable tissue, and demand is expected to increase further with aging populations. Tissue-engineered alternatives are being developed, and are likely to be available soon. However, the cost of these constructs may impair their widespread use. A cost-minimization analysis comparing tissue-engineered constructs to donor tissue procured from eye banks for endothelial keratoplasty was performed. Both initial investment costs and recurring costs were considered in the analysis to arrive at a final tissue cost per transplant. The clinical outcomes of endothelial keratoplasty with tissue-engineered constructs and with donor tissue procured from eye banks were assumed to be equivalent. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to simulate various possible scenarios, and to determine the robustness of the results. A tissue engineering strategy was cheaper in both investment cost and recurring cost. Tissue-engineered constructs for endothelial keratoplasty could be produced at a cost of US$880 per transplant. In contrast, utilizing donor tissue procured from eye banks for endothelial keratoplasty required US$3,710 per transplant.

20128,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Estimated to affect 60 million people worldwide, this figure is expected to rise to 80 million by 2020. Untreated, glaucoma leads to visual decay and eventually to blindness, and can significantly reduce quality of life. First-line treatment in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma is topical medical therapy with ocular hypotensives as eye drops. However, eye drops have several disadvantages including cost, possible local and systemic side effects, and adherence and perseverance issues. Randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that selective laser trabeculoplasty is equally as effective in lowering intraocular pressure as eye drops. However, the impact of these two treatment modalities from the patient and economic perspectives has not been adequately determined. Thus, it remains unclear whether topical medical therapy or selective laser trabeculoplasty should be recommended as first-line treatment for glaucoma. This protocol describes an international, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial to determine the optimum first-line therapy for people with primary open-angle glaucoma and exfoliative glaucoma. This study will compare the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and topical medication with respect to patients’ generic and glaucoma-specific quality of life.

20138,"Objectives: To estimate the effect of price, sociodemographic factors, and health on the demand for bariatric surgery among eligible individuals with private health insurance, in order to enable policy makers and insurers to make more informed decisions concerning access to care for bariatric surgery. Study Design: We conducted an Internet-based contingent valuation survey of 1802 obese persons eligible for bariatric surgery but who had not undergone the procedure. Methods: We used multivariate regression analysis to separately estimate the likelihood of having gastric bypass and gastric banding surgery at different out-of-pocket costs. We combined the results with estimates of the privately insured bariatric surgery–eligible population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002, to estimate aggregate demand. Results: Out-of-pocket cost was negatively and highly significantly related to the self-reported likelihood of having surgery. Persons with higher incomes and younger persons also reported a significantly higher likelihood of surgery. No effect was found for body mass index or for most comorbidities. We estimate that about 150 000 bariatric operations per year would be demanded by those with private health insurance at an out-of-pocket cost of $25 000. At $5000, we estimate a demand of 250 000 bariatric operations per year.Conclusions: Price is significantly and negatively related to the demand for bariatric surgery.

Whether there is an independent relationship between area-level measures of SES (eg, living in a lower SES environment) and visual impairment is unclear. This study describes the associations of area-level SES with visual impairment.Methods.: The authors conducted two population-based cross-sectional studies of 3280 adult Malays and 3400 adult Indians living in Singapore. Visual impairment was defined as LogMAR visual acuity> 0.30 in the better-seeing eye. Area-level SES measures (eg, proportion of people not speaking English, proportion of people with low income) were derived from the Singapore's 2000 population census.Results.: Increasing age and individual-level SES measures (including lower education level, lower income level, and lower occupational status) were significantly associated with increased odds of visual impairment. In analyses adjusting for age and individual-level SES measures, many area-level SES measures (eg, higher proportion of people not using English, higher proportion of people with low income) were also significantly associated with increased odds of visual impairment. These associations were consistently observed in both Malays and Indians.Conclusions.: These data suggest that not only is a person's SES, but the SES of his or her immediate community, is associated with visual impairment.

The age-, sex-, and comorbidity adjusted probabilities of undergoing selected, potentially discretionary procedures, were compared within each plan by payment method. Results: After adjustment, rates under fee-for-service payment tended to be higher than those under capitation or salary payment, whereas there was no clear pattern for salary versus capitation payment. Even within a single specialty in a single plan, however, rates did not always follow the same pattern for different procedures. Conclusions: The payment method for specialty services used by these 3 health plans was variably associated with how likely patients were to undergo a variety of invasive procedures.

including a discussion of both per capita and aggregate annual and lifetime medical costs
attributable to obesity, and external costs funded by public sector health plans. A description
on the implications of these findings for setting health policy is also given. The lifetime cost
estimates are consistently positive, revealing that successful obesity-prevention efforts have the
potential to be both health improving and cost saving over time. Obesity does impose significant
health costs on publicly funded health plans, which many have deemed a financial externality.
It is worth noting that if the high total or external costs of obesity are the underlying justification
for publicly funded obesity interventions, then, regardless of how effective an intervention is at
reducing weight, unless it is cost-saving, it ultimately raises costs even more.

20188,"Many glaucoma patients do not adhere to their medication regimens because they fail to internalize the (health) costs of non-adherence, which may not occur until years or decades later. Behavioural economic theory suggests that adherence rates can be improved by offering patients a near-term benefit. Our proposed strategy is to offer adherence-contingent rebates on medication and check-up costs. This form of value pricing (VP) ensures that rebates are granted only to those most likely to benefit.

20189,"Despite the promise and popularity of advance care planning, there is insufficient evidence that advance care planning helps patients to meet their end-of-life care preferences, especially in Asian settings. Thus, the proposed study aims to assess whether patients with advanced heart failure who are receiving advance care planning have a greater likelihood of receiving end-of-life care consistent with their preferences compared to patients receiving usual care. Secondary objectives are to compare differences in health care expenditures, quality of life, anxiety and depression, understanding of own illness, participation in decision-making and concordance with their caregiver’s preferences for end-of-life care, between patients with advanced heart failure receiving advance care planning and usual care. This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial of advance care planning versus usual care (control) conducted at two institutions in Singapore.

Lack of effective referral networks between different levels of the health system is one factor that threatens the ability to achieve adequate blood pressure control and prevent CVD-related morbidity. Health information technology and peer support are two strategies that have improved care coordination and clinical outcomes for other disease entities in other settings; however, their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in strengthening referral networks to improve blood pressure control and reduce CVD risk in low-resource settings are unknown.

Black women are disproportionately likely to have both obesity and limited weight loss readiness. However, they have been shown to be receptive to strategies that prevent weight gain.Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of a digital weight gain prevention intervention (Shape) for black women. Shape consisted of adaptive telephone-based coaching by health system personnel, a tailored skills training curriculum, and patient self-monitoring delivered via a fully automated interactive voice response system.Methods: A cost and cost-effectiveness analysis based on a randomized clinical trial of the Shape intervention was conducted from the payer perspective. Costs included those of delivering the program to 91 intervention participants in the trial and were summarized by program elements: self-monitoring, skills training, coaching, and administration. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The primary outcome was the incremental cost per QALY of Shape relative to usual care.Results: Shape cost an average of US $758 per participant. The base-case model in which quality of life benefits decay linearly to zero 5 years post intervention cessation, generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $55,264 per QALY.

We aimed to examine the effect of framing a modest price difference between high- and lower-sugar beverages as a tax or a subsidy respectively, using messages placed on vending machines to influence beverage purchases. This is an 11-week randomized crossover trial conducted between August and November 2015, with a two-week run-in period before intervention, targeted at students, staff and faculty of a university campus in Singapore. Twenty-one beverage vending machines were used to implement the intervention involving ‘tax message’, ‘subsidy message’ and ‘no message (control)’. The former two messages suggest ‘a tax for high sugar beverages’ or ‘a subsidy for lower sugar beverages’ respectively. Prices of the beverages offered were fixed at baseline and remained the same in all three experimental conditions: lower-sugar beverage options were priced ~ 10% lower than the corresponding high-sugar option. The machines were randomized to one of the 6 sequences of intervention. Each message intervention period was 3 weeks. The effect of messages was assessed by comparing average weekly units of beverages sold between interventions using mixed effects model.

The components of the MCI are: (1) an algorithm-driven antihypertensive treatment for all hypertensive individuals using single-pill combination (SPC) and lipid-lowering medication for high-risk hypertensive individuals, (2) a motivational conversation for high-risk hypertensive individuals, (3) telephone-based follow-ups of all hypertensive individuals by polyclinic nurses, and (4) discounts on SPC antihypertensive medications. The trial will be conducted with 1000 individuals aged ≥ 40 years with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, based on the mean of the last two of three measurements) in eight polyclinics in Singapore. The primary outcome is change in systolic BP from baseline to follow-up at 24 months post-randomization. The incremental cost of MCI per CVD disability adjusted life years (DALY) averted and quality adjusted life years (QALY) saved will be computed.

20232,"Although the underlying causes of the worldwide obesity epidemic are multifaceted and extend across all dimensions of the socio-ecological model, economics is at the heart of the problem. Economic forces have made it easier and cheaper to consume high-calorie, tasty, affordable foods. Economic forces have also allowed us to be increasingly sedentary at work, at home, and in between. One ofthe basic tenets ofeconomics is the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. As price decreases, quantity demanded is expected to increase, and vice versa. Demand for food and physical activity is no exception. During the past four decades, food prices have been dropping steadily. For example, in the USA, the relative price of food compared with other goods and services has decreased by~ 16% since 1960 and 38% since 1978. Even more relevant to the obesity epidemic is the fact that highcalorie foods have become much cheaper than healthier alternatives [1]. As these calorie-dense foods become relatively cheaper, people are expected to shift their consumption towards these fattening options [3]. In addition to falling cost in terms of monetary expenditure, technology has also reduced the amount of time and energy it takes to prepare food as evidenced by the sheer volume of restaurants, cafeterias, snack bars, vending machines, and other locations where prepackaged foods with minimal preparation time can be purchased at low prices. These options were not available a few decades ago.So has food consumption increased consistent with falling food costs, both monetary and nonmonetary?

20235,"Objectives: To examine the independent, joint, and fully combined associations of sedentary behavior (SB), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) with the odds of poor sleep quality (SQ). Methods: We performed a secondary data analysis on 757 working adults (male= 345) in Singapore, with an average age of 35.2 years. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to assess SQ. Objectively measured MVPA and SB were each obtained using an accelerometer. A non-exercise prediction equation was used to estimate CRF. Logistic regression models were used to determine associations. Results: In total, 13.2% of the sample (n= 100) was identified as having poor SQ. After adjusting for study covariates, independent analyses revealed a clear inverse association for higher CRF and lower odds of poor SQ (OR= 0.50; 95% CI= 0.28–0.91). SB and MVPA demonstrated no independent associations. Joint associations revealed that odds of having poor SQ for those with low CRF was higher regardless of SB level and was further deteriorated by lower MVPA in the fully combined model. The fully combined model also demonstrated that those with lower SB, higher MVPA, and higher CRF had the lowest odds of having poor SQ (OR= 0.28; 95% CI= 0.10–0.78). Conclusions: Physical activity/exercise training programs that aim to improve CRF may be useful in lowering the odds or poor SQ in working adults.

20237,"Introduction: We investigated the awareness of palliative care (PC) services in advanced cancer patients and their family caregivers and whether negative perceptions was a possible barrier to PC utilisation in Singapore. Materials and Methods: Patients with stage 4 solid cancer and their caregivers were interviewed between July 2016 and March 2018 at outpatient clinics located in the medical oncology departments of 2 major public hospitals in Singapore. Patients and caregivers were asked whether they were aware of PC services, how they first learned about them, who first recommended PC to the patient, whether the patient had received PC, and reasons for not receiving PC. Results: Awareness of PC was lower in patients compared to caregivers (43% vs 53%; P< 0.01). The odds of being aware in patients was higher if they had higher education (odds ratio [OR]= 2.927; P< 0.001) and higher income (OR= 1.798; P= 0.005). Compared to patients, more caregivers reported that a healthcare provider recommended PC to the patient (10% vs 20%; P< 0.012). Furthermore, 7% of patients and 15% of caregivers reported that the patient received PC (P= 0.031). The most common reasons for not receiving PC reported by patients and caregivers (respectively) were that the patient was still receiving treatment (68% and 78%), it is not time for PC (76% and 59%) and PC would not be of help (18% and 19%).

20247,"The incidence of diabetes has been increasingly rapidly in most countries in Asia. As a result, reducing the incidence and severity of diabetes and other chronic diseases has become a major public health and economic imperative. The onset and management of diabetes and other chronic diseases are often related to or driven by suboptimal behaviors, including inactivity, poor diet, low uptake of screening and other preventive services, and poor medication adherence. Behavioral economics, which integrates economics and psychology to study and influence the way people make choices, has emerged as a promising tool to address these suboptimal behaviors. This manuscript presents the key insights from behavioral economics as they relate to diabetes and chronic disease prevention and treatment, including the theoretical motivation for select interventions and results from a comprehensive literature review. The manuscript concludes with recommendations for how best to incorporate behavioral economics into mainstream health promotion activities for the prevention of diabetes and other chronic diseases and includes recommendations for future research initiatives.",V Hai Nguyen and Ho Teck-Hua and Finkelstein Eric,2,11901551910998021524,,,,Mimeo,Using Behavioral Economics to Improve Diabetes Prevention and Treatment in Asia: A Literature Review and Recommendations,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/364e/dec9befe14a5401f0b6882b5977e640f898b.pdf,,2013,/scholar?cites=11901551910998021524,wzvZQeIAAAAJ:ye4kPcJQO24C

20250,"The rising prevalence of non-communicable diseases has brought attention to the importance of consuming a healthy diet. One strategy to improve diet quality is through front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labels. Taking advantage of an online grocery store, we allowed consumers to choose the FOP labels they preferred, and combined this information with real-time feedback on the overall nutritional quality of the shopping basket. We hypothesized that these dynamic food labels with real-time feedback (DFLF) would improve nutritional quality of food purchases. This trial followed a two-arm (no-label control and DFLF) crossover design with 125 participants exposed to each condition once in random order via an online grocery store. A first difference regression model allowed for estimating the unbiased effect of the DFLF on diet quality, measured by the weighted average Nutri-Score (ranging 1 to 5) per serving (primary) and changes in select nutrients and calories. The mean weighted Nutri-Score was 0.4 (12.6%) higher in the DFLF arm (CI:[0.2, 0.6]) relative to the control. The DFLF also decreased the amount of sugar per serving by 0.9 g (CI:[− 1.7,− 0.0]) and total sugar per shop by 169.5 g (CI:[− 284.5,− 54.5]). The DFLF features significantly improved nutrition quality relative to no labelling, as measured by average Nutri-Score values. These results shed light on the considerable potential of the online shopping environment to improve diet quality through customization and real time feedback.

Some of these therapies are already in clinical use, while others are still in clinical trials or the experimental phase. Most initial studies in the evaluation of new therapies focus on demonstration of clinical efficacy. However, cost considerations or economic viability are just as important. Many tissue‐engineered therapies have failed to be impactful because of shortcomings in economic competitiveness, rather than clinical efficacy.

20275,"Despite decades of effort, around 2.8 billion people worldwide still rely on solid fuels such as wood, dung and coal to meet their basic domestic energy needs.[1] This places strain on economies, human wellbeing and the environment. The use of solid fuels–exposing people to smoke from cooking–is the fourth most significant risk factor for disease in developing countries, causing four million premature deaths in 2010.[2] What people do, ie their behaviours–for example, which cooking method and fuel they use; where they burn fires; how they use ventilation; and where children and adults are located–affects quality of life and can contribute to climate change.The aim of this study was to review the use of behaviour change approaches in clean cooking interventions in resource-poor settings. Using publicly available data, the report synthesises the evidence of the use of behaviour change techniques (BCTs) for human and environmental outcomes and impact. The report includes a set of case studies on selected interventions that use BCTs and applies a scorecard to assess the effectiveness of each intervention’s approach to behaviour change. The report then discusses the findings from the review and case studies and includes a set of recommendations for the clean cooking sector to consider.

Outcomes were adoption of, or increased frequency of preventive behaviours (avoiding social events; avoiding public transport; reducing time spent shopping and eating out; wearing a mask in public; avoiding hospitals/clinics; keeping children out of school, washing hands/using sanitisers; keeping surroundings clean; avoiding touching public surfaces; working from/studying at home). Public perceptions regarding COVID-19 (chances of getting COVID-19; perceived likelihood of COVID-19-related intensive care unit (ICU) admission; government trust; self-efficacy; perceived appropriateness of COVID-19 behaviours; response efficacy), anxiety, and demographic characteristics (age; ethnicity; marital status; education; chronic conditions; current living arrangements) were investigated as predictors of preventive behaviours adopted during COVID-19 in binomial and ordered logistic regressions.

20296,"Background In Singapore, 37% of adults are insufficiently active despite widespread opportunities for physical activity (PA). Research shows that PA can be increased by use of group-based extrinsic incentives. This study evaluates whether a novel incentive design linking children’s incentives to both their own and their parent’s PA (measured via pedometers) can increase parents’ PA without compromising children’s PA.Methods We conducted a two-arm, parallel, open-labelled randomized controlled trial where parentchild dyads were randomly assigned to either (1) rewards to the child contingent on child’s PA (childbased) or (2) rewards to the child contingent on both child’s and parent’s PA (family-based). Parents had to be English-speaking, computer-literate, non-pregnant, full-time employees, aged 25–65 years, and with a participating child aged 7–11 years. Parent-child dyads were randomized within strata (self-reported low vs high weekly PA) into study arms in a 1: 1 ratio. Participants were given pedometers to assess daily steps. The primary outcome was the between-arm difference in the change from baseline in parent’s mean steps/day measured by accelerometry at months 6 and 12. Results 159 and 157 parent-child dyads were randomized to the child-based or family-based arms, respectively, and all with outcomes evaluated an intent-to-treat perspective. At month 6, there was a statistically significant 613 steps/day (95% CI: 54–1171) differential in favour of family-based parents.

20301,"Objectives: To assess the extent to which public support for outbreak containment policies varies with respect to the severity of an infectious disease outbreak.   Methods: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1,017 residents of Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, gender and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among 5 policies restricting local movement and 4 border control policies) they would support in 5 randomly-assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics and perceived policy effectiveness.   Results: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies; however, was generally higher for border control policies compared to internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher income and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support.

20322,"BackgroundInitially developed in marketing science, Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are being applied in an increasing number of fields, including the environment, transportation, and health. While DCEs can be used to analyze a great variety of issues such as calculating market shares, quantifying the value of non-market goods, and predicting uptake of new services, all applications share a key feature that is intrinsic to DCEs: respondents need to trade between the attributes of the choice tasks they are presented with. The validity of all studies involving DCEs thus critically depends on the validity of the tradeoffs made by the respondents. A well-documented concern is that various hypothetical biases can affect the elicitation of these tradeoffs. The external validity of DCEs is currently under-researched because few settings provide the analyst with data on both revealed and stated preferences simultaneously. In this study, we administrated a DCE to participants of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to make it possible to compare these two types of data. We focus on one type of hypothetical bias that can adversely affect the validity of DCEs. When an attribute relates to a behavior, respondents might underestimate the effort that is required from them to change their behavior and report unrealistic tradeoffs. While such potential bias can in theory apply to numerous settings, its study is especially relevant to health as respondents might be overly optimistic while stating not only their participation in new public health programs but also the extent of their involvement. Such potential optimism biases warrant to assessment of the external validity of …",Marcel Bilger and Eric Andrew Finkelstein and Isha Chaudhry,0,,,,,,Predicting Behavioral Change using Stated Preferences: Comparison of Preferences Expressed in a Discrete Choice Experiment to Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial on …,http://www.icmconference.org.uk/index.php/icmc/ICMC2017/paper/view/1113,,2017,,wzvZQeIAAAAJ:ce2CqMG-AY4C

20334,"PURPOSE: To determine the long-term costeffectiveness of osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis (OOKP) relative to no treatment among patients with end-stage corneal and ocular surface diseases in Singapore. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on data from a retrospective cohort study.METHODS: From a health system perspective, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of OOKP treatment relative to no treatment over a 30-year horizon, based on data from a cohort of 23 patients who underwent OOKP surgery between 2004 and 2009 at Singapore National Eye Centre. Preoperative and postoperative vision-related quality-of-life values were estimated from patients’ visual outcomes and were used to calculate the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from OOKP treatment. Unsubsidized costs for surgery, consultations, examinations, medications, follow-up visits, and treatments for complications were retrieved from patients’ bills to estimate the total costs associated with OOKP treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over a 30-year period, OOKP treatment, compared with no treatment, improved QALYs by 3.991 among patients with end-stage corneal and ocular surface diseases at an additional cost of S $67 840 (US $55 150), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of S $17 000/QALY (US $13 820/QALY).

20350,"The authors fınd that for this population subset, influenza vaccination led to a 4.4–percentage point reduction in the probability of an inpatient admission for ACRC. However, they could not reject the hypothesis that vaccination had no effect on annual ACRC (and presumably total) medical expenditures. This latter fınding was partly a result of higher prescriptiondrug expenditures among the ACRC population that partially offset the savings in hospitalization costs. Regardless, the authors conclude that “increased vaccination rates among adults with asthma bring signifıcant benefıts in terms of reducing the rates and the costs of hospitalization and possible improvements in medication compliance.” 3This well-executed study makes two important contributions to the literature on the effect of influenza vaccination in the adult asthma population. First, it is the fırst study to provide nationally representative estimates of the effect of vaccination on medical care utilization and expenditures in this population subset.

20364,"The National Research Council and the Institute of Medicine’s 1985 report Injury in America: A Continuing Public Health Problem focused attention on the high rate of unintentional injuries, including those resulting from motor vehicle crashes in the United States, and garnered support for research and programs to address the problem. Subsequent review of public health surveillance also brought the problem of unintentional injuries into focus (Thacker and Berkelman, 1988). Motor vehicle–related injuries kill more children and young adults (ie, those aged 1 to 24) than any other cause in the United States (Future of Children, 2000). Motor vehicle occupant deaths are the leading cause of unintentional death among adolescents aged 15 to 19, accounting for 19.11 per 100,000 deaths (compared with 2.08 per 100,000 deaths for the second leading cause, drowning or submersion)(CDC, 2000). Teenage drivers in particular are overrepresented in motor vehicle crashes (American Academy of Pediatrics, 1996; CDC, 1996; Ferguson et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1998; Massie, Campbell, and Williams, 1995; Phebo and Dellinger, 1998; Williams, 1996). In 2000, total lifetime costs of motor vehicle injuries were $19 billion for males ages 15 to 24 and $7 billion for females ages 15 to 24 (Finkelstein et al., 2006).

20370,"Despite recent declines in violence in general and among youth and young adults in particular, violence still remains a serious public health issue, in part because both fatal and nonfatal injury exact a tremendous toll on our public health system and on the social fabric of communities and families. Practitioners, researchers, and policy makers have each proposed or hypothesized myriad solutions to this ongoing problem that is complicated by the complex interaction of factors that either increase risk (ie, risk factors) or buffer against it (ie, protective factors).Violence has a profound impact on today’s youth and affects their chances of maturing into healthy functioning adults. It is defined as the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or a community that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation (Krug et al., 2002). Although the majority of the US adolescent population is healthy, hopeful, and able to meet the challenges of adult life, approximately one-quarter of the 31 million children aged 10 to 17 are in dire need of intervention, because they are at risk of engaging in multiple problem behaviors, including violence (Dryfoos, 1990; USDHHS, 2001).

In this study, unit costs for a series of hospitalized and non-hospitalized injuries are computed using the two approaches to allow for a direct comparison of the results.METHODS: We use claims data from the Medicare fee-for-service 5% Standard Analytical Files. The claims contain detailed payment information for all covered services for hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, skilled nursing, home health, hospice, physicians/supplier services and durable medical equipment. For the case-control design, fallers are tracked for 1-year after their first fall, and costs are compared to annual costs for a comparison sample of non-fallers. A generalized linear regression model with a logged dependent variable and a gamma distribution is used to estimate costs while controlling for covariates (including differences in demographics and comorbidities between fallers and non-fallers). The case-crossover sample compares monthly costs of fallers pre-and post-fall and is again estimated using a generalized linear regression model with a logged dependent variable and gamma distribution. This model also uses a cluster option to account for clustering within individuals across months.RESULTS: We present unit costs for falls requiring 1) a hospitalization resulting in a live discharge, 2) an emergency department visit not resulting in an admission, and 3) falls requiring office-based or hospital outpatient visits only.

Taxing less healthy foods with low nutrient density reduced energy (caloric) intake, while reducing the proportion of fat and increasing the proportion of protein purchased. Subsidizing more healthful foods with high nutrient density increased energy intake, without changing the macronutrient proﬁle of foods purchased.

20384,"BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases globally. However, World Health Organization disability-adjusted life year estimates indicate that the average population-level impact of schistosomiasis is minimal. The magnitude of burden due to the Asian strain, Schistosoma japonicum, remains particularly controversial. Comprehensive re-assessment of burden due to Schistosoma japonicum is urgently needed. METHODS: We constructed decision tree models to re-estimate the disability weight for schistosomiasis for all affected persons and age-specific cohorts. We identified estimates of morbidity prevalence and disability weights by searching electronic databases, reviewing bibliographies, and contacting S. japonicum research experts. To examine the robustness of findings, we conducted deterministic sensitivity analyses, considering baseline, conservative, and pessimistic scenarios. RESULTS: S. japonicum was associated with an overall disability weight of 0.130, with age-specific disability weights of 0.098 for those under 15 years and 0.198 for those 15 years and older. Hepatomegaly, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and diarrhea were the most critical contributors to the overall disability weight. Using the most conservative estimate for each variable simultaneously resulted in overall disability weight of 0.047, and age-specific results of 0.033 (< 15) and 0.091 (³15). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a minimum disability weight of 0.033 to 0.091 would be a more appropriate measure of disability due to Schistosoma japonicum. Findings suggest that Global Burden of Disease methodologies …",Eric Finkelstein,0,,,,,,"133rd Annual Meeting & Exposition December 10-14, 2005 Philadelphia, PA",https://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_120906.htm,,,,wzvZQeIAAAAJ:QD3KBmkZPeQC

We assessed the cost–effectiveness of HLA-B* 5801 testing, an enhanced safety program or strategies with both components. Materials & Methods: The analysis adopted a health systems perspective and considered Singaporean patients with chronic gout, over a lifetime horizon, using allopurinol or probenecid. The model incorporated SJS/TEN and gout treatment outcomes, allele frequencies, drug prices and other medical costs. Results: Based on cost–effectiveness threshold of US $50,000 per qualityadjusted life year, HLA-B* 5801-guided ULT selection or enhanced safety program was not cost–effective. Avoidance of ULTs was the least preferred strategy as uncontrolled gout leads to lower quality-adjusted life years and higher costs. Conclusion: The analysis underscores the need for biomarkers with higher positive predictive value for SJS/TEN, less expensive genetic tests or safety programs, or more effective gout drugs.",Eric Finkelstein and Cynthia Sung,0,,,,,,Cost–effectiveness analysis of genotyping for HLA-B* 5801 and an enhanced safety program in gout patients starting allopurinol in Singapore,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cynthia_Sung/publication/283717814_Cost-effectiveness_analysis_of_genotyping_for_HLA-B5801_and_an_enhanced_safety_program_in_gout_patients_starting_allopurinol_in_Singapore/links/56d6f7a308aee1aa5f75b12f.pdf,,,,wzvZQeIAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC
