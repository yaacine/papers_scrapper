27008," Summary: A key element to a successful Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference is the programming and run performance of the Markov chain. However, the explicit use of quality assessments of the MCMC simulations—convergence diagnostics—in phylogenetics is still uncommon. Here, we present a simple tool that uses the output from MCMC simulations and visualizes a number of properties of primary interest in a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, such as convergence rates of posterior split probabilities and branch lengths. Graphical exploration of the output from phylogenetic MCMC simulations gives intuitive and often crucial information on the success and reliability of the analysis. The tool presented here complements convergence diagnostics already available in other software packages primarily designed for other applications of MCMC.

27016,"The molecular clock hypothesis remains an important conceptual and analytical tool in evolutionary biology despite the repeated observation that the clock hypothesis does not perfectly explain observed DNA sequence variation. We introduce a parametric model that relaxes the molecular clock by allowing rates to vary across lineages according to a compound Poisson process. Events of substitution rate change are placed onto a phylogenetic tree according to a Poisson process. When an event of substitution rate change occurs, the current rate of substitution is modified by a gamma-distributed random variable.

27021,Most workers attempting to infer evolutionary trees from polymorphic data using established parsimony procedures either have ignored frequency information entirely or have tolerated “optimal” solutions that hypothesize ancestors that cannot possibly exist in the space of the original frequencies. We describe a new method for inferring evolutionary trees from gene frequency data that avoids these limitations by enforcing biologically reasonable constraints without discarding the frequency information. The necessity of working directly with frequencies rather than reducing the data by “presence/absence” coding is argued.

This is because long-branch taxa (such as rapidly evolving species) may share character states by chance more often than more closely related taxa share derived character states through common ancestry 1. Despite Kim's warning that added taxa can decrease accuracy 2, some authors have argued that the negative impact of this error, called ‘long-branch attraction’, is minimized when slowly evolving lineages are included to subdivide long branches 3, 4, 5. From this they have concluded that increasing the number of species sampled per lineage results in better accuracy than increasing the number of characters per species 6.

This increasing attention to phylogeny stems from a renewed awareness that correlations between characters may simply be historical artifacts, a possibility considered even by Darwin:We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acqUired through natural selection some one modification of structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and these two modifications, haVing been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in some necessary manner correlated.(Darwin, 1872: 138-139)",David L Swofford and Wayne P Maddison,169,4635958523559728182,"Systematics, historical ecology, and North American freshwater fishes",,,Stanford University Press,"Parsimony, character-state reconstructions, and evolutionary inferences",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wayne_Maddison/publication/237812638_Parsimony_Character-State_Reconstructions_and_Evolutionary_Inferences/links/0deec5388b9cd01aaf000000/Parsimony-Character-State-Reconstructions-and-Evolutionary-Inferences.pdf,1,1992,/scholar?cites=4635958523559728182,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC

We have found several cases of probable LBA by analyzing subsamples from an alignment of 18S rDNA sequences for 133 metazoans. In one example, maximum parsimony analysis of sequences from two rotifers, a ctenophore, and a polychaete annelid resulted in strong support for a tree grouping two “long-branch taxa” (a rotifer and the ctenophore). Maximum-likelihood analysis of the same sequences yielded strong support for a more biologically reasonable “rotifer monophyly” tree.

27035,"As maximum-likelihood approaches to the study of molecular systematics and evolution become both more flexible and more accessible, the importance of understanding the statistical properties of parameter estimation becomes critical. Using variation in NADH-2 sequences for 40 species of requiem sharks, we illustrate that estimates of rate heterogeneity parameters are highly sensitive to taxon sampling when the data are best explained by a mixeddistribution model of among-site rate variation (invariable sites plus gamma distribution [I]). Using computer simulation, we attempt to differentiate two possible causes of this sensitivity. While the possibility of nonstationarity cannot be definitively rejected, our results suggest that sampling error alone provides an adequate explanation for the pattern of uncertainty observed in estimates from the real data.

27036,We have developed a rapid parsimony method for reconstructing ancestral nucleotide states that allows calculation of initial branch lengths that are good approximations to optimal maximum-likelihood estimates under several commonly used substitution models. Use of these approximate branch lengths (rather than fixed arbitrary values) as starting points significantly reduces the time required for iteration to a solution that maximizes the likelihood of a tree. These branch lengths are close enough to the optimal values that they can be used without further iteration to calculate approximate maximum-likelihood scores that are very close to the “exact” scores found by iteration. Several strategies are described for using these approximate scores to substantially reduce times needed for maximum-likelihood tree searches.,James S Rogers and David L Swofford,161,6894747663201205875,Systematic biology,1,77-89,Society of Systematic Zoology,A fast method for approximating maximum likelihoods of phylogenetic trees from nucleotide sequences,https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/47/1/77/1623572,47,1998,/scholar?cites=6894747663201205875,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:4DMP91E08xMC
27037,"Methods for inferring evolutionary trees can be divided into two broad categories: those that operate on a matrix of discrete characters that assigns one or more attributes or character states to each taxon (ie, sequence or gene-family member); and those that operate on a matrix of pairwise distances between taxa, with each distance representing an estimate of the amount of divergence between two taxa since they last shared a common ancestor (see Chapter 1). The most commonly employed discrete-character methods used in molecular phylogenetics are parsimony and maximum-likelihood methods. For molecular data, the character-state matrix is typically an aligned set of DNA or protein sequences, in which the states are the nucleotides A, C, G, and T (ie, DNA sequences) or symbols representing the 20 common amino acids (ie, protein sequences); however, other forms of discrete data such as restriction-site presence/absence and gene-order information also may be used.Parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and some distance methods are examples of a broader class of phylogenetic methods that rely on the use of optimality criteria. Methods in this class all operate by explicitly defining an objective function that returns a score for any input tree topology. This tree score thus allows any two or more trees to be ranked according to the chosen optimality criterion. Ordinarily, phylogenetic inference under criterion-based methods couples the selection of a suitable optimality criterion with a search for an optimal tree topology under that criterion. Because the number of tree topologies grows exponentially with the number of taxa (see Table 1.3 …",David L Swofford and Jack Sullivan,140,8618301306290607822,"The Phylogenetic Handbook: A Practical Approach to DNA and Protein Phylogeny, cáp",,160-206,,Phylogeny inference based on parsimony and other methods using PAUP*,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=Kq6xk_M5dVEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA160&dq=info:zpa8WGBbmncJ:scholar.google.com&ots=dIn-rxWnG7&sig=6FWIi_dtFc_W-jCFkvzR_FqxG80,7,2003,/scholar?cites=8618301306290607822,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC

Most commonly, model parameters are estimated on some initial phylogenetic estimate derived using a rapid method (neighbor-joining or parsimony). Parameters are then held constant during a tree search, and ideally, the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved. However, the effectiveness of this approximation has not been formally assessed, in part because doing so requires computationally intensive, full-optimization analyses.

27072,"Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes an essential step in the biosynthesis of guanine nucleotides. This reaction involves two different chemical transformations, an NAD-linked redox reaction and a hydrolase reaction, that utilize mutually exclusive protein conformations with distinct catalytic residues. How did Nature construct such a complicated catalyst? Here we employ a “Wang-Landau” metadynamics algorithm in hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations to investigate the mechanism of the hydrolase reaction. These simulations show that the lowest energy pathway utilizes Arg418 as the base that activates water, in remarkable agreement with previous experiments. Surprisingly, the simulations also reveal a second pathway for water activation involving a proton relay from Thr321 to Glu431. The energy barrier for the Thr321 pathway is similar to the barrier observed experimentally when Arg418 is removed by mutation. The Thr321 pathway dominates at low pH when Arg418 is protonated, which predicts that the substitution of Glu431 with Gln will shift the pH-rate profile to the right. This prediction is confirmed in subsequent experiments. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Thr321 pathway was present in the ancestral enzyme, but was lost when the eukaryotic lineage diverged. We propose that the primordial IMPDH utilized the Thr321 pathway exclusively, and that this mechanism became obsolete when the more sophisticated catalytic machinery of the Arg418 pathway was installed. Thus, our simulations provide an unanticipated window into the evolution of a complex enzyme.",Donghong Min and Helen R Josephine and Hongzhi Li and Clemens Lakner and Iain S MacPherson and Gavin JP Naylor and David Swofford and Lizbeth Hedstrom and Wei Yang,23,1173913481168939509,PLoS Biol,8,e206,Public Library of Science,An enzymatic atavist revealed in dual pathways for water activation,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060206,6,2008,/scholar?cites=1173913481168939509,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:R3hNpaxXUhUC

27092,"In recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the balance of cladograms, which has generally come to be accepted as meaning the extent to which the internal nodes subtend clades of equal size (Fig. 1). In particular, several studies have suggested that a higher proportion of real cladograms culled from the literature are unbalanced (comb-shaped or pectinate) than would be expected if they were produced by a ran? dom Markovian branching process of spe? ciation (Colless, 1982; Guyer and Slowin--ski, 1991, 1993; Heard, 1992; Mooers et al., 1995). One reason for the interest is method? ological: If cladograms are statistically unbalanced, they will contain a higher pro? portion of long branch lengths than would otherwise be expected, which has implica? tions for the accuracy with which they re? flect true phylogeny (Rohlf et al., 1990).

It is the normalizing constant in Bayes’ formula, and the Bayes factor used to compare two models is a ratio of marginal likelihoods.

27115,"Many sources of information may be available for use in inferring phylo-genetic relationships among a group of taxa. Because different character sets share a common evolutionary history, we expect reliable methods of phylogenetic analysis to recover the correct evolutionary tree regardless of the kind of data employed. To the extent that character sets"" tell the truth"" about their past, phylogenies inferred from different character sets should be congruent with the true tree and therefore with each other. This line of reasoning suggests that congruence among data sets might provide the strongest achievable evidence that a proposed phylogeny is accurate (eg, Penny and Hendy, 1986). In practice, however, the ideal of perfect congruence is frequently not achieved. Phylogenies estimated from addi-tional character sets typically disagree in minor details and sometimes contain major discrepancies.When phylogeny estimates from two character sets disagree in nontrivial ways, we are confronted with a dilemma: both of the estimates cannot be correct, so how do we reconcile the differences? One explanation is that one of the data sets is simply unreliable and that no method of phylogenetic reconstruction could be expected to recover the correct tree given the poor quality of the data. At one time or another, most of us have witnessed or participated in vigorous debates about the relative strengths of alternative sources of information or about the power versus futility of particular techniques.

However, because model-based analysis under the coalescent is computationally prohibitive, a variety of inferential frameworks and corresponding algorithms have been proposed for estimation of species-level phylogenies and the associated parameters, including the speciation times and effective population sizes. Results: We consider the problem of estimating the timing of speciation events along a phylogeny in a coalescent framework. We propose a pseudolikelihood method for estimation of these speciation times under a model of DNA sequence evolution for which exact site pattern probabilities can be computed. We demonstrate that the pseudolikelihood estimates are statistically consistent and asymptotically normally distributed, and we show how this result can be used to estimate their asymptotic variance. We also provide a more computationally efficient estimator of the asymptotic variance based on the nonparametric bootstrap. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulation and by application to an empirical dataset on gibbons.",Jing Peng and David Swofford and Laura Kubatko,1,9876848469319295981,BioRxiv,,681023,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,Estimation of Speciation Times Under the Multispecies Coalescent,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/681023v1.abstract,,2019,/scholar?cites=9876848469319295981,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:cRMvf6lLvU8C

27127,"Degree: Ph. D.DegreeYear: 1986Institute: University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignNumerical approaches to phylogenetic inference under the maximum parsimony criterion are treated in five independent, but interrelated, chapters. The first examines the problem of assigning character states to hypothetical ancestral taxa under Wagner parsimony. The validity of an algorithm proposed by Farris for solving this problem is proven, but his algorithm fails to discover the existence of alternative, equally parsimonious character-state reconstructions. The importance of considering these competing hypotheses is documented, and an algorithm for obtaining all of the most parsimonious reconstructions for a given tree topology is presented. Procedures are given for resolving ambiguity through the application of ancillary criteria.",DL Swofford,0,,,,2800-2800,,"STUDIES IN NUMERICAL CLADISTICS: PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE UNDER THE PRINCIPLE OF MAXIMUM PARSIMONY (SYSTEMATICS, EVOLUTIONARY TREES).",https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=7493646,,1987,,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:ZqE1mSdD_DYC

27131,"The unrooted tree, including posterior probabilities, was inferred with MrBayes (Figure S4)[1] using the following Interpro accession numbers: Parent, IPR001093 IMPDH/GMPR; Children, IPR005990 IMPDH, IPR005993 GMPR1, IPR005994 GMPR2. Note that the nomenclature is confusing because GMPR1 includes both eukaryotic GMPR type 1 and 2. The following child entries were not included in the analysis due to unknown function: IPR005991 IMPDH-related 1 and IPR005992 IMPDH-related 2. The sequence Q9GZH3 (Caenorhabditis elegans IMPDH) was omitted from the analysis because it's position at the base of the eukaryote branch is unstable. Probably as a result of gene duplication, two IMPDH genes were found in four bacterial species: Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343 (Q5L8L9, YP_212953), Clostridium beijerincki NCIMB 8052 (Q2WME1, ZP_00910497), Listeria monocytogenes str. 4b F2365 (Q71W05, YP_012761), and Listeria welshimeri serovar 6b (YP_848315, YP_850902). IMPDH: Residues Cys319, Thr321, Arg418 and Tyr419 are conserved in all 444 sequences of IPR005990 as well as in any additional sequences from the BLAST search that grouped within this clade on a neighbor joining tree. Therefore the Arg pathway is present in all IMPDHs, as is the ability to form E-XMP*. In contrast, either Glu or Gln are observed at position 431. The tree is monophyletic for eukaryotic IMPDH, and all eukaryotic sequences (except",Donghong Min and Helen R Josephine and Hongzhi Li and Clemens Lakner and Iain S MacPherson and David Swofford and Lizbeth Hedstrom and Wei Yang,0,,,,,,Text S1,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lizbeth_Hedstrom/publication/293833502_Text_S1/links/5761a95d08ae2b8d20ed5dee.pdf,,,,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:SpPTWFSNUtQC

27135,"Gene trees are typically reconstructed solely based on a gene alignment. Algorithms that take as input a species tree in addition to the gene alignment produce more accurate gene trees, but they require accurate species trees, which are not always available. In this talk I will present our efforts to infer species trees and gene trees at the genomic scale, using probabilistic models of gene duplication, transfer, and loss. I will briefly explain how the methods work, and show results on simulated and real data. Our methods infer accurate gene and species trees, and provide new insight into genome evolution.",Michael Braun and John Kress and Guillermo Ortí and Lacey Knowles and Kevin Kocot and Ingo Ebersberger and Derrick Zwickl and David Swofford and Luay Nakhleh and Bastien Boussau,0,,,,,,Genome-Scale Phylogenetics: Analyzing the Data,http://blog.umd.edu/braunlab/files/2014/09/2014FrontiersSymposiumProgram-weeypn.pdf,,,,H1jbCPkAAAAJ:8dzOF9BpDQoC
