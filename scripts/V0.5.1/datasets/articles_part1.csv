1000,"We present an analysis of atmospheric neutrino data from a 33.0 kton yr (535-day) exposure of the Super-Kamiokande detector. The data exhibit a zenith angle dependent deficit of muon neutrinos which is inconsistent with expectations based on calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. Experimental biases and uncertainties in the prediction of neutrino fluxes and cross sections are unable to explain our observation. The data are consistent, however, with two-flavor ν μ↔ ν τ oscillations with sin 2 2 θ> 0.82 and 5× 10− 4< Δ m 2< 6× 1 0− 3 eV 2 at 90% confidence level.",Yoshiyuki Fukuda and T Hayakawa and E Ichihara and K Inoue and K Ishihara and Hirokazu Ishino and Y Itow and T Kajita and J Kameda and S Kasuga and K Kobayashi and Y Kobayashi and Yusuke Koshio and M Miura and M Nakahata and S Nakayama and A Okada and K Okumura and N Sakurai and M Shiozawa and Y Suzuki and Y Takeuchi and Y Totsuka and S Yamada and M Earl and A Habig and E Kearns and MD Messier and K Scholberg and JL Stone and LR Sulak and CW Walter and M Goldhaber and T Barszczxak and D Casper and W Gajewski and PG Halverson and J Hsu and WR Kropp and LR Price and F Reines and M Smy and HW Sobel and MR Vagins and KS Ganezer and WE Keig and RW Ellsworth and S Tasaka and JW Flanagan and A Kibayashi and JG Learned and S Matsuno and VJ Stenger and D Takemori and T Ishii and J Kanzaki and T Kobayashi and S Mine and K Nakamura and K Nishikawa and Y Oyama and A Sakai and Makoto Sakuda and O Sasaki and S Echigo and M Kohama and AT Suzuki and TJ Haines and E Blaufuss and BK Kim and R Sanford and R Svoboda and ML Chen and Z Conner and JA Goodman and GW Sullivan and J Hill and CK Jung and K Martens and C Mauger and C McGrew and E Sharkey and B Viren and C Yanagisawa and W Doki and K Miyano and H Okazawa and C Saji and M Takahata and Y Nagashima and M Takita and T Yamaguchi and M Yoshida and SB Kim and M Etoh and K Fujita and A Hasegawa and T Hasegawa and S Hatakeyama and T Iwamoto and M Koga and T Maruyama and H Ogawa and J Shirai and A Suzuki and F Tsushima and M Koshiba and M Nemoto and K Nishijima and T Futagami and Y Hayato and Y Kanaya and K Kaneyuki and Y Watanabe and D Kielczewska and RA Doyle and JS George and AL Stachyra and LL Wai and RJ Wilkes and KK Young and Super-Kamiokande Collaboration,7420,11115547895525160594,Physical Review Letters,8,1562,American Physical Society,Evidence for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.1562,81,1998
1001,"The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry–Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain.

Using data recorded in 1100 live days of the Super-Kamiokande detector, we use three complementary data samples to study the difference in zenith angle distribution due to neutral currents and matter effects.

Flocculating activity was highest at 2 weeks of incubation, regardless of harvesting methods. The degree of flocculation was different with harvesting methods and growth stages. A high pH value (pH 11) was more effective for flocculation than treatment with aluminium sulphate or a microbial flocculant, Pestan, until the third week of incubation.

Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins catalyze 5-methylcytosine (5mC) conversion to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) to mediate DNA demethylation. However, the roles of Tet proteins in the immune response are unknown. Here, we characterized the genome-wide distribution of 5hmC in CD4+ T cells and found that 5hmC marks putative regulatory elements in signature genes associated with effector cell differentiation. Moreover, Tet2 protein was recruited to 5hmC-containing regions, dependent on lineage-specific transcription factors.

The transcription factor Cdx-2 is critical in intestinal development and homeostasis, and its expression is altered in colorectal cancers. However, the regulation of the Cdx-2 gene has not been entirely elucidated. Here, we hypothesize that Cdx-2 may be a target of PTEN signaling in the intestine. Methods: The expression patterns for Cdx-2 and PTEN along wild-type mouse colon, as well as in colon tumors occurring in Pten+/− mice, were examined.

In the model of a triaxial ellipsoid star, a deformation (possibly from shear strains in the solid part (s) of the star, or from magnetic stresses) can appear as a time-varying quadrupole moment as the star rotates. The observed loss of rotational energy, known as the spin-down luminosity (given by E= IzzΩ| Ω|= 4π2Izzfrot| frot|, where Izz is the moment of inertia around the principal axis (aligned with the rotation axis), frot is the rotation frequency, and frot is the rotational frequency derivative) provides a huge reservoir of energy.

1045,"Tanshinones are a class of abietane diterpene compound isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen or Tanshen in Chinese), a well-known herb in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Since they were first identified in the 1930s, more than 40 lipophilic tanshinones and structurally related compounds have been isolated from Danshen. In recent decades, numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the isolation, identification, synthesis and pharmacology of tanshinones. In addition to the well-studied cardiovascular activities, tanshinones have been investigated more recently for their anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we update the herbal and alternative sources of tanshinones, and the pharmacokinetics of selected tanshinones. We discuss anti-cancer properties and identify critical issues for future research. Whereas previous studies have suggested anti-cancer potential of tanshinones affecting multiple cellular processes and molecular targets in cell culture models, data from in vivo potency assessment experiments in preclinical models vary greatly due to lack of uniformity of solvent vehicles and routes of administration. Chemical modifications and novel formulations had been made to address the poor oral bioavailability of tanshinones. So far, human clinical trials have been far from ideal in their design and execution for the purpose of supporting an anti-cancer indication of tanshinones.

The mechanisms underlying these pain states are poorly understood. Clinical studies have shown that gabapentin, a drug that binds to the voltage-gated calcium channel alpha-2-delta-1 subunit (Cavα2δ-1) proteins is effective in the management of SCI-induced neuropathic pain.

Considering that α-tubulin acetylation is an important factor in axonal transport and that Aβ impairs mitochondrial axonal transport, we manipulated the level of α-tubulin acetylation in hippocampal neurons with Aβ cultured in a microfluidic system and examined its effect on mitochondrial axonal transport. We found that inhibiting histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which deacetylates α-tubulin, significantly restored the velocity and motility of the mitochondria in both anterograde and retrograde axonal transports, which would be otherwise compromised by Aβ. The inhibition of HDAC6 also recovered the length of the mitochondria that had been shortened by Aβ to a normal level. These results suggest that the inhibition of HDAC6 significantly rescues hippocampal neurons from Aβ-induced impairment of mitochondrial axonal transport as well as mitochondrial length.

Here we challenge this notion and show that, instead,  the presence of a unique WW domain (WW3*) in either Nedd4-2 or Nedd4-1  determines high affinity interactions and the ability to suppress ENaC. WW3*  from either Nedd4-2 or Nedd4-1 binds ENaC-PY motifs equally well (e.g.  Kd ∼10 μm for α- or  βENaC, 3–6-fold higher affinity than WW4), as determined by  intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Moreover, dNedd4-1, which naturally  contains a WW3* instead of WW2, is able to suppress ENaC function equally well  as Nedd4-2.

1139,"Bone regeneration involves various complex biological processes. Many experiments have been performed using biomaterials in vivo and in vitro to promote and understand bone regeneration. Among the many biomaterials, calcium phosphates which exist in the natural bone have been conducted a number of studies because of its bone regenerative property. It can be directly contributed to bone regeneration process or assist in the use of other biomaterials. Therefore, it is widely used in many applications and has been continuously studied. Calcium phosphate has been widely used in bone regeneration applications because it shows osteoconductive and in some cases osteoinductive features. The release of calcium and phosphorus ions regulates the activation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts to facilitate bone regeneration. The control of surface properties and porosity of calcium phosphate affects cell/protein adhesion and growth and regulates bone mineral formation. Properties affecting bioactivity vary depending on the types of calcium phosphates such as HAP, TCP and can be utilized in various applications because of differences in ion release, solubility, stability, and mechanical strength. In order to make use of these properties, different calcium phosphates have been used together or mixed with other materials to complement their disadvantages and to highlight their advantages.

We found that embelin inhibited constitutive STAT3 activation in a variety of human cancer cell lines such as U266, DU-145, and SCC4 cells. The suppression of STAT3 was mediated through inhibition of the activation of JAK2 and c-Src. Pervanadate treatment also reversed the embelin-induced down-regulation of STAT3, suggesting the involvement of a protein tyrosine phosphatase.

In the present study, we examined that betulinic acid (BA), a triterpene from the bark of white birch, had the inhibitory effects on hypoxia-mediated activation of STAT3 in androgen independent human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.   Methodology/Principal Findings BA inhibited the protein expression and the transcriptional activities of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) under hypoxic condition. Consistently, BA blocked hypoxia-induced phosphorylation, DNA binding activity and nuclear accumulation of STAT3. In addition, BA significantly reduced cellular and secreted levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a critical angiogenic factor and a target gene of STAT3 induced under hypoxia. Furthermore, BA prevented in vitro capillary tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) maintained in conditioned medium of hypoxic PC-3 cells, implying anti-angiogenic activity of BA under hypoxic condition. Of note, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChiP) assay revealed that BA inhibited binding of HIF-1α and STAT3 to VEGF promoter. Furthermore, silencing STAT3 using siRNA transfection effectively enhanced the reduced VEGF production induced by BA treatment under hypoxia.

Attenuating ER activities by natural products is a promising strategy to decrease breast cancer risk. We recently discovered that the pyranocoumarin compound decursin and its isomer decursinol angelate (DA) have potent novel antiandrogen receptor signaling activities. Because the ER and the androgen receptor belong to the steroid receptor superfamily, we examined whether these compounds affected ER expression and signaling in breast cancer cells. We treated estrogen-dependent MCF-7 and estrogen-independent MDA MB-231 human breast cancer cells with decursin and DA, and examined cell growth, apoptosis, and ERα and ERβ expression in both cell lines – and, in particular, estrogen-stimulated signaling in the MCF-7 cells.

1179,"Cancer is the second biggest cause of death worldwide. Despite a number of studies being conducted, the effective mechanism for treating cancer has not yet been fully understood. The tumor-microenvironment such as hypoxia, low nutrients could disturb function of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to maintain cellular homeostasis, ultimately leading to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in ER, so-called ER stress. The ER stress has a close relation with cancer. ER stress initiates unfolded protein response (UPR) to re-establish ER homeostasis as an adaptive pathway in cancer. However, persistent ER stress triggers the apoptotic pathway. Therefore, blocking the adaptive pathway of ER stress or facilitating the apoptotic pathway could be an anti-cancer strategy. Recently, natural products and their derivatives have been reported to have anti-cancer effects via ER stress. Here, we address mechanisms of ER stress-mediated apoptosis and highlight strategies for cancer therapy by utilizing ER stress. Furthermore, we summarize anti-cancer activity of the natural products via ER stress in six major types of cancers globally (lung, breast, colorectal, gastric, prostate and liver cancer). This review deepens the understanding of ER stress mechanisms in major cancers as well as the suppressive impact of natural products against cancers via ER stress.

1180," Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) is a newly discovered modulator of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF‐1α) with various biological activities such as cell growth, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. Thus, in the present study, the biological mechanisms of melatonin were elucidated in association with SPHK1 pathway in PC‐3 prostate cancer cells under hypoxia. Melatonin inhibited the stability of HIF‐1α in a time‐ and concentration‐ dependent manners. Also, melatonin decreased SPHK1 activity in PC‐3 cells during hypoxia. Furthermore, melatonin suppressed AKT/glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK‐3β) signaling pathway, which stabilizes HIF‐1α via inhibition of von Hippel‐Lindau tumor suppressor protein.

In this paper, we introduce a new framework for measuring the network difference using the Gromov-Hausdorff (GH) distance, which is often used in shape analysis. In order to apply the GH distance, we define the shape of the brain network by piecing together the patches of locally connected nearest neighbors using the graph filtration. The shape of the network is then transformed to an algebraic form called the single linkage matrix.

1185,"Terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTs) function as integral regulators of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. Using biochemistry, single‐molecule, and deep sequencing techniques, we here investigate the mechanism by which human TUT7 (also known as ZCCHC6) recognizes and uridylates precursor miRNAs (pre‐miRNAs) in the absence of Lin28. We find that the overhang of a pre‐miRNA is the key structural element that is recognized by TUT7 and its paralogues, TUT4 (ZCCHC11) and TUT2 (GLD2/PAPD4). For group II pre‐miRNAs, which have a 1‐nt 3′ overhang, TUT7 restores the canonical end structure (2‐nt 3′ overhang) through mono‐uridylation, thereby promoting miRNA biogenesis. For pre‐miRNAs where the 3′ end is further recessed into the stem (as in 3′ trimmed pre‐miRNAs), TUT7 generates an oligo‐U tail that leads to degradation.

1210,"AD, a progressive irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of certain cognitive functions, behavioral disturbances, and daily living difficulties, is the most common form of dementia found among elderly individuals [1]. This disease currently affects 27 million people all over the world [2]. The prevalence rate for AD has become the third greatest threat to the elderly, only behind cardiovascular disease and cancer [3]. Although neither a consensus concerning the pathogenesis of AD nor a perfect therapy for its treatment is available, it is now well accepted that multiple factors, including apoptosis, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and the disturbance of energy metabolism homeostasis, contribute to the progression of AD [4]. Especially, the aggregation and accumulation of extracellular and intracellular Aβ play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD and result in impaired synaptic plasticity and memory [5]. As a key rate-limiting enzyme, α-, β-, and γ-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (α-, β-, and γ-secretase) initiates the formation of Aβ by producing the peptide from APP [6]. APP can be cleaved in two ways, with formation of non-toxic Aβ17–42 by α-and γ-secretases and the generation of toxic Aβ1–42 by β-and γ-secretases [7]. Therefore, inhibiting the activity of β-secretases is important for treating AD due to their role in the direct cleavage of the Aβ domain at the N-terminus in APP [8]. These changes are closely associated with tau phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway along with MAPK signaling.

1218,"In this study, we determined the cytotoxic effects of piperine, a major constituent of black and long pepper in melanoma cells. Piperine treatment inhibited the growth of SK MEL 28 and B16 F0 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. The growth inhibitory effects of piperine were mediated by cell cycle arrest of both the cell lines in G1 phase. The G1 arrest by piperine correlated with the down-regulation of cyclin D1 and induction of p21. Furthermore, this growth arrest by piperine treatment was associated with DNA damage as indicated by phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139, activation of ataxia telangiectasia and rad3-related protein (ATR) and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Pretreatment with AZD 7762, a Chk1 inhibitor not only abrogated the activation of Chk1 but also piperine mediated G1 arrest. Similarly, transfection of cells with Chk1 siRNA completely protected the cells from G1 arrest induced by piperine. Piperine treatment caused down-regulation of E2F1 and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Apoptosis induced by piperine was associated with down-regulation of XIAP, Bid (full length) and cleavage of Caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, our results showed that piperine treatment generated ROS in melanoma cells. Blocking ROS by tiron protected the cells from piperine mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

1237,"During cancer immunoediting, loss of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) in neoplasm contributes to the evasion of tumours from host immune system. Recent studies have demonstrated that most natural killer (NK) cells that are found in advanced cancers are defective, releasing the malignant MHC-I-deficient tumours from NK-cell-dependent immune control. Here, we show that a natural killer T (NKT)-cell-ligand-loaded tumour-antigen expressing antigen-presenting cell (APC)-based vaccine effectively eradicates these advanced tumours. During this process, we find that the co-expression of Tim-3 and PD-1 marks functionally exhausted NK cells in advanced tumours and that MHC-I downregulation in tumours is closely associated with the induction of NK-cell exhaustion in both tumour-bearing mice and cancer patients.

The rate of AGE-albumin synthesis in human microglial cells is markedly increased by amyloid-β exposure and oxidative stress.

1254,"Background The aim of this study is to determine anti-cancer effect of Icariside II purified from the root of Epimedium koreanum Nakai on human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line U937.   Methodology/Principal Findings Icariside II blocked the growth U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In this anti-proliferation process, this herb compound rendered the cells susceptible to apoptosis, manifested by enhanced accumulation of sub-G1 cell population and increased the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Icariside II was able to activate caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a time-dependent manner. Concurrently, the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl-xL and survivin in U937 cells, were downregulated by Icariside II. In addition, Icariside II could inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation and function and subsequently suppress the activation of Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2), the upstream activators of STAT3, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Icariside II also enhanced the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SH2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP)-1, and the addition of sodium pervanadate (a PTP inhibitor) prevented Icariside II-induced apoptosis as well as STAT3 inactivation in STAT3 positive U937 cells. Furthermore, silencing SHP-1 using its specific siRNA significantly blocked STAT3 inactivation and apoptosis induced by Icariside II in U937 cells.

In this study we determined the effect of silibinin on TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression in gastric cancer cell lines. MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression was dose-dependently increased by TNF-α in SNU216 and SNU668 gastric cancer cells. On the other hand, TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression was dose-dependently suppressed by silibinin. To verify the regulatory mechanism of silibinin on TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression, the gastric cancer cell lines were pretreated with silibinin prior to TNF-α. TNF-α-induced MMP-9 expression was inhibited by the MEK1/2 specific inhibitor, UO126. Finally, we investigated the effect of adenoviral constitutively active (CA)-MEK and CA-Akt on MMP-9 expression. The expression of MMP-9 was significantly increased by CA-MEK overexpression, but not by CA-Akt overexpression.

Brassinosteroids (BRs), plant growth‐promoting steroid hormones, are essential for this plasticity of development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying BR‐mediated growth under different light conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that darkness increases the activity of the BR‐specific transcription factor, BZR1, by decreasing the phosphorylated (inactive) form of BZR1 in a proteasome‐dependent manner. We observed that COP1, a dark‐activated ubiquitin ligase, captures and degrades the inactive form of BZR1. In support of this, BZR1 is abundant in the cop1‐4 mutant.

Hence, a colocated detector pair is more sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a noncolocated detector pair.

1333,"Loss-of-function mutations in PINK1 and PARKIN are the most common causes of autosomal recessive Parkinson’s disease (PD). PINK1 is a mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase that plays a critical role in mitophagy, a selective autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria. Accumulating evidence suggests mitochondrial dysfunction is one of central mechanisms underlying PD pathogenesis. Therefore, identifying regulatory mechanisms of PINK1 expression may provide novel therapeutic opportunities for PD. Although post-translational stabilization of PINK1 upon mitochondrial damage has been extensively studied, little is known about the regulation mechanism of PINK1 at the transcriptional or translational levels. Here, we demonstrated that microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and miR-27b suppress PINK1 expression at the translational level through directly binding to the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR) of its mRNA. Importantly, our data demonstrated that translation of PINK1 is critical for its accumulation upon mitochondrial damage. The accumulation of PINK1 upon mitochondrial damage was strongly regulated by expression levels of miR-27a and miR-27b. miR-27a and miR-27b prevent mitophagic influx by suppressing PINK1 expression, as evidenced by the decrease of ubiquitin phosphorylation, Parkin translocation, and LC3-II accumulation in damaged mitochondria.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone on the Janus activated kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling during apoptotic process. We found that both tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone induced apoptosis by activation of caspase-9/3 and Sub-G1 accumulation in K562 cells.

In this paper, the overall helicopter dynamics is derived and a hovering model is linearized and transformed into a state-space form. However, since it is difficult to obtain parameters for stability derivatives in the state-space directly, a linear control model is derived by a time-domain parametric system identification method with real flight data of a model helicopter. Then, two different controllers (a linear feedback controller with the proportional gain and a robust controller) are designed and their performances are compared. The simulation results show outstanding performance.

Methodology/Principal Findings We showed that PO (IC50 = 17.3 µg/ml) significantly inhibited bFGF-induced cell proliferation, which was achieved with higher concentrations of paeonol (IC50 over 200 µg). The treatment with PO blocked bFGF-stimulated migration and in vitro capillary differentiation (tube formation) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, PO was able to disrupt neovascularization in vivo. Interestingly, PO (25 µg/ml) decreased the cell viability of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells but not that of HUVECs. The treatment with PO at 12.5 µg/ml reduced the levels of phosphorylated AKT and VEGF expression (intracellular and extracelluar) in HT-1080 cells. Consistently, immunefluorescence imaging analysis revealed that PO treatment attenuated AKT phosphorylation in HT-1080 cells.

The results also show that both the crystal quality and optical properties are improved in GaN on CSPS with a strong spatial correlation between the dark spots and local structural properties due to the induced-lateral overgrowth on the cone-shaped patterns.,Kyu-Seung Lee and Ho-Sang Kwack and Jun-Seok Hwang and Tae-Moo Roh and Yong-Hoon Cho and Jae-Hoon Lee and Yong-Chun Kim and Chang Soo Kim,42,14239680942727913507,Journal of Applied Physics,10,103506,American Institute of Physics,Spatial correlation between optical properties and defect formation in GaN thin films laterally overgrown on cone-shaped patterned sapphire substrates,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.3388014,107,2010

1384,"Since the dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis is closely associated with tumor progression, in the current study, the critical role of ribosome biogenesis related signaling was investigated in melatonin and/or puromycin induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Despite its weak cytotoxicity, melatonin from 3 mM attenuated the expression of 45S pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA), UBF as a nucleolar transcription factor, and fibrillarin at mRNA level and consistently downregulated nucleolar proteins such as UBF and fibrillarin at protein level in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assay revealed that UBF was also degraded by melatonin in MDA-MB-231 cells. In contrast, melatonin attenuated the expression of survival genes such as Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, cyclinD1, and cyclin E, suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and STAT3, and cleaved PARP and activated caspase 3 only at a high concentration of 12 mM.

Physiological lipid membranes are composed of multiple types of phospholipids, and the leaflet compositions are generally asymmetric. Here we describe an approach for self-assembly of a Coarse-Grained (CG) membrane model with physiological composition and leaflet asymmetry using the MARTINI force field. An initial set-up of two boxes with different types of lipids according to the leaflet asymmetry of mammalian cell membranes stacked with 0.5 nm overlap, reliably resulted in the self-assembly of bilayer membranes with leaflet asymmetry resembling that of physiological mammalian cell membranes. Self-assembly in the presence of a fragment of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 1A led to spontaneous specific positioning of phosphatidylionositol(4,5)bisphosphate at a positively charged stretch of syntaxin consistent with experimental data. An analogous approach choosing an initial set-up with two concentric shells filled with different lipid types results in successful assembly of a spherical vesicle with asymmetric leaflet composition. Self-assembly of the vesicle in the presence of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin 2 revealed the correct position of the synaptobrevin transmembrane domain.

The data used in this paper were produced during LIGO’s fifth science run (S5) that started on November 4, 2005 and ended on October 1, 2007.Spinning neutron stars are promising sources of GW signals in the LIGO frequency band. These objects may generate continuous GWs through a variety of mechanisms including non-axisymmetric distortions of the neutron star, unstable oscillation modes in the fluid part of the star and free precession [2–6]. Independently of the specific mechanism, the emitted signal is a quasi-periodic wave whose frequency changes slowly during the observation time due to energy loss through GW emission, and possibly other mechanisms.

1400,"The anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA) were investigated on the inflammatory cells and the dopaminergic degeneration in mice. TCA inhibited the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory BV2 microglial cells. To investigate the TCA efficacy on the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced dopaminergic degeneration in mice, an intracerebroventricular injection of 6-OHDA was given to the mice, and TCA (30 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered. At 7 d after the 6-OHDA injection, 6-OHDA led to a severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and substantia nigra (SN). On the other hand, TCA dramatically maintained the number of TH-positive dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and SN regions of the 6-OHDA-treated mice, which indicates that TCA is able to inhibit the 6-OHDA-induced reduction of TH expression in the dopaminergic neurons in the striatum and SN regions. TCA also inhibited the induction of iNOS and COX-2 in the 6-OHDA model, similarly as shown in the LPS-induced inflammatory BV2 microglial cells. These results indicate that TCA has a neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons and that this effect may be associated with the inhibition of inflammatory responses.

1423,"The binding of interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family ligands to the gp130 receptor complex activates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signal transduction pathway, where STAT3 plays an important role in cell survival and tumorigenesis. Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been frequently observed in many cancer tissues, and thus, blocking of the gp130 signaling pathway, at the JAK level, might be a useful therapeutic approach for the suppression of STAT3 activity, as anticancer therapy. AG490 is a tyrphostin tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been extensively used for inhibiting JAK2 in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism associated with AG490 that inhibits the JAK/STAT3 pathway. AG490 induced downregulation of gp130, a common receptor for the IL-6 cytokine family compounds, but not JAK2 or STAT3, within three hours of exposure. The downregulation of gp130 was not caused by enhanced degradation of gp130 or by inhibition of mRNA transcription. It most likely occurred by translation inhibition of gp130 in association with phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2α. The inhibition of protein synthesis of gp130 by AG490 led to immediate loss of mature gp130 in cell membranes, due to its short half-life, thereby resulting in reduction in the STAT3 response to IL-6. Taken together, these results suggest that AG490 blocks the STAT3 activation pathway via a novel pathway.",In Seo and Hyun Kyoung Lee and Yoon Kyung Shin and Sang Hwa Lee and Su-Yeong Seo and Ji Wook Park and Hwan Tae Park,37,17469932930605676446,The Korean Journal of Physiology & Pharmacology,2,131-138,,Janus kinase 2 inhibitor AG490 inhibits the STAT3 signaling pathway by suppressing protein translation of gp130,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17469932930605676446&hl=en&oi=scholarr,13,2009

Here we show that NORE1 induces polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of oncoprotein HIPK1 by facilitating its interaction with the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Endogenous HIPK1 is stabilized in Nore1‐deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and depletion of HIPK1 in NORE1‐silenced lung adenocarcinoma cells inhibits anchorage‐independent cell growth and tumour formation in nude mice.

The ethanol extract of PSA (200mg/kg) significantly inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in vivo, and suppressed the release of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. It was also found that PSA decreased the expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in PMA-and A23187-stimulated HMC-1 cells. The results show the inactivation of IkappaB-alpha and NF-kappaB, as well as suppression of the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK).

An eddy current sensor and a laser displacement sensor are used to measure the loading on the working wheel surface and the topography of the dressed wheel surface respectively. The dressing interval can be decided properly through the relational locus between the level of loading and the machined surface roughness. An optimal dressing depth to ensure less wheel loss and greater wheel surface quality is decided through the analysis of the variance of topography for the dressed wheel surface, which decreases at three different rates according to the accumulated dressing depth.",SunHo Kim and Jung Hwan Ahn,30,1069993816979872131,Journal of Materials Processing Technology,1-3,190-194,Elsevier,Decision of dressing interval and depth by the direct measurement of the grinding wheel surface,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092401369800394X,88,1999

1547,"Here, antitumor mechanism of cinnamaldehyde derivative CB-PIC was elucidated in human SW620 colon cancer cells. CB-PIC significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased sub-G1 accumulation, and cleaved PARP with apoptotic features, while it enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK alpha and ACC as well as activated the ERK in hypoxic SW620 cells. Furthermore, CB-PIC suppressed the expression of HIF1 alpha, Akt, and mTOR and activated the AMPK phosphorylation in hypoxic SW620 cells. Conversely, silencing of AMPKα blocked PARP cleavage and ERK activation induced by CB-PIC, while ERK inhibitor PD 98059 attenuated the phosphorylation of AMPKα in hypoxic SW620 cells, implying cross-talk between ERK and AMPKα. Furthermore, cotreatment of CB-PIC and metformin enhanced the inhibition of HIF1α and Akt/mTOR and the activation of AMPKα and pACC in hypoxic SW620 cells. In addition, CB-PIC suppressed the growth of SW620 cells inoculated in BALB/c athymic nude mice, and immunohistochemistry revealed that CB-PIC treatment attenuated the expression of Ki-67, CD34, and CAIX and increased the expression of pAMPKα in CB-PIC-treated group. Interestingly, CP-PIC showed better antitumor activity in SW620 colon cancer cells under hypoxia than under normoxia, since it may be applied to chemoresistance.

Using several myelogenous cell lines, the effect of genipin (an active compound of Gardenia fruit) on the STAT3 pathway and apoptosis was investigated. Genipin suppressed the constitutive STAT3 activation in U266 and U937 cells and stimulated Src homology 2 domain‐containing phosphatase 1 (SHP‐1), which dephosphorylates and inactivates STAT3. Specifically, genipin blocked STAT3 activation via repressing the activation of c‐Src, but not Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). Genipin also downregulated the expression of STAT3 target genes including Bcl‐2, Bcl‐xL, Survivin, Cyclin D1, and VEGF.

Thirty male db/db mice were divided into three groups. Group 1 were fed AIN-93G ad libitum; group 2 were fed AIN-93G mixed with 10% fermented CSVA ad libitum; group 3 were fed AIN-93G mixed with 10% non-fermented CSVA ad libitum. The mice were sacrificed 14 weeks later, and the serum glucose level, 24-hour urine chemistry, and morphological changes in the kidneys were examined.ResultsAs CSVA concentrations increased, viable MDCK cells increased in concentration. MDA production decreased over time in the CSVA treated group. The creatinine clearance of group 3 was lower than those of groups 1 and 2. The amount of urine microalbumin and protein in group 1 were higher than those in groups 2 and 3.

Here in this study, we isolated protocatechuic acid (PCA) from V. peregrina and examined PCAs effects on the lifespan and stress tolerance using Caenorhabditis elegans model system. We found that lifespan of wild-type worms was significantly lengthened in the presence of PCA in a dose dependent manner. PCA also elevated tolerance of worms against osmotic, heat shock, and oxidative stress. We also demonstrated antioxidant capacity of PCA by checking intracellular reactive oxygen species level and antioxidant enzyme activities such as catalase and superoxide dismutase.

1596,"Aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanisms of tanshinone IIA-induced apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. Cytotoxicity of tanshinone IIA was evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Our data demonstrate that tanshinone IIA induced apoptosis by increasing the sub-G1 DNA contents and DNA fragmentation in KBM-5 CML cell line. In addition, tanshinone IIA significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activated caspase-3 and 9, indicating mitochondria-dependent apoptosis by tanshinone IIA. Tanshinone IIA attenuated expression of several apoptosis-related proteins such as c-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) 2, Mcl-1L and Bcl-2. Interestingly, although tanshinone IIA notably enhanced the phosphorylation of both c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38, JNK inhibitor, but not p38 inhibitor, reversed tanshinone IIA-induced apoptosis.

1641,"Mirodenafil (SK3530) is a new potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that mirodenafil is an effective treatment for erectile dysfunction. Its mechanism of action is enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) induced cGMP formation resulting in significant relaxation of the corpus cavernosum (CC). The aim of this study was to investigate the oral efficacy of mirodenafil in an acute spinal cord-injured rabbit model. Mirodenafil or sildenafil citrate was given orally to male rabbits with a surgical transection of the spinal cord at the L2-L4 lumbar vertebra or ischemic-reperfusion spinal cord injury (SCI). Erections were evaluated in a time-course manner by measuring the length of the uncovered penile mucosa. In the transection SCI model, penile erections were induced at 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg of mirodenafil but sildenafil only showed an erectile response at 3 mg/kg. The effects of 1 and 3 mg/kg of mirodenafil were significantly increased by intravenous injection of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide donor. In the ischemic-reperfusion injury model, 3 mg/kg of either mirodenafil or sildenafil produced a penile erection response. After injection of SNP, the lengths of immediate penile erections were significantly increased in the 1 and 3 mg/kg mirodenafil and 3 mg/kg sildenafil groups. The onset of erectile activity was faster with mirodenafil than with sildenafil citrate.

Although RAGE does not have any kinase motifs in its cytosolic domain, the interaction between RAGE and Aβ triggers multiple cellular signaling involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism of signal transduction by RAGE remains still unknown. Therefore, identifying binding proteins of RAGE may provide novel therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, we identified p38-regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK) as a novel RAGE interacting molecule. To investigate the effect of Aβ on PRAK mediated RAGE signaling pathway, we treated SH-SY5Y cells with monomeric form of Aβ. We demonstrated that Aβ significantly increased the phosphorylation of PRAK as well as the interaction between PRAK and RAGE. We showed that knockdown of PRAK rescued mTORC1 inactivation induced by Aβ treatment and decreased the formation of Aβ-induced autophagosome.

We identified all three isoforms of Ca2+‐activated small conductance K+ (SK) channels in the murine SAN. SK channel blockade slows repolarization and subsequent depolarization of SAN cells. In the atrial‐specific Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) knockout mouse, cellular Ca2+ accumulation during spontaneous SAN pacemaker activity produces intermittent hyperactivation of SK channels, leading to arrhythmic pauses alternating with bursts of pacing.

1682,Ephedrae Herba (EH) is obtained by drying the stems of Ephedra sinica Stapf (family Ephedraceae). EH has been used clinically to treat colds and to reduce edema in skin. The effects of EH on melanogenesis were studied in B16 murine melanocytes. The tyrosinase activity and melanin content were measured after incubation with EH. Both reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction and cDNA microarray analysis were used to study the mechanism of EH action. EH decreased tyrosinase activity and melanin content in a dose‐dependent manner. EH decreased microphthalmia‐associated transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase gene expression. These effects were controlled by MITF‐mediated regulation of tyrosinase gene expression. EH also altered the expression of about 100 other genes.

The width of the middle portion of a detection area in a magnetoresistive layer is thicker than that of shoulder portions. In the magnetoresistive device, the shoulder portions, which perform exchange coupling with the antiferromagnetic exchange layer, show a weak reaction to external magnetic field due to the high coercive force of the shoulder portions and a smaller thickness of the magnetoresistive layer than that of the detection area. Thus, when information on any one track of an information medium is read out through the detection area, the shoulder portions only slightly react to the external magnetic field of the adjacent tracks, ie, the affect on the detection area by the shoulder portions is minimized.",,19,2081021808902565764,,,,,Magnetoresistive device and manufacturing method thereof,https://patents.google.com/patent/US5753131A/en,,1998

Thus, in the present study, the apoptotic mechanism of ursolic acid was elucidated in HCT116 and HT29 colorectal cancer cells in association with STAT3 and microRNA-4500 (miR-4500) by MTT assay, Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay, cell cycle analysis, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting. Ursolic acid significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased TUNEL positive cells and sub-G1 apoptotic portion, induced cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase 3 in HCT116 and HT29 cells. Of note, ursolic acid attenuated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and also blocked nuclear translocation of STAT3 in colorectal cancer cells. Notably, ursolic acid increased the expression level of miR-4500 in HCT116 cells by qRT-PCR analysis and conversely miR-4500 inhibitor reversed cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and apoptotic effects by increasing TUNEL positive cells, PARP cleavage and inhibiting p-STAT3 in ursolic acid treated colorectal cancer cells.

1709,"This paper presents a digital control scheme for a UPS inverter system. The inverter provides a near sinusoidal output voltage waveform with low harmonic distortion factor and must be controlled with very fast dynamic response and robustness to load changes or parameter variations. The proposed scheme is based on the current regulated voltage controller. The filter inductor current is forced to follow the current command calculated from the desired capacitor voltage and the sensed output load current. Clearly, the sensed output current signal acts as a disturbance feedforward signal which leads to a fast dynamic response of the controller to sudden changes of output load current. In order to guarantee the robustness of the system, a PI capacitor voltage controller is added as in the conventional double feedback loop controller. The natural problems of this controller, i.e. the phase difference between the output …",Byoung-Jin Kim and Jae-Ho Choi and Jae-Sik Kim and Chang-Ho Choi,18,6850944967359438917,,,318-321,IEEE,Digital control scheme of UPS inverter to improve the dynamic response,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/548101/,1,1996

1711,"Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen with efficacy in treatment of both estrogen receptor-positive and negative breast tumors, may be immunomodulatory. We tested tamoxifen's ability to augment the antitumor activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a lymphokine capable of expanding and activating lymphocytes, in the treatment of established pulmonary metastases of the weakly immunogenic murine fibrosarcoma MCA-106. Age-matched C57BL/6 female mice bearing pulmonary metastases induced by a tail vein injection of MCA-106 tumor suspension (5 x 10 (5) cells/mouse) were treated from days 3 through 12 with intraperitoneal saline solution or IL-2 (50,000 units twice a day). Half of the mice in each group received plain and the remainder received tamoxifen-treated (2 units/ml) drinking water ad libitum for the duration of the experiment. All mice were killed on day 18 for enumeration of pulmonary metastases. Compared with saline-treated control mice, IL-2 and tamoxifen reduced metastases by 66%(p less than 0.0002) and 30%(p less than 0.005), respectively. IL-2 and tamoxifen combined reduced metastases 95%(p less than 0.0002), significantly better than did IL-2 (p less than 0.02) or tamoxifen (p less than 0.0003) alone. In vitro, tamoxifen inhibited proliferation of the weakly estrogen receptor-positive MCA-106 tumor by approximately 30%. Tamoxifen had no effect on the generation of 3-day IL-2-activated lymphocyte cytotoxicity against both natural killer-sensitive (YAC) and natural killer-resistant (MCA-106) target cells.

1713,"Background How short-term blood pressure variability (BPV) is affected in the acute stage of ischemic stroke and whether BPV is associated with early neurologic outcomes remains unclear.   Methods Patients who admitted for ischemic stroke within 24 h of symptom onset were consecutively identified between January 2010 and January 2015. BP profiles measured in real-time were summarized into short-term, 24-h time intervals, based on standard deviation (SD) and mean of systolic BP (SBPSD) during the first 3 days. The primary outcome was daily assessment of early neurological deterioration (END). The associations between short-term SBPSD values and the secular trend for primary outcome were examined.   Results A total of 2,545 subjects (mean age, 67.1 ± 13.5 years old and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 3) arrived at the hospital an average of 6.1 ± 6.6 h after symptom onset. SBPSD values at day 1 (SD#D1), SD#D2, and SD#D3 were 14.4 ± 5.0, 12.5 ± 4.5, and 12.2 ± 4.6 mmHg, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that SD#D2 was independently associated with onset of END at day 2 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.13), and SD#D3 was independently associated with END#D3 (1.07, 1.01–1.14), with adjustments for predetermined covariates, SBPmean, and interactions with daily SBPSD.

1714,"The molecular mechanisms that govern differential T cell development into pro-inflammatory Th17 vs. regulatory T (Treg) cells remain unclear. Here, we show that selective deletion of CREB in T cells or Th17 cells impaired Th17 cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo, and led to resistance to autoimmune diseases. Mechanistically, CREB, activated by CD3-PKC-ϴ signaling, plays a key role in regulating Th17 cell differentiation, at least in part through directly binding to the Il17-Il17f gene locus. Unexpectedly, although dispensable for FOXP3 expression and for the homeostasis and suppressive function of thymus-derived Treg cells, CREB negatively regulates the survival of TGF-β-induced Treg cells, and deletion of CREB resulted in increased FOXP3 + Treg cells in the intestine and protection in a colitis model.

Here, we investigated the contribution of Th17 responses to host defense against intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and found that Th17 cell generation was suppressed in this model. Unexpectedly, mice lacking both p35 and EBI3 cleared L. monocytogenes as efficiently as wild-type mice, whereas p35-deficient mice failed to do so. Furthermore, both innate cells and pathogen-specific T cells from double-deficient mice produced significantly higher IL-17 and IL-22 compared to wild-type mice. The bacterial burden in the liver of double-deficient mice treated with anti-IL-17 was significantly increased compared to those receiving a control Ab. Transfer of Th17 cells specific for listeriolysin O as well as administration of IL-17 and IL-22 significantly suppressed bacterial growth in p35-deficient mice, indicating the critical contribution of Th17 responses to host defense against the intracellular pathogen in the absence of IL-12 and proper Th1 responses.

It was found that the blue emission using the InN/GaN MQW results in high emission efficiency and an increase in the activation energy, which are ascribed to the strong carrier localization in the nanostructures. In addition, these nanostructures could effectively eliminate the quantum confined stark effect by relaxing the strain by nanostructure formation.",Hyung Koun Cho and Dong Chan Kim and Bo Hyun Kong and Kyu Han Lee and Jeong Tak Oh and Sunwoon Kim and Dong Jun Kim and Je Won Kim and Soon Ku Hong,17,10218589336561983486,Journal of crystal growth,2-4,349-354,North-Holland,Nanostructure formation and emission characterization of blue emission InN/GaN quantum well with thin InN well layers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022024805005324,281,2005

The Al composition in the solid was affected by the gas-phase parasitic reaction between NH3 and trimethylaluminum (TMAl). As the operating pressure decreased, the Al composition in the solid increased over the ideal incorporation efficiency. This is due to a scavenging effect and a site-blocking effect. As the TMAl flow rate increased with fixed flow rates of NH3 and trimethylgallium (TMGa), the Al concentration in the solid increased but started to saturate.

The introduction of assistance current from anode connections, which ameliorated the electron depletion in the MFCs, immediately eliminated the power overshoot. As a result, if the electron production at the anode exceeded electron reduction at the cathode, a power overshoot was not generated.

In this study, we investigated the effect of DEHP on the synthesis and metabolism of arachidonic acid (AA), a precursor of eicosanoids, in the testis of prepubertal rats. DEHP (100 and 1,000 mg/kg, 5 days) admini stration caused a significant reduction in activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the AA and eicosanoid synthesis pathways. DEHP increased the expression of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) in rat testis, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was not altered. Cytochrome P450 4A1 (CYP4A1), a product of a PPARα-regulated gene, was markedly increased in the testis by DEHP administration. Taken together, DEHP suppresses cPLA2 activity and induces the AA metabolizing enzymes such as 12-LOX and CYP4A1, resulting in the reduction of AA level. These data suggest that altered AA metabolic cascades may be related to the decrease of testosterone concentration in DEHP-induced testicular atrophy.",Hyung-Sub KIM and Mayumi ISHIZUKA and Akio KAZUSAKA and Shoichi FUJITA,16,5172933711205261249,Journal of veterinary medical science,9,1119-1124,Japanese Society of Veterinary Science,Alterations of activities of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and arachidonic acid-metabolizing enzymes in di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate-induced testicular atrophy,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jvms/66/9/66_9_1119/_article/-char/ja/,66,2004

Because the majority of patients have metastatic disease either at presentation or later, the development of systemic chemotherapeutic treatments is mandatory to improve clinical outcome for patients with gastric carcinoma. Given the predominantly palliative intent of advanced gastric carcinoma therapies, regimens with both low toxicity and acceptable activity should be chosen for patients in this category.[2]During the past decade, the development of new regimens that may represent a step forward in the treatment of advanced gastric carcinoma encouraged the medical community.

This comparison demonstrates that self-recovering voltage reversals are caused by temporary damage to, and the recovery of, biofilm capacitance which arises due to the ability of redox enzymes in the electron transfer system to temporarily store electrons. Thus, the development of procedures for voltage reversal control and for the maintenance of serially connected microbial fuel cells (MFCs) should take into account such temporary voltage reversal phenomenon. This discovery and characterization of self-recovering voltage reversals is expected to be practically useful to enhance the reliability of MFCs to be scaled up and implemented in practical systems.",Bongkyu Kim and Serah Choi and Jae Kyung Jang and In Seop Chang,14,6471199890097060519,Bioresource technology,,1286-1289,Elsevier,Self-recoverable voltage reversal in stacked microbial fuel cells due to biofilm capacitance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852417314773,245,2017

RCF inhibited compound 48/80-induced systemic reactions in mice. RCF attenuated immunoglobulin (Ig) E-mediated local allergic reactions. In addition, RCF dependently reduced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells local allergic reactions. In addition, RCF dependently reduced histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells activated by compound 48/80 or IgE. Furthermore, RCF decreased the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated tumor necrosis factor  and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion in human mast cells.

1824,"A furocoumarin derivative, psoralen (7H-furo[3,2-g][1]benzopyran-7-one), was isolated from the n-hexane fraction ofHeracleum moellendorffii Hance. We examined the effects of psoralen on a human Kv1.5 potassium channel (hKv1.5) cloned from human heart and stably expressed in Ltk cells. We found that psoralen inhibited the hKv1.5 current in a concentration-,use- and voltage-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 180 ± 21 nM at +60 mV. Psoralen accelerated the inactivation kinetics of the hKv1.5 channel, and it slowed the deactivation kinetics of the hKv1.5 current resulting in a tail crossover phenomenon. These results indicate that psoralen acts on the hKv1.5 channel as an open channel blocker. Furthermore, psoralen prolonged the action potential duration of rat atrial muscles in a dose-dependent manner.

Studies have shown that oncogenic ras is not only able to promote cell growth or survival, but also apoptosis, depending upon circumstances. Using pancreatic cancer cell lines with or without expressing mutated K-ras, we demonstrated that the inhibition of endogenous PKC activity sensitized human pancreatic cancer cells (MIA and PANC-1) expressing mutated K-ras to apoptosis, which had no apoptotic effect on BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells that contain a normal Ras as well as human lung epithelial BAES-2B cells. In this apoptotic process, the level of ROS was increased and PUMA was upregulated in a p73-dependent fashion in MIA and PANC-1 cells. Subsequently, caspase-3 was cleaved. A full induction of apoptosis required the activation of both ROS- and p73-mediated pathways. The data suggest that PKC is a crucial factor that copes with aberrant K-ras to maintain the homeostasis of the pancreatic cancer cells harboring mutated K-ras.

The dual port semiconductor memory device includes two PMOS transistors, two NMOS pull-down transistors, two NMOS pass transistors, and a PMOS scan transistor. The scan transistor being PMOS, noise margins can be improved. In addition, these seven transistors are arranged in two n-wells and 2 p-wells, while n-wells and p-wells are arranged in series and in alternating fashion. Therefore, the length of a memory cell along the minor axis of the memory cell is relatively short. This memory cell layout helps shorten the length of a bit line by arranging a pair of bitlines in parallel with well boundaries, ie, in the direction of the short axis of the memory cell, and makes it possible to prevent crosstalk between a bitline and a complementary bitline by arranging conductive lines between the bitline and the complementary bitline.",,13,6272386956066937959,,,,,Dual port semiconductor memory device,https://patents.google.com/patent/US7120080B2/en,,2006

1856,"Realistic motions of articulated bodies are usually generated by using physically-based animation methods such as constrained dynamics. However, these methods involve heavy computations and complicated numerical methods. We present an alternative way of solving constraints of articulated bodies. Our objective is not physically correct motions but visually plausible animation. In our method, each object of the constrained body is first moved according to their physical parameters and external forces, without considering any constraints. Then the objects are translated and rotated to satisfy the given constraints. Instead of strict simulation of physical laws, we suggest procedural formulations for solving constraints. This formulation has the power of generating visually plausible motions as presented in our example animation sequences. Since our method is free from complex numerical methods, it is fast enough to be used in real-time applications such as virtual reality, computer games and real-time simulations. Numerical stability is another merit of our method.

The previous work on this area mainly focused on designing a control law to locate the closed loop eigenvalues in a specified region. In the aspect of robust performance, it is desirable that the region where the eigenvalues of the uncertain systems exist is as small as possible, because the performances of two systems with severely separated eigenvalues are much different to each other. To maintain the robust performance in this manner, the design method of this paper, first, provides the smallest circular region which can include the closed loop eigenvalues. Second, it also provides a linear state feedback which locates the eigenvalues in that region. The quadratic d-stabilizability concept is used for deriving the formulas in this paper.

The inhibitory effects were antagonized by a Ca2+ channel activator, 100 nM Bay k8644, and by a high concentration of Ca2+ (6.5 mM). Ultraviolet light, which has been shown to decompose dihydropyridines, attenuated the effects of nisoldipine. After nisoldipine had been removed from muscle bath, the inhibitory effect faded away slowly. The residual inhibitory effects on [Ca2+]i and muscle tension were antagonized by Bay k8644, high Ca2+ and ultraviolet light. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of nisoldipine is caused by a decrease in [Ca2+]i as a result of inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels, and that the residual inhibitory effects are caused …",Bo Kyung Kim and Minori Mitsui and Hideaki Karaki,12,15581953715715427224,European journal of pharmacology,2-3,157-162,Elsevier,"The long-term inhibitory effect of a Ca2+ channel blocker, nisoldipine, on cytosolic Ca2+ and contraction in vascular smooth muscle",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001429999294834I,223,1992

1898,"Expression of ectonucleotidase CD39 contributes to the suppressive activity of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) by hydrolyzing immunogenic ATP into AMP. The molecular mechanism that drives CD39 expression on Tregs remains elusive. We found that tumor-infiltrating Tregs (Ti-Tregs) failed to up-regulate CD39 in mice lacking EBI3 subunit of IL-27 or IL-27Ra. Mixed bone marrow chimera and in vitro studies showed that IL-27 signaling in Tregs directly drives CD39 expression on Ti-Tregs in a STAT1-dependent, but STAT3- and T-bet–independent, manner. Tregs stimulated with IL-27 showed enhanced suppressive activities against CD8+ T cell responses in vitro. Moreover, IL-27Ra–deficient Tregs and STAT1-deficient Tregs were less efficient than WT Tregs in suppressing antitumor immunity in vivo. CD39 inhibition significantly abolished IL-27–induced suppressive activities of Tregs.

1899,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, joint-invading, autoimmune inflammatory disease, which causes joint cartilage breakdown and bone damage, resulting in functional impairment and deformation of the joints. The percentage of RA patients has been rising and RA represents a substantial burden for patients around the world. Despite the development of many RA therapies, because of the side effects and low effectiveness of conventional drugs, patients still need and researchers are seeking new therapeutic alternatives. Polyphenols extracted from natural products are effective on several inflammatory diseases, including RA. In this review polyphenols are classified into four types: flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes and others, among which mainly flavonoids are discussed. Researchers have reported that anti-RA efficacies of polyphenols are based mainly on three mechanisms: their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and apoptotic properties. The main RA factors modified by polyphenols are mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor κ light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Polyphenols could be potent alternative RA therapies and sources for novel drugs for RA by affecting its key mechanisms.

The performance of the biofilm was shown, using discharge test and cyclic voltammetry investigations, to improve over time. Differential pulse voltammograms were also acquired to determine the type of extracellular electron transfer that took place and to characterize the structure of the microbial biofilm formed on the electrode of the electrochemical system. These results indicated that extracellular electron transfer via a flavin-like mediator chemical predominated as the biofilm grew.

The aim of this present study was to elucidate the anti-amnestic effect of ODH. ODH pretreatment significantly reduced escape latency of scopolamine treated Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice compared to untreated control groups in a Morris water maze test. Similarly, the passive avoidance test showed that ODH treatment recovered the scopolamine induced amnesia in the ICR mouse model. Concentration of Ach in brains of ODH treated mice was increased compared to that of scopolamine treated mice. In addition, activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was notably decreased by ODH. The protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB)(Ser133) was increased in ODH pretreated group compared to control group. Consistently, immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the elevated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and p-CREB in brains of ODH treated mice compared to the control group. Overall, these findings suggest that ODH has anti-amnestic potential via activation of BDNF and p-CREB and inhibition of AChE in mice with scopolamine induced amnesia.

1920,"Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) can activate signaling via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) leading to dynamic regulation of cellular morphology. Mechanistic basis for the lack of effective intracellular signaling by non-attached epithelial cells is poorly understood. To examine whether signaling in suspended cells is regulated by Fer cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, we investigated the effect of ectopic Fer expression on signaling in suspended or adherent hepatocytes.

Although recent research has demonstrated its anticancer effects in several cancer cells, it is still unclear whether MA inhibits the migratory ability of lung cancer cells. The present study investigated the effects of MA on the migration of lung cancer cells and explored the underlying mechanism. Results from a transwell assay and wound-healing assay demonstrated that methylene chloride extracts of MA (MEMA) suppressed the migration and invasion of H1299, H460, and A549 human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Results from Western blot analyses showed that MEMA reduced the phosphorylation of STAT3 and Src. In addition, MEMA downregulated the expression of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins including Slug, Snail, Vimentin, and N-cadherin, while upregulating the expression of Occludin—a tight-junction protein. The regulation of EMT markers and the decrease of migration by MEMA treatment were reversed once phospho-mimetic STAT3 (Y705D) or Src (Y527F) was transfected into H1299 cells.

Thus, allergen-free R. verniciflua extracts are currently being marketed as a functional health food in Korea. In the present study, three different allergen-free R. verniciflua extracts (DRVE, FRVE, and FFRVE) were produced by detoxification of R. verniciflua, and their properties and constituents were compared. The main components and properties (antibacterial, antioxidant, anticancer, and hepatic lipogenesis inhibitory effects) of the three allergen-free extracts were compared. Moreover, the major phenolic constituents of R. verniciflua, including gallic acid, fustin, fisetin, and quercetin, were analyzed in the three extracts. DRVE was superior to the two other extracts with regard to antioxidant activity, while FRVE was superior with regard to antimicrobial activity and suppression of hepatic lipogenesis. FRVE exhibited lipid-lowering effects by lowering sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and triglyceride levels, and promoting the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and AMP-activated protein kinase in an in vitro model of non-alcoholic fatty liver.

1942,"Electrode properties determine the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) performance of fuel cells and are influenced by the materials and processing. A high-performance electrode requires good adhesion between the membrane and catalyst, excellent gas permeability, and good ion conduction. Here, sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPAES) containing a bulky spirobiindane (Spiro) group is proposed as a new hydrocarbon electrode binder for MEAs. The effect of the Spiro group on MEA performance was compared to that of the common biphenylsulfone. The structural differences between the two binders affected the mass transport region of the current-voltage polarization (related to gas permeation).

1943,"Though Dehydrocorydaline, an alkaloid isolated from Corydalis turtschaninovii tuber, was known to have anti‐coronary artery disease, anti‐inflammatory, apoptotic, anti‐allergic, anti‐acetylcholinesterase, and antitumor effects, the underlying anti‐metastatic mechanism of Dehydrocorydalin was never elucidated in lung cancer cells so far. Thus, in the present study, the anti‐metastatic effect of Dehydrocorydaline was examined in non‐small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells, mainly targeting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and B cell lymphoma‐2 (Bcl‐2) signaling. Here, Dehydrocorydaline exerted weak cytotoxicity and attenuated the protein expression of Bcl‐2 and activated Bax in a concentration‐dependent manner in NSCLC cells, such as A549, H460, H1299, and H596 cells. Also, Dehydrocorydaline suppressed the migration of H1299 cells by wound healing assay and transwell migration assay …",Jihyun Lee and Eun Jung Sohn and Sang Wook Yoon and Chang Geun Kim and Sangil Lee and Joe Young Kim and Namin Baek and Sung‐Hoon Kim,10,198157520252242668,Phytotherapy Research,3,441-448,,Anti‐Metastatic Effect of Dehydrocorydaline on H1299 Non‐Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Cells via Inhibition of Matrix Metalloproteinases and B Cell Lymphoma 2,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ptr.5766,31,2017
1944,"Poly(dibenzylated benzimidazolium) bromides (Bz-PBI-Br) were converted successfully to OH− ion conducting poly(dibenzylated benzimidazolium) hydroxides (Bz-PBI-hydroxides) by the treatment of KOH. The Bz-PBI-hydroxides obtained in this study showed an excellent alkali tolerance compared to previously synthesized poly(dimethylated benzimidazolium) hydroxides (Me-PBI-hydroxides). According to 1H-NMR analysis, Me-PBI-hydroxides were decomposed during KOH treatment. In order to find out the reason, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of two benzimidazolium structures, e.g., dimethylated benzimidazolium (Me-BI+) and dibenzylated benzimidazolium (Bz-BI+), were performed. Bz-BI+ showed lower electron affinity and OH−-binding energies at the C2 position of the benzimidazolium ring than Me-BI+. These DFT results strongly confirm that Bz-BI+ is less vulnerable to an OH− attack than Me …",Ju Yeon Lee and Dong-Hee Lim and Ji Eon Chae and Jieun Choi and Bo Hyun Kim and So Young Lee and Chang Won Yoon and Sang Yong Nam and Jong Hyun Jang and Dirk Henkensmeier and Sung Jong Yoo and Jin-Young Kim and Hyoung-Juhn Kim and Hyung Chul Ham,10,13925781079888656341,Journal of Membrane Science,,398-406,Elsevier,Base tolerant polybenzimidazolium hydroxide membranes for solid alkaline-exchange membrane fuel cells,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376738816303301,514,2016

1946,"Although imatinib mesylate (IM) in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) remains the best example of successful targeted therapy, majority of patients with CML suffer its toxicity profile and develop chemoresistance to existing therapeutic agents. Thus, there is a need to develop novel alternative therapies for the treatment of CML. Here, we investigated whether Korean red ginseng extract (KRGE) could suppress the proliferation and induce chemosensitization in human CML cells. Also, we used a human phospho‐antibody array containing 46 antibodies against signaling molecules to examine a subset of phosphorylation events after treatment. Korean red ginseng extract broadly suppressed the proliferation of five different cell lines, but KRGE was found to be the most potent inducer of apoptosis against KBM‐5 cells.

1950,"This paper proposes a simple energy-based controller for a class of underactuated mechanical systems. The mechanical systems considered in this study are modeled with two degrees of freedom, driven by only one actuator, and easily excited to oscillate. The proposed controller is designed by exploiting the passivity of the system. The energy storage function is constructed such that the control input is passive, with a combined output of actuated and unactuated variables. The target position of the closed-loop system is proven to be asymptotically stable using Lyapunov techniques and LaSalle’s invariance theorem. The proposed control law has a simple structure and is independent of system parameters. Numerical simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control method over a number of traditional controllers as well as its robustness against parameter …",Nguyen Quang Hoang and Soon-Geul Lee and Jae-Jun Kim and Byung Soo Kim,10,9534820517178122881,International journal of precision engineering and manufacturing,8,1529-1536,Korean Society for Precision Engineering,Simple energy-based controller for a class of underactuated mechanical systems,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12541-014-0501-z.pdf,15,2014
1951,"As in all other oviparous animals, lipoprotein receptors play a critical role in lipid metabolism and reproduction in decapod crustaceans. Four full-length cDNAs encoding lipoprotein receptors (Paj-VgR, Paj-LpR1, Paj-LpR2A, and Paj-LpR2B) were identified from Pandalopsis japonica through a combination of EST screening and PCR-based cloning. Paj-LpR1 appears to be the first crustacean ortholog of insect lipophorin receptors, and its two paralogs, Paj-LpR2A and Paj-LpR2B, exhibited similar structural characteristics. Several transcriptional isoforms were also identified for all three Paj-LpRs. Each expression pattern was unique, suggesting different physiological roles for these proteins. Paj-VgR is an ortholog of vitellogenin (Vg) receptors from other decapod crustaceans. A phylogenetic analysis of lipoproteins and their receptors suggested that the nomenclature of Vgs from decapod crustaceans may need to …",Ji-Hyun Lee and Bo Kwang Kim and Young-il Seo and Jung Hwa Choi and Seung-Wan Kang and Chang-Keun Kang and Won-gyu Park and Hyun-Woo Kim,10,16286818679769227097,Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part B: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,,51-62,Pergamon,Four cDNAs encoding lipoprotein receptors from shrimp (Pandalopsis japonica): Structural characterization and expression analysis during maturation,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096495913002121,169,2014

1953,"This paper investigates the controllable magnetorheological (MR) mount for the marine diesel-generator (D/G) sets. Sometimes, significant vibrations over the allowable limit are observed on the D/G sets due to their huge excitation forces. Because the severe vibration can lead to structural damages to the D/G sets, it should be reduced to below the limit. Although passive mounts with rubber isolators are usually used, the vibration reduction performance is not always sufficient. In addition, expecting that the vibration levels required by customers will get more severe, semi-active vibration isolation system needs to be developed. To the aim, the valve (flow) mode type of MR mount has been designed. Especially, the annular-radial configuration was adopted to enhance the damping force within the restricted space.

1954,"Our group previously reported that essential oil of Pinus koraiensis (EOPK) exerts antihyperlipidemic effects via upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor and inhibition of acyl-coenzyme A. In the present study, we investigated the antiobesity and hypolipidemic mechanism of EOPK using in vitro 3T3-L1 cells and in vivo HFD-fed rats. EOPK markedly suppressed fat accumulation and intracellular triglyceride associated with downregulation of adipogenic transcription factor expression, including PPARγ and CEBPα in the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Additionally, EOPK attenuated the expression levels of FABP and GPDH as target genes of PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 enhanced the decreased expression of FABP and PPARγ and fat accumulation induced by EOPK. To confirm the in vitro activity of EOPK, animal study was performed by administering normal diet, HFD, and/or EOPK at the dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg for 6 weeks. Consistently, EOPK significantly suppressed body weight gain, serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and AI value and increased HDL cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemistry revealed that EOPK treatment abrogated the expression of PPARγ in the liver tissue sections of EOPK-treated rats. Taken together, our findings suggest that EOPK has the antiobesic and hypolipidemic potential via inhibition of PPARγ-related signaling.",Hyun-Suk Ko and Hyo-Jeong Lee and Hyo-Jung Lee and Eun Jung Sohn and Miyong Yun and Min-Ho Lee and Sung-Hoon Kim,10,5612459844147180071,Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine,,,Hindawi,Essential oil of Pinus koraiensis exerts antiobesic and hypolipidemic activity via inhibition of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma signaling,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/947037/abs/,2013,2013

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces many genes encoding inflammatory mediators, including cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor‐α, interleukin‐1β, (IL‐1β), and IL‐6, chemokines, and prostaglandins in microglial cells. Quantitative proteomics methods with isobaric chemical labeling using tandem mass tags and 2D‐nano LC‐ESI‐MS/MS were used to systematically analyze proteomic changes in microglia responding to LPS stimulation. As a result, we found that the expression level of 21 proteins in human microglial cells changed after activation.
