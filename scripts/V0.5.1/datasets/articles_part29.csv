29007,"Species spatial distributions are the result of population demography, behavioral traits, and species interactions in spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site‐by‐species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis.

29009,"The shape of species’ responses along ecological gradients has important implications for both continuum theory and community analysis. Most current theories and analytical models in community ecology assume that responses are unimodal and symmetric. However, interactions between species and extreme environmental stress may cause skewed or non-unimodal responses. To date, statistical tools for evaluating response shapes have been either inappropriate, inefficient or biased. Using a data set on vascular plant distributions along an elevation gradient, we show that Huisman–Olff–Fresco (HOF) models are an effective method for this purpose, allowing models of various forms (skewed, symmetric, plateau, monotonic) to be tested for adequacy.

29010," Correspondence analysis (CA) and its Detrended form (DCA) produced by the program CANOCO are unstable under reordering of the species and sites in the input data matrix. In CA, the main cause of the instability is the use of insufficiently stringent convergence criteria in the power algorithm used to estimate the eigenvalues. The use of stricter criteria gives results that are acceptably stable. The divisive classification program TWINSPAN uses CA based on a similar algorithm, but with extremely lax convergence criteria, and is thus susceptible to extreme instability. We detected an order‐dependent programming error in the non‐linear rescaling procedure that forms part of DCA. When this bug is corrected, much of the instability in DCA disappears. The stability of DCA solutions is further enhanced by the use of strict convergence criteria.

Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid.

Fewer plants are found in plots of fixed size both if plants increase in size (and biomass therefore increases), or if vegetation becomes sparse (biomass decreases). The supposed response of species richness to biomass is therefore produced as an artefact of varying plant number. Grime derived a humped relationship between species richness and biomass from studies using relatively small quadrats of 50 cm x 50 cm, or 1/4 m2 (Al-Mufti et al. 1977; Grime 1979), and similar patterns have been found in many later studies on terrestrial vegetation (eg Moore & Keddy 1989; Wisheu & Keddy 1989; Wheeler & Shaw 1991; Garcia et al. 1993; Rosenzweig & Abramsky 1993; Abrams 1995).

In insects with changing voltinism (i.e. number of generations per season), sharp decreases in development time and body size are expected at season lengths where new generations are added to the phenology of a species, giving rise to saw‐tooth clines in these traits across latitudes. Growth rate variation may affect the magnitude of variation in body size or even reverse the saw‐tooth cline.2. In this study, we analyse latitudinal body size clines in four geometrid moths with changing voltinism in a common laboratory environment.

29054,"Four relatively homogeneous field data sets were analyzed, representing boreal, heath-like forest-floor and rock vegetation in Finland, corresponding to Finnish Calluna and Cladina site types. The methods used were principal component analysis (PCA) of covariance matrices, orthogonal correspondence analysis or reciprocal averaging (RA), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and linear and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS). RA and DCA gave ordinations in which every species had nearly equal weight. MDS and PCA gave results determined mostly by a few dominant species. MDS and PCA ordinations were very similar to RA and DCA ones when the original data were standardized so that for each species the mean of positive occurrences was the same while quantitative differences within species were retained.

29055," Methods for coupling two data sets (species composition and environmental variables for example) are well known and often used in ecology. All these methods require that variables of the two data sets have been recorded at the same sample stations. But if the two data sets arise from different sample schemes, sample locations can be different. In this case, scientists usually transform one data set to conform with the other one that is chosen as a reference. This inevitably leads to some loss of information. We propose a new ordination method, named spatial‐RLQ analysis, for coupling two data sets with different spatial sample techniques. Spatial‐RLQ analysis is an extension of co‐inertia analysis and is based on neighbourhood graph theory and classical RLQ analysis. This analysis finds linear combinations of variables of the two data sets which maximize the spatial cross‐covariance.

We hypothesized CH4 emissions to be higher from the sedge-dominated fens than from the older bog stage.

The descriptors of diversity are rather independent of lichen volume in southern forests.

We tested this by exploring mating frequencies of Pieris napi females along a latitudinal gradient in different generations. Pieris napi is a bivoltine butterfly, and genetically polyandrous females enjoy higher lifetime fecundity than monandrous ones. Polyandry is, however, coupled with a relatively low early fecundity.

The expected value and confidence intervals of neighbour diversity assuming random contacts can be found using bootstrapping. In general, frequent species have higher expected neighbour diversities with narrow confidence intervals than infrequent species. In fixed sand dunes dominated by lichens and bryophytes most species have lower than expected neighbour diversity. However, the fixed sand dunes seem to be a mixture of two patch types, with the species in lichen‐rich patches having higher diversities than the species in bryophyte‐rich patches.

29123,"Natural populations of herbivorous insects fluctuate widely, reaching outbreak levels only occasionally. This makes it difficult to interpret field observations of altered insect densities on woody plants in industrial environments. However, frequent outbreaks of needle-mining Lepidopterans in the vicinity of strongly polluting factories have been known since the 19th century. Aphids are another group of herbivorous insects that has been often reported to show positive numerical response in the vicinity of industrial pollution sources or close to motorways. The present paper summarizes studies where the population density of insects living on conifers around a pulp mill emitting mainly sulphur were determined. The results indicated that especially aphids living on the stems of young conifers and the larvae of needle-mining moths on older trees respond positively at population level to air pollution stress of the host plant. In the nearest vicinity of the pollution source where the host plants were severely damaged, the needle-miners did not show any increase in population density compared to background levels. A similar response to pollution levels around factory complexes has been shown with the pine bark bug in earlier studies. The response is probably due to disturbances in host plant physiology under air pollution stress resulting in a better quality of food for herbivorous insects. This suggests that increased densities of needle miners, the pine bark bug and some aphid species could be indicators of physiological disturbances in conifers in areas where symptoms of pollution damage are not visible. On the other hand, slight pollution stress combined …",Jarmo K Holopainen and Jari Oksanen,9,12716892280153144682,"M. Munawar, O., Hänninen, S. Roy, N. Munawar, L. Kärenlampi, D.

In field studies of cultivated and natural stands it was observed that the pollinators (bumble bees and honey bees) foraged optimally, ie, flight was towards the nearest flower. Therefore, in cultivation the plants should be planted so that the nearest neighbours belong to different clones.

29140,"Epiphytic lichens growing on the stems and branches of trees use trees only as their substrate. They are not parasitic and they do not harm the host trees. Instead, they get their nutrients from rain water and deposited dust. Epiphytic lichens are very effective in absorbing nutrients, and this is necessary for their survival and growth. Along with essential nutrients, lichens absorb many non-essential or harmful substances as well.Lichens are the result of symbiosis between algae and fungi. The thallus of a lichen is actually a minute ecosystem in which the primary producer, an alga, and a first-degree consumer, a lichen-forming fungus, live in close interaction. The alga is able to produce carbohydrates by photosynthesis. The fungus depends on the alga for its supply of carbohydrates. The symbiotic balance between the alga and the fungus is fragile and unfavourable conditions can break it down. The more sensitive partner thus determines the fate of the lichen. Conditions favourable for one of the two can also lead to the breakdown of the symbiosis and the death of the lichen. An improvement in the supply of nutrients, for instance, may enhance the growth of the alga but be harmful to the fungal partner.",Jari Oksanen and Toini Holopainen and Tupuna Kovanen and Mikko Kuusinen and Kari Mikkola and Rauni Ohtonen and Jarmo Poikolainen and Aulis Ritari and Marja-Liisa Sutinen and Sari Tarhanen and Henry Väre,3,15932195320629636116,Kola Peninsula pollutants and forest ecosystems in Lapland,,39-44,Ministry of Agriculture,Lichens are most sensitive,http://www.metla.fi/julkaisut/muut/elproj/chapt5.html,,1995,/scholar?cites=15932195320629636116,2WBRFVIAAAAJ:RYcK_YlVTxYC
29141,"During succession, plant species composition undergoes changes that may have implications for ecosystem functions. Here we aimed to study changes in plant species diversity, functional diversity and functional traits associated with mire development. We sampled vegetation from 22 mires on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Bothnia (west coast of Finland) that together represent seven different time steps along a mire chronosequence resulting from post-glacial rebound. This chronosequence spans a time period of almost 2500 years. Information about 15 traits of vascular plants and 17 traits of mosses was collected, mainly from two different databases. In addition to species richness and Shannon diversity index, we measured functional diversity and community weighted means of functional traits. We found that plant species diversity increased from the early succession stages towards the fen-bog transition. The latter stage also has the most diverse surface structure, consisting of pools and hummocks. Functional diversity increased linearly with species richness, suggesting a lack of functional redundancy during mire succession. On the other hand, Rao's quadratic entropy, another index of functional diversity, remained rather constant throughout the succession. The changes in functional traits indicate a trade-off between acquisitive and conservative strategies. The functional redundancy, i.e. the lack of overlap between similarly functioning species, may indicate that the resistance to environmental disturbances such as drainage or climate change does not change during mire succession. However, the trait trade-off towards conservative strategy …",AM Laine and Tuija Selänpää and J Oksanen and M Sevakivi and ES Tuittila,2,9330252374242972307,Mires and Peat,,,,Plant diversity and functional trait composition during mire development,https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/236972,,2018,/scholar?cites=9330252374242972307,2WBRFVIAAAAJ:uc_IGeMz5qoC

29144,"We studied 45 mid-boreal wetlands in a rugged land uplift coast with a thin cover of till. Wetlands ranged from 1 to 53 m asl and were of highly various sizes. Our aims were to examine, if vegetation types are valid in comparing wetlands, what kind of ecological major pattern the vegetation type composition of wetlands shows and how vegetation types distribute across altitudes. On those ground we discuss the wetland succession of the study area. We used the Finnish mire site types as vegetation types. Mire site types could be used for an ecological classification and ordination of the wetlands. As was expected, the major gradient consisted of the transition from mire margin (swamp) to expanse. The distribution of the Major Vegetational Wetland Groups (MVWG) responded to a general water-flow pattern in the landscape. Partly different peatland succession sequences occur in areas with small mire basins and in areas with larger mire basins with evolving mire complexes. Sequences of small wetlands and those of mire complexes follow the same trajectory only as far as the major gradient is considered while they differ with regard to the vegetation type composition of locally rare vegetation types and with regard to peatland morphology.

29154,"Following research that demonstrated its robustness and superior performance to alternative methods, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) has become widely used by ecologists for ordination of community data. Apart from the selection of dissimilarity measure, NMDS involves several option choices, some of which may be crucial to its success in effectively summarizing the major dimensions of community variation. The software commonly used by ecologists to perform NMDS does not allow control over certain options and this may account for dissatisfaction with the method expressed by some authors. NMDS derives an ordination in a specified number of dimensions in which inter-point distances are, as far as possible, in rank-order agreement with dissimilarities among sampling units (SUs). Agreement is quantified by stress, a normalized measure of the badness-of-fit of a monotonic regression of distances on dissimilarities. There are two ways of treating tied dissimilarities in monotonic regression: the primary (weak) approach allows pairs of SUs with equal dissimilarities to have unequal distances with no penalty to stress, while the secondary (strong) approach penalizes stress unless such pairs have equal distances.

29161,"To study the relationship between mire vegetation and ecological variables we tested the Finnish hypothesis that the mire margin to expanse gradient in vegetation composition relates to a gradient of solutes (main plant nutrients) in the soil that is separate from the mainly pH related poor–rich gradient. Successional mire basins where mire margin to expanse is the prominent gradient were surveyed. An indirect method (Ellenberg indicator values) and direct measurements (phosphorous concentrations, pH) were used to assess the relationship between the mire margin to expanse and nutrients gradients. Vegetation with indicators of Subtype A mire margin vegetation (assumed to reflect surface water flow) correlated best with Ellenberg nitrogen values, whereas Subtype B (assumed to reflect groundwater influence) correlated best with Ellenberg reaction values. Subtype C (supposed to reflect mineral soil influence) did not correlate with these Ellenberg values. The study provides information about the complexity of the vegetational gradients. In general, water flow seems to be related to the poor–rich gradient, but surface water flow is also related to the nutrients gradient. Subtype C (influence of mineral soil) seems to differ from the other two subtypes of the mire margin to expanse gradient and also from the poor–rich gradient.

29166,"Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was developed to correct perceived inadequacies of correspondence analysis in the ordination of community data. Nonlinear rescaling, incorporated into DCA to correct the compression of sampling unit scores towards the axis extremes, adjusts the scaling of species scores within axis segments in an effort to equalize the dispersions of species scores within sampling units. It has been claimed that rescaling produces axes along which the mean Gaussian tolerances of species’ responses is 1.0, so that the length of the rescaled axis is a measure of beta diversity. Though it has been shown to lack robustness as an ordination method, DCA and its constrained form, detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA), are now routinely used to assess the beta diversity of community data. The detailed algorithm for nonlinear rescaling has not been published so we examined the DECORANA source code and implemented the procedure in our own software. We then used both simulated community data, in which species had specified Gaussian responses to gradients, and field data for which the major driving gradients are understood to investigate the behavior of nonlinear rescaling and its success in producing axis lengths that matched the beta diversity of the data.",Jari Oksanen and Peter R Minchin,0,,The 94th ESA Annual Meeting,,,,COS 113-1: Does nonlinear rescaling of axes in detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) produce ecologically meaningful …,https://eco.confex.com/eco/2009/techprogram/P19675.HTM,,2009,,2WBRFVIAAAAJ:pqnbT2bcN3wC
29167,"Peatland research community generally considers ombrotrophic mires, or bogs, as climax ecosystems that have developed via autogenic processes. While the term climax ecosystem has been widely criticized, it quite well describes bogs, which can persist for thousands of years. In addition to persistence, the bog vegetation and hummock-hollow surface structure related to water table is surprisingly similar in different parts of the world. In this study our objective is to quantify the importance of autogenic development and allogenic forcing of climate for bog vegetation. We study the vegetation of seven European bogs along a climatic gradient from highly maritime Ireland to continental Russia. We compare the variation in vegetation within each bog explained by the water table gradient and the residual variation between the bogs. In each site we surveyed the vegetation along microtopographical transect from highest hummocks to hollows, in a manner that the internal variation was caught. We measured the water table level from each sample plot.

29168,"Compositional similarity between two communities often decreases as the geographical distance between them increases. Explanations for this pattern have typically relied on niche theory, emphasizing environmental control of species distributions, or neutral theory, invoking limited dispersal and speciation processes. We examined the relationship between community similarity, environmental similarity and geographic distance (1-1000 km) in three stream taxa (bryophytes, insects, diatoms), using partial Mantel test. As these groups exhibit very different dispersal abilities (highest for diatoms, lowest for invertebrates), we expected this to be reflected in the relative importance of environmental vs. spatial control of their community composition. Community similarity was strongly related to environmental similarity in all three groups, particularly diatoms (Mantel r: diatoms 0.53, bryophytes 0.38, invertebrates 0.33), whereas relationships with geographic distance were much weaker (0.13, 0.03 and 0.10, respectively). Thus, diatoms do not seem to deviate strongly from the other two groups, although they do exhibit the highest degree of environmental control. Similarly, the fact that bryophyte communities exhibited no relation to spatial distance partly supports the classical view for unicellular organisms:“everything is everywhere, environment selects”. Overall, our results provide more support for the niche-based explanations of community control.",Anna Astorga and Miska Luoto and Jari Oksanen and Janne Soininen and Risto Virtanen and Timo T Muotka,0,,,,,,Distance decay of similarity in stream communities: Is everything everywhere?,https://nabs.confex.com/nabs/2009/techprogram/P4358.HTM,,2009,,2WBRFVIAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC

29210,"Mitchell-Olds & Shaw test concerns the location of the highest (hump) or lowest (pit) value of a quadratic curve at given points. Typically, it is used to study whether the quadratic hump or pit is located within a studied interval. The current test is generalized so that it applies generalized linear models (glm) with link function instead of simple quadratic curve. The test was popularized in ecology for the analysis of humped species richness patterns (Mittelbach et al. 2001), but it is more general. With logarithmic link function, the quadratic response defines the Gaussian response model of ecological gradients (ter Braak & Looman 1986), and the test can be used for inspecting the location of Gaussian optimum within a given range of the gradient. It can also be used to replace Tokeshi's test of “bimodal” species frequency distribution.",Jari Oksanen,0,,,,,,Mitchell-Olds & Shaw Test for the Location of Quadratic Extreme,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1234410505711235188&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,2WBRFVIAAAAJ:M05iB0D1s5AC
