The data are exclusively from the chloroplast gene rbcL, which codes for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO or RuBPCase). We used two different state-transformation assumptions resulting in two sets of cladograms: (i) equal-weighting for the 499-taxon analysis; and (ii) a procedure that differentially weights transversions over transitions within characters and codon positions among characters for the 475-taxon analysis.

One form of protein electrophoresis, isozyme analysis, has become particularly prominent in systematic and evolutionary biology as well as agronomy (Tanksley and Orton, 1983). Isozymes, or multiple molecular forms of enzymes, are enzymes that share a common substrate but differ in electrophoretic mobility (Markert and Moller, 1959). They are revealed when tissue extracts are subjected to electrophoresis in various types of gels and subsequently submersed in solutions containing enzyme-specific stains.

28007,"Polyploidy has played a major role in the evolution of many eukaryotes. Recent studies have dramatically reshaped views of polyploid evolution, demonstrating that most polyploid species examined, both plant and animal, have formed recurrently from different populations of their progenitors. Populations of independent origin can subsequently come into contact and hybridize, generating new genotypes. Because of the frequency of polyploidy in plants, many recognized species are probably polyphyletic. Extensive and rapid genome restructuring can occur after polyploidization. Such changes can be mediated by transposons. Polyploidization could represent a period of transilience, during which genomic changes occur, potentially producing new gene complexes and facilitating rapid evolution.",Douglas E Soltis and Pamela S Soltis,1106,4281308590300913464,,9,348-352,Elsevier Current Trends,Polyploidy: recurrent formation and genome evolution,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534799016389,14,1999,/scholar?cites=4281308590300913464,tQynSj0AAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC

Fifty years later, many of the questions  Stebbins posed have not been answered, and many new questions have  arisen. In this paper, we review some of the genetic attributes of  polyploids that have been suggested to account for the tremendous  success of polyploid plants. Based on a limited number of studies, we  conclude: (i) Polyploids, both individuals and  populations, generally maintain higher levels of heterozygosity than do  their diploid progenitors.

Recent genomic investigations not only indicate that polyploidy is ubiquitous among angiosperms, but also suggest several ancient genome‐doubling events. These include ancient whole genome duplication (WGD) events in basal angiosperm lineages, as well as a proposed paleohexaploid event that may have occurred close to the eudicot divergence. However, there is currently no evidence for WGD in Amborella, the putative sister species to other extant angiosperms. The question is no longer “What proportion of angiosperms are polyploid?”, but “How many episodes of polyploidy characterize any given lineage?” New algorithms provide promise that ancestral genomes can be reconstructed for deep divergences (e.g., it may be possible to reconstruct the ancestral eudicot or even the ancestral angiosperm genome).

28010,"The importance of hybridization in plant speciation and evolution has been debated for decades, with opposing views of hybridization as either a creative evolutionary force or evolutionary noise. Hybrid speciation may occur at either the homoploid (i.e., between two species of the same ploidy) or the polyploid level, each with its attendant genetic and evolutionary consequences. Whereas allopolyploidy (i.e., resulting from hybridization and genome doubling) has long been recognized as an important mode of plant speciation, the implications of genome duplication have typically not been taken into account in most fields of plant biology.

28020,"Despite the potential power and extensive use of DNA variation for phylogenetic reconstruction, it has become increasingly apparent that DNA phylogenies are often discordant with organismal phylogenies. Factors responsible for discordance include sampling error, convergence, evolutionary rate heterogeneity, lineage sorting, and reticulation. Of these five factors, reticulation is perhaps the most likely to lead to faulty phylogenetic conclusions in plants due to their high potential for interspecific gene now. This problem is particularly acute for the clonally inherited cytoplasmic genomes (mitochondrial and chloroplast), where evidence of reticulation would be most easily missed. We found evidence for over 36 examples of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) capture through hybridization/introgression, many of which were unexpected. In many instances, cytoplasmic exchange appears to have occurred in the absence of significant nuclear gene now and sometimes the native cytoplasm has been completely displaced by an alien one. Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that differential cytoplasmic exchange can occur by a variety of processes and with remarkable speed. Unfortunately, it is difficult to demarcate a taxonomic zone of safety because unexpected events of chloroplast capture can occur at a variety of taxonomic levels: among closely related, species, at the sectional level within a genus, and at the generic level.

Not only are they a model group for studying the patterns and processes of evolutionary diversification, they also play major roles in our economy, diet, and courtship rituals, producing our fruits, legumes, and grains, not to mention the flowers in our Valentine’s bouquets. They are also crucial ecologically, dominating most terrestrial and some aquatic landscapes. This fully revised edition of Phylogeny and Evolution of the Angiosperms provides an up-to-date, comprehensive overview of the evolution of and relationships among these vital plants. Incorporating molecular phylogenetics with morphological, chemical, developmental, and paleobotanical data, as well as presenting a more detailed account of early angiosperm fossils and important fossil information for each evolutionary branch of the angiosperms, the new edition integrates fossil evidence into a robust phylogenetic framework.

Genetic diploidization begins with the earliest responses to genome merger and doubling; less is known about chromosomal diploidization. Polyploidy duplicates every gene in the genome, providing the raw material for divergence or partitioning of function in homoeologous copies.

28055,"Phylogeography is concerned with the principles and processes that determine the geographic distributions of genealogical lineages, within and among closely related species (Avise et al. 1987; Avise 2000). Although this field of study is very new (only a little more than a decade has passed since the term ‘phylogeography’was first coined; see Avise et al. 1987), the scientific literature in this research area is now voluminous. To date, most phylogeographic investigations of natural populations have focused on muticellular animals (Hewitt 1993; Patton et al. 1994; daSilva & Patton 1998; Eizirik et al. 1998; Avise 2000; Hewitt 2000; Schaal & Olsen 2000; Sullivan et al. 2000). This bias is due in large part to the ready availability of population-level genetic markers afforded by the animal mitochondrial genome. The more slowly evolving chloroplast genome, in contrast, often does not provide sufficient variation to reconstruct phylogeny at the populational level (Soltis et al. 1997; Schaal et al. 1998; Schaal & Olsen 2000). Phylogeographic data have accumulated so rapidly for animal taxa that it has been possible to compare phylogeographic structure among codistributed species.

28075,"Contributions from paleobotany, phylogenetics, genomics, developmental biology, and developmental genetics have yielded tremendous insight into Darwin’s “abominable mystery”—the origin and rapid diversification of the angiosperms. Analyses of morphological and molecular data reveal a revised “anthophyte clade” consisting of the fossils glossopterids, Pentoxylon, Bennettitales, and Caytonia as sister to angiosperms. Molecular estimates of the age of crown group angiosperms have converged on 140–180 million years ago (Ma), older than the oldest fossils (132 Ma), suggesting that older fossils remain to be discovered. Whether the first angiosperms were forest shrubs (darkand-disturbed hypothesis) or aquatic herbs (wet-and-wild hypothesis) remains unclear. The near-basal phylogenetic position of Nymphaeales (water lilies), which may include the well-known fossil Archaefructus, certainly indicates that the aquatic habit arose early. After initial, early “experiments,” angiosperms radiated rapidly (≤ 5 million years [Myr]), yielding the five lineages of Mesangiospermae (magnoliids and Chloranthaceae as sisters to a clade of monocots and eudicots+ Ceratophyllaceae).

We recovered highly concordant relationships using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP), with 98.2% mean ML bootstrap support across monocots. For the first time, ML resolves ties among Poales and other commelinid orders with moderate to strong support.

However, due to a conservative rate of evolution, 18S rDNA alone sometimes provides too few phylogenetically informative characters to resolve relationships adequately. Previous studies using partial sequences have suggested the potential of 26S or large-subunit (LSU) rDNA for phylogeny retrieval at taxonomic levels comparable to those investigated with 18S rDNA. Here we explore the patterns of molecular evolution of entire 26S rDNA sequences and their impact on phylogeny retrieval.

28085," The age of the angiosperms has long been of interest to botanists and evolutionary biologists. Many early efforts to date the age of the angiosperms and evolutionary divergences within the angiosperm clade using a molecular clock have yielded age estimates that are grossly inconsistent with the fossil record. We investigated the age of angiosperms using Bayesian relaxed clock (BRC) and penalized likelihood (PL) approaches. Both of these methods allow the incorporation of multiple fossil constraints into the optimization procedure. The BRC method allows a range of values for among‐lineage rate of substitution, from a nearly clocklike behavior to a condition in which each branch is allowed an optimal substitution rate, and also accounts for variation in molecular evolution across multiple genes.

Tissue types (e.g., leaf vs. flower) varied in RNA quality, sequencing depth and the number of scaffolds. Tissue age also influenced RNA quality but not the number of scaffolds ≥1000 bp. Overall, 36% of the variation in the number of scaffolds was explained by metrics of RNA integrity (RIN score), RNA purity (OD 260/230), sequencing platform (GAIIx vs HiSeq) and the amount of total RNA used for sequencing. However, our results show that the most commonly used measures of RNA quality (e.g., RIN) are weak predictors of the number of scaffolds because Illumina sequencing is robust to variation in RNA quality.

Numerous hypotheses have been suggested to explain the phylogenetically restricted occurrence of betalains and their apparent mutual exclusion with anthocyanins. In this review, we evaluate these hypotheses in the face of a changing interpretation of Caryophyllales phylogeny and new comparative genetic data.

28105,"Background Polyploidy, frequently termed “whole genome duplication”, is a major force in the evolution of many eukaryotes. Indeed, most angiosperm species have undergone at least one round of polyploidy in their evolutionary history. Despite enormous progress in our understanding of many aspects of polyploidy, we essentially have no information about the role of chromosome divergence in the establishment of young polyploid populations. Here we investigate synthetic lines and natural populations of two recently and recurrently formed allotetraploids Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus (formed within the past 80 years) to assess the role of aberrant meiosis in generating chromosomal/genomic diversity. That diversity is likely important in the formation, establishment and survival of polyploid populations and species.  Methodology/Principal Findings Applications of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to natural populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus suggest that chromosomal rearrangements and other chromosomal changes are common in both allotetraploids. We detected extensive chromosomal polymorphism between individuals and populations, including (i) plants monosomic and trisomic for particular chromosomes (perhaps indicating compensatory trisomy), (ii) intergenomic translocations and (iii) variable sizes and expression patterns of individual ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci. We even observed karyotypic variation among sibling plants. Significantly, translocations, chromosome loss, and meiotic irregularities, including quadrivalent formation, were observed in synthetic (S0 and S1 generations) polyploid lines.

28108,"Polyploidy, or whole-genome duplication (WGD), is a ubiquitous feature of plant genomes, contributing to variation in both genome size and gene content. Although polyploidy has occurred in all major clades of land plants, it is most frequent in angiosperms. Following a WGD in the common ancestor of all extant angiosperms, a complex pattern of both ancient and recent polyploidy is evident across angiosperm phylogeny. In several cases, ancient WGDs are associated with increased rates of species diversification. For example, a WGD in the common ancestor of Asteraceae, the largest family of angiosperms with ∼25 000 species, is statistically linked to a shift in species diversification; several other old WGDs are followed by increased diversification after a ‘lag’ of up to three nodes.

Here we analyze temporal and spatial divergence patterns of cloud forest plant and animal species and relate them to the evolutionary history of naturally fragmented cloud forests–among the most threatened vegetation types in northern Mesoamerica. We used comparative phylogeographic analyses to identify patterns of co-vicariance in taxa that share geographic ranges across cloud forest habitats and to elucidate the influence of historical events on current patterns of biodiversity. We document temporal and spatial genetic divergence of 15 species (including seed plants, birds and rodents), and relate them to the evolutionary history of the naturally fragmented cloud forests. We used fossil-calibrated genealogies, coalescent-based divergence time inference, and estimates of gene flow to assess the permeability of putative barriers to gene flow. We also used the hierarchical Approximate Bayesian Computation (HABC) method implemented in the program msBayes to test simultaneous versus non-simultaneous divergence of the cloud forest lineages. Our results show shared phylogeographic breaks that correspond to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Los Tuxtlas, and the Chiapas Central Depression, with the Isthmus representing the most frequently shared break among taxa.

An excellent example is Saxifragaceae sensu lato, which represents one of the major phylogenetic problems in angiosperms at higher taxonomic levels.

Although more recent classifications fundamentally modified this scheme, little agreement exists regarding the circumscription, taxonomic rank, or relationships of these subfamilies.

Examination of vegetative shoot development revealed that Amborella possesses both decussate and alternate phyllotaxy; one may simply be a special case of the other as a reaction to meristem size and shape. The transition from bracts to tepals is gradual, making it difficult to determine exactly where a flower begins in this species. Although flowers of Amborella are described as having spiral phyllotaxy, the periphery of the flower could be considered unidirectionally whorled. This new observation, together with observations of both spiral and whorled phyllotaxy in other basal angiosperms (e.g., Nuphar, Drimys, Ceratophyllum), further demonstrates the flexibility of floral development in basal angiosperms; i.e., some basal angiosperms are not fully committed to either spiral or whorled …",Matyas Buzgo and Pamela S Soltis and Douglas E Soltis,127,16322390765112871577,International Journal of Plant Sciences,6,925-947,The University of Chicago Press,Floral Developmental Morphology of Amborella trichopoda (Amborellaceae),https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/424024,165,2004,/scholar?cites=16322390765112871577,tQynSj0AAAAJ:eJXPG6dFmWUC

Their ability to thrive under low-light conditions has been linked to the evolution of a novel chimeric photoreceptor—neochrome—that fuses red-sensing phytochrome and blue-sensing phototropin modules into a single gene, thereby optimizing phototropic responses. Despite being implicated in facilitating the diversification of modern ferns, the origin of neochrome has remained a mystery. We present evidence for neochrome in hornworts (a bryophyte lineage) and demonstrate that ferns acquired neochrome from hornworts via horizontal gene transfer (HGT).

Whereas early estimates largely based on chromosome counts suggested that perhaps 30–50% of all angiosperms may be polyploids, modern genome studies prompted the stunning realization that all or nearly all angiosperms likely have polyploidy in their evolutionary history (eg, ref. 6).

The paucity of electrophoretic studies of ferns and fern allies may be due in large part to the high concentrations of condensed tannins that many species contain (Cooper-Driver, 1976 and pers. comm.). These compounds render enzymes inactive by binding with them following cellular disruption, thereby frustrating researchers who have attempted electrophoretic analysis utilizing standard methods of sample preparation.The method of sample preparation developed by Kelley and Adams (1977a, b) in their analysis of enzyme variation in Juniperus was an important procedural breakthrough in overcoming the difficulties that result from the liberation of large amounts of phenolic compounds during tissue preparation. Recently, a simplified version of that method was applied by Soltis et al.(1980) to fern leaf tissue, facilitating rapid preparation of active enzyme samples and thereby making electrophoretic analyses of large numbers of individuals more feasible.

Our results reveal that most genera, including Tragopogon, Epilasia, Podospermum, Koelpinia, and Lasiospora, are monophyletic. The monotypic Pterachaenia and Tourneuxia are distinct lineages within Scorzonerinae. The monotypic Geropogon, which has often been included in Tragopogon, is phylogenetically removed from the highly supported Tragopogon clade.

ABC transporters act to transport compounds across cellular membranes and are involved in a diverse range of biological processes. Thus, the applicability to biotechnology is vast, including cancer resistance in humans, drug resistance among vertebrates, and herbicide and other xenobiotic resistance in plants. In addition, plants appear to harbor the highest diversity of ABC transporter genes compared with any other group of organisms. This study applied transcriptome analysis to survey the kingdom-wide ABC transporter diversity in plants and suggest biotechnology applications of this diversity. We utilized sequence similarity-based informatics techniques to infer the identity of ABC transporter gene candidates from 1295 phylogenetically-diverse plant transcriptomes. A total of 97,149 putative (approximately 25 % were full-length) ABC transporter gene members were identified; each RNA-Seq library (plant sample) had 88 ± 30 gene members. As expected, simpler organisms, such as algae, had fewer unique members than vascular land plants. Differences were also noted in the richness of certain ABC transporter subfamilies.

28351,"The flower itself, which comprises most of the evolutionary innovations of flowering plants, bears special significance for understanding the origin and diversification of angiosperms. The sudden origin of angiosperms in the fossil record poses unanswered questions on both the origins of flowering plants and their rapid spread and diversification. Central to these questions is the role that the flower, and floral diversity, played. Recent clarifications of angiosperm phylogeny provide the foundation for investigating evolutionary transitions in floral features and the underlying genetic mechanisms of stasis and change. The general features of floral diversity can best be addressed by considering key patterns of variation: an undifferentiated versus a differentiated perianth; elaboration of perianth organs in size and color; merosity of the flower; and phyllotaxy of floral organs.

28395,"The Humifusa clade represents a recent radiation that originated in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene and consists of about 10 species widely distributed in North America from northern Mexico north to Ontario, Canada, and south to the Florida Keys. This clade likely originated in the edaphically subxeric regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, and from there it later spread to the southeastern United States and ultimately produced a small radiation in the eastern United States. Hybridization among evolutionarily divergent diploid species of the southeastern (SE) and southwestern (SW) United States subclades led to the origin of many polyploid taxa, which today occupy about 75% of the distribution of the clade. Here we present a taxonomic revision of the SE subclade of the Humifusa clade and polyploid derivatives that commonly occur in the eastern United States (ie, the O. humifusa complex). We recognize eight taxa: Opuntia abjecta, O. austrina, O. cespitosa, O. drummondii, O. humifusa, O. mesacantha subsp. mesacantha, O. mesacantha subsp. lata, and O. nemoralis, as well as the interclade allopolyploid, Opuntia ochrocentra, derived, in part, from a member of the O. humifusa complex.

28413,"A salient feature of flowering plant diversification is the emergence of a novel suite of floral features coinciding with the origin of the most species-rich lineage, Pentapetalae. Advances in phylogenetics, developmental genetics and genomics, including new analyses presented here, are helping to reconstruct the specific evolutionary steps involved in the evolution of this clade. The enormous floral diversity among Pentapetalae appears to be built on a highly conserved ground plan of five-parted (pentamerous) flowers with whorled phyllotaxis. By contrast, lability in the number and arrangement of component parts of the flower characterize the early-diverging eudicot lineages subtending Pentapetalae. The diversification of Pentapetalae also coincides closely with ancient hexaploidy, referred to as the gamma whole-genome triplication, for which the phylogenetic timing, mechanistic details and molecular evolutionary …",Andre S Chanderbali and Brent A Berger and Dianella G Howarth and Douglas E Soltis and Pamela S Soltis,22,9212626690580232062,,1713,20150509,The Royal Society,"Evolution of floral diversity: genomics, genes and gamma",https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstb.2015.0509,372,2017,/scholar?cites=9212626690580232062,tQynSj0AAAAJ:WzTVkKNmPSkC

28442,"The “tree of life” has become a metaphor for the interconnectivity and breadth of all life on Earth. It also has come to symbolize the broad investigation of biodiversity, including both the reconstruction of phylogeny and the numerous downstream analyses that are possible with a firm phylogenetic underpinning. Only a few decades ago, the construction of large phylogenetic trees of hundreds of taxa (or more) was considered an impossible task due to the immense computational challenges posed by analyses of large data sets. And no wonder—the number of possible trees that can describe the relationships of just 200 species exceeds the number of atoms in the universe (Hillis, 1996). As a result, building the tree of all named life, including the green plant branch (Viridiplantae)—a major clade with perhaps 500,000 species—has long been considered a grand challenge in biology. However, a perfect storm of algorithm development, increases in computational power, and DNA sequencing improvements over the last decade has not only made the construction of large trees more feasible, but also allowed us to attain some far-reaching goals—a noteworthy example being the recent publication of a first draft tree of all life (Hinchcliff et al., 2015). In plant biology, the frequent reconstruction of large phylogenetic trees has had an immense impact on the field. Large trees have helped to resolve deep-level relationships and resulted in the revision of classifications, including some of the most profound changes in our view of plant relationships over the past 200 years (eg, reviewed in part by Gitzendanner et al., 2018, in this issue).

28443,"Allopolyploids, formed by hybridization and chromosome doubling, face the immediate challenge of having duplicated nuclear genomes that interact with the haploid and maternally inherited cytoplasmic (plastid and mitochondrial) genomes. Most of our knowledge of the genomic consequences of allopolyploidy has focused on the fate of the duplicated nuclear genes without regard to their potential interactions with cytoplasmic genomes. As a step toward understanding the fates of nuclear-encoded subunits that are plastid-targeted, here we examine the retention and expression of the gene encoding the small subunit of Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; rbcS) in multiple populations of allotetraploid Tragopogon miscellus (Asteraceae). These polyploids formed recently (~80 years ago) and repeatedly from T. dubius and T. pratensis in the northwestern United States. Examination of 79 T. miscellus individuals from 10 natural populations, as well as 25 synthetic allotetraploids, including reciprocally formed plants, revealed a low percentage of naturally occurring individuals that show a bias in either gene (homeolog) loss (12%) or expression (16%), usually toward maintaining the maternal nuclear copy of rbcS. For individuals showing loss, seven retained the maternally derived rbcS homeolog only, while three had the paternally derived copy. All of the synthetic polyploid individuals examined (S0 and S1 generations) retained and expressed both parental homeologs.

28456,"Corolla length is a labile flower feature and has strong implications for pollinator success. However, the phenotypic and genetic bases of corolla elongation are not well known, largely due to a lack of good candidate genes for potential genetic exploration and functional work. We investigate both the cellular phenotypic differences in corolla length, as well as the genetic control of this trait, in Saltugilia (Polemoniaceae). Taxa in this clade exhibit a large range of flower sizes and differ dramatically in pollinator guilds. Flowers of each species were collected from multiple individuals during four stages of flower development to ascertain if cell number or cell size is more important in determining flower size. In Saltugilia, flower size appears to be driven more by cell size than cell number. Fully mature flowers of all taxa contain jigsaw cells similar to cells seen in sepals and leaves; however, these cells are not typically found in most developing flowers. The proportion of this cell type in mature flowers appears to have substantial implications, comprising 17% to 68% of the overall flower size. To identify candidate genes responsible for differences in cell area and cell type, transcriptomes were generated for two individuals of the species with the smallest (S. australis) and largest (S. splendens subsp. grantii) flowers across the same four developmental stages visualized with confocal microscopy. Analyses identified genes associated with cell wall formation that are up-regulated in the mature flower stage compared to mid-stage flowers (75% of mature size).

Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, has been recognized as an important evolutionary mechanism of plant diversification. However, in non-model plants the molecular signals of genome duplications have remained largely unexplored. High-throughput transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing have set the stage for novel investigations of genome evolution using new bioinformatic and methodological tools in a phylogenetic framework. Here we compare ten de novo-assembled transcriptomes representing the major lineages of the angiosperm genus Cornus (dogwood) and relevant outgroups using a customized pipeline for analyses. Using three distinct approaches, molecular dating of orthologous genes, analyses of the distribution of synonymous substitutions between paralogous genes, and examination of substitution rates through time, we detected a shared WGD event in the late Cretaceous across all taxa sampled. The inferred doubling event coincides temporally with the paleoclimatic changes associated with the initial divergence of the genus into three major lineages. Analyses also showed an acceleration of rates of molecular evolution after WGD. The highest rates of molecular evolution were observed in the transcriptome of the herbaceous lineage, C. canadensis, a species commonly found at higher latitudes, including the Arctic.

There is, therefore, no evidence of polyploid gene expression for the enzymes analyzed. These results for Psilotophyta are similar to those obtained for other lineages of homosporous pteridophytes, i.e., Arthrophyta and homosporous Microphyllophyta and Pteridophyta, all of which should be considered genetically diploid.

Instead, most global studies have focussed on vertebrates, as these taxa have historically been associated with the most complete data. Here, we address this shortfall by first investigating global diversity gradients in monocots, a morphologically and functionally diverse clade representing a quarter of flowering plant diversity, and then assessing congruence between monocot and vertebrate diversity patterns. To do this, we create a new dataset that merges biome-level associations for all monocot genera with country-level associations for almost all ∼70,000 species. We then assess the evidence for direct versus indirect effects of this plant diversity on vertebrate diversity using a combination of linear regression and structural equation modelling (SEM). Finally, we also calculate overlap of diversity hotspots for monocots and each vertebrate taxon. Monocots follow a latitudinal gradient although with pockets of extra-tropical diversity, mirroring patterns in vertebrates. Monocot diversity is positively associated with vertebrate diversity, but the strength of correlation varies depending on the clades being compared. Monocot diversity explains marginal amounts of variance (<10%) after environmental factors have been accounted for.

28539,"We describe a mechanistic individual-based model of how global macroclimatic constraints affect the energy budgets of ectothermic animals. The model uses macroclimatic and biophysical characters of the habitat and organism and tenets of heat transfer theory to calculate hourly temperature availabilities over a year. Data on the temperature dependence of activity rate, metabolism, food consumption and food processing capacity are used to estimate the net rate of resource assimilation which is then integrated over time. We detail and explore the significance of assumptions used in these calculations. We present a new test of this model in which we show that the predicted energy budget sizes for 11 populations of the lizard Sceloporus undulatus are in close agreement with observed results from previous field studies. This demonstrates that model tests are feasible and the results are reasonable. Further, since the model represents an upper bound to the size of the energy budget, observed residual deviations form explicit predictions about the effects of environmental constraints on the bioenergetics of the study lizards within each site that may be tested by future field and laboratory studies. Three major new improvements to our modeling are discussed. We present a means to estimate microclimate thermal heterogeneity more realistically and include its effects on field rates of individual activity and food consumption.

28543,"The increased availability of large phylogenomic datasets is often accompanied by difficulties in disentangling and harnessing the data. These difficulties may be enhanced for species resulting from reticulate evolution and/or rapid radiations producing large-scale discordance. As a result, there is a need for methods to investigate discordance, and in turn, use this conflict to inform and aid in downstream analyses. Therefore, we drew upon multiple analytical tools to investigate the evolution of Micranthes (Saxifragaceae), a clade of primarily Arctic-alpine herbs impacted by reticulate and rapid radiations. To elucidate the evolution of Micranthes we sought near-complete taxon sampling with multiple accessions per species and assembled extensive nuclear (518 putatively single copy loci) and plastid (95 loci) datasets. In addition to a robust phylogeny for Micranthes, this research shows that genetic discordance presents a valuable opportunity to develop hypotheses about its underlying causes, such as hybridization, polyploidization, and range shifts. Specifically, we present a multi-step approach that incorporates multiple checks points for paralogy, including reciprocally blasting targeted genes against transcriptomes, running paralogy checks during the assembly step, and grouping genes into gene families to look for duplications.

Integrating multiple methods of transcript analysis, we document a difference in transcriptome size, and make multiple comparisons of transcript abundance in diploid and autotetraploid Tolmiea.We use RNA spike-in standards to identify and correct for differences in transcriptome size, and compare levels of gene expression across multiple scales: per transcriptome, per cell, and per biomass.In total, ~17% of all loci were identified as differentially expressed (DEGs) between the diploid and autopolyploid species. A shift in total transcriptome size resulted in only ~58% of the total DEGs being identified as differentially expressed following a per transcriptome normalization. When transcript abundance was normalized per cell, ~82% of the total DEGs were recovered. The discrepancy between per-transcriptome and per-cell recovery of DEGs occurs because per-transcriptome normalizations are concentration-based and therefore blind to differences in transcriptome size.While each normalization enables valid comparisons at biologically relevant scales, a holistic comparison of multiple normalizations provides additional explanatory power not available from any single approach.

Here, we review the current understanding of polyploidy at the organismal and suborganismal levels, identify shared research themes and elements, and propose new directions to integrate research on polyploidy toward confronting interdisciplinary grand challenges of the 21st century.",Donald T Fox and Douglas E Soltis and Pamela S Soltis and Tia-Lynn Ashman and Yves Van de Peer,4,10474392386757755201,,,,Elsevier Current Trends,Polyploidy: A Biological Force From Cells to Ecosystems,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962892420301240,,2020,/scholar?cites=10474392386757755201,tQynSj0AAAAJ:ON9TkA72AHEC

Classic compilations of chromosome numbers include those of Löve and Löve (1948); Darlington and Wylie (1955); Fedorov (1969). Excellent reviews are provided by Goldblatt and Lowry (2011); Cusimano et al.(2012) and most recently by Rice et al.(in press.). One of the more important traditional uses of chromosome numbers has been the investigation of polyploidy, including inferences of ancient polyploidy, with a rich tradition that includes the work of Stebbins (1950) and Grant (1981), reviewed in Soltis et al.(2014). These foundational studies set the stage for many of the comparative genomic analyses conducted in the past decade.Genomic insights are now common, but for decades basic cytological research was the major source of information that provided a view of the genome.

28596,"Should we build our own phylogenetic trees based on gene sequence data, or can we simply use available synthesis phylogenies? This is a fundamental question that any study involving a phylogenetic framework must face at the beginning of the project. Building a phylogeny from gene sequence data (purpose-built phylogeny) requires more effort and expertise than subsetting an already available phylogeny (synthesis-based phylogeny). If phylogenetic diversity estimates based on these two types of phylogenies are highly correlated, using readily available synthesis-based phylogenies is justified for comparing phylogenetic diversity among communities. However, a comparison of how these two approaches to building phylogenetic trees influence the calculation of phylogenetic diversity has not been explicitly tested. We generated threepurpose-built phylogenies and their corresponding synthesis-based trees (two from Phylomatic and one from the Open Tree of Life). We then used a simulation approach to generate 1000 communities with a fixed number of species per site and compared the effects of different trees on estimates of phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity using Spearman’s rank-based correlation and linear mixed models. Synthesis-based phylogenies generally over-estimated phylogenetic diversity when compared to purpose-built ones. However, their resulting measures of phylogenetic diversity were highly correlated (Spearman’s r > 0.8 in most cases).

In this study, we investigated plastome evolution across the family, reconstructed the phylogeny of the Heuchera group and examined putative plastid capture between Heuchera and Tiarella. Seven species (11 individuals) representing Tiarella, as well as Mitella and Heuchera, were selected for genome skimming. We assembled the plastomes, and then compared these to six others published for Saxifragaceae; the plastomes were found to be highly similar in overall size, structure, gene order and content. Moreover, ycf15 was lost due to pseudogenization and rpl2 lost its only intron for all the analyzed plastomes. Comparative plastome analysis revealed that size variations of the plastomes are purely ascribed to the length differences of LSC, SSC, and IRs regions. Using nuclear ITS+ETS and the complete plastome, we fully resolved the species relationships of Tiarella, finding that the genus is monophyletic and the Asian species is most closely related to the western North American species.

It is written by three British junior trainees in plastic surgery who have clearly recognised a need for such an essential book. Unfortunately, as plastic surgery is considered to be largely a postgraduate specialty, teaching of its fundamental principles are often neglected at an undergraduate level. This book is a most appropriate means of bridging the gap in knowledge and practical skills required by junior trainees in plastic surgery as well as undergraduate medical students. As a trainee plastic surgeon on-call, the majority of referrals of patients are the result of trauma and unsurprisingly this subject matter also ensures that this book is suitable for trainees in emergency medicine, orthopaedics and trauma and general practice.The book covers the most common clinical problems encountered by the trainee in plastic surgery.

However, as angiosperm‐dominated forest canopies emerged in the Cretaceous period there was an explosive diversification of modern (leptosporangiate) ferns, which thrived in low, blue‐enhanced light beneath angiosperm canopies. A mechanistic explanation for this transformative event in the diversification of ferns has remained elusive. We used physiological assays, transcriptome analysis and evolutionary bioinformatics to investigate a potential connection between the evolution of enhanced stomatal sensitivity to blue‐light in modern ferns and the rise of angiosperm‐dominated forests in the geologic record.

Most polyploid species examined have multiple origins, which provide genetic diversity and may enhance the success of polyploids.

Although great progress has been made in understanding the genetic consequences of polyploidy, the genetic implications of reciprocal polyploidization remain poorly understood, especially in natural polyploids.

We also undertook the first direct, quantitative comparisons of spatial phylogenetic patterns between butterflies and flowering plants in North America. We expected concordance between butterflies and angiosperms based on both shared historical environmental drivers and presumed strong butterfly-host plant specializations. We instead found that biodiversity patterns in butterflies are strikingly different from flowering plants in some regions of the continent. In particular, the warm desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico showed surprisingly high butterfly phylogenetic diversity and endemism, in contrast to much lower values for angiosperms. Butterflies did not show patterns of phylogenetic clustering as found in flowering plants, suggesting differences in habitat conservation between the two groups.

28643,"The value of the Tree of Life to human well-being and survival is enormous—our species simply cannot thrive without a biodiverse planet; that is, a healthy Tree of Life. The vast importance of the Tree of Life falls into several general categories. First, the immense overall importance of biodiversity not only involves providing food, medicines, and ecosystem services such as clean air and water, but also a second major theme of this chapter is the importance to human well-being of knowledge of how species are related. Knowledge of how organisms are related has predictive value. We all know from our own family trees that relationships matter. For example, if a close relative has a disease or cancer that is genetically inherited, we realize that there is a chance we may have inherited that trait.

Because incomplete sampling may bias our inferences, we must evaluate how future additions of newly discovered species might impact analyses performed today. We describe an approach that uses taxonomic history and phylogenetic trees to characterize the impact of past species discoveries on phylogenetic knowledge using patterns of branch-length variation, tree shape, and phylogenetic diversity. This provides a framework for assessing the relative completeness of taxonomic knowledge of lineages within a phylogeny. To demonstrate this approach, we use recent large phylogenies for amphibians, reptiles, flowering plants, and invertebrates.

28659,"Although major advances have been made during the past 20years in our understanding of the genetic and genomic consequences of polyploidy, our knowledge of polyploidy and the proteome is in its infancy. One of our goals is to stimulate additional study, particularly broad-scale proteomic analyses of polyploids and their progenitors. Although it may be too early to generalize regarding the extent to which transcriptomic data are predictive of the proteome of polyploids, it is clear that the proteome does not always reflect the transcriptome. Despite limited data, important observations on the proteomes of polyploids are emerging. In some cases, proteomic profiles show qualitatively and/or quantitatively non-additive patterns, and proteomic novelty has been observed. Allopolyploids generally combine the parental contributions, but there is evidence of parental dominance of one contributing genome in some allopolyploids. Autopolyploids are typically qualitatively identical to but quantitatively different from their parents. There is also evidence of parental legacy at the proteomic level. Proteomes clearly provide insights into the consequences of genomic merger and doubling beyond what is obtained from genomic and/or transcriptomic data. Translating proteomic changes in polyploids to differences in morphology and physiology remains the holy grail of polyploidy — this daunting task of linking genotype to proteome to phenotype should emerge as a focus of polyploidy research in the next decade.

These biodiversity challenges demand approaches that meld bioinformatics, largescale phylogeny reconstruction, use of digitized specimen data, and complex post-tree analyses (eg niche modeling, niche diversification, and other ecological analyses). Recent developments in phylogenetics coupled with emerging cyberinfrastructure and new data sources provide unparalleled opportunities for mobilizing and integrating massive amounts of biological data, driving the discovery of complex patterns and new hypotheses for further study. These developments are not trivial in that biodiversity data on the global scale now being collected and analyzed are inherently complex. The ongoing integration and maturation of biodiversity tools discussed here is transforming biodiversity science, enabling what we broadly term “nextgeneration” investigations in systematics, ecology, and evolution (ie,“biodiversity science”). New training that integrates domain knowledge in biodiversity and data science skills is also needed to accelerate research in these areas. Integrative biodiversity science is crucial to the future of global biodiversity.

28661,"Many phylogenomic studies based on transcriptomes have been limited to “single-copy” genes due to methodological challenges in homology and orthology inferences. Only a relatively small number of studies have explored analyses beyond reconstructing species relationships. We sampled 69 transcriptomes in the hyperdiverse plant clade Caryophyllales and 27 outgroups from annotated genomes across eudicots. Using a combined similarity-and phylogenetic tree-based approach, we recovered 10,960 homolog groups, where each was represented by at least eight ingroup taxa. By decomposing these homolog trees, and taking gene duplications into account, we obtained 17,273 ortholog groups, where each was represented by at least ten ingroup taxa. We reconstructed the species phylogeny using a 1,122-gene data set with a gene occupancy of 92.1%. From the homolog trees we found that both synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates in herbaceous lineages are up to three times as fast as in their woody relatives. This is the first time such a pattern has been shown across thousands of nuclear genes with dense taxon sampling. We also pinpointed regions of the Caryophyllales tree that were characterized by relatively high frequencies of gene duplication, including three previously unrecognized whole genome duplications.

28664,"Ferns are well known for their shade-dwelling habits. Their ability to thrive under low-light conditions has been linked to the evolution of a novel chimeric photoreceptor—neochrome—that fuses red-sensing phytochrome and blue-sensing phototropin modules into a single gene, thereby optimizing phototropic responses. Despite being implicated in facilitating the diversification of modern ferns, the origin of neochrome has remained a mystery. We present evidence for neochrome in hornworts (a bryophyte lineage) and demonstrate that ferns acquired neochrome from hornworts via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Fern neochromes are nested within hornwort neochromes in our large-scale phylogenetic reconstructions of phototropin and phytochrome gene families. Divergence date estimates further support the HGT hypothesis, with fern and hornwort neochromes diverging 179 Mya, long after the split between the two plant lineages (at least 400 Mya). By analyzing the draft genome of the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus, we also discovered a previously unidentified phototropin gene that likely represents the ancestral lineage of the neochrome phototropin module. Thus, a neochrome originating in hornworts was transferred horizontally to ferns, where it may have played a significant role in the diversification of modern ferns. phototropism| chloroplast movementPlant growth and development are modulated by photoreceptor systems that provide information about the surrounding environment.

28669,"The utility of 18S and 26S in broad phylogenetic analyses has been much maligned due in large part to the low signal in both genes. However, few analyses have employed complete 26S rDNA sequences over a broad range of taxa, and most alignments of the two genes are done de novo, without taking into account the secondary structure of the two rRNA genes. Here we mine next-generation sequence data to compile large matrices (429 taxa) of complete 18S+ 26S gene sequences, and we compare both de novo alignment methods with curated alignments done by eye that take into account secondary structure and hard-to-align regions (profile alignments). The combined 18S+ 26S topology is overall very similar to recently published gene trees for the angiosperms based on three or more genes. Overall support for the backbone or framework of the combined tree is low (bootstrap support below 50%). Few major clades have bootstrap support above 50%. Most well-supported clades are tip clades (families and orders sensu APG III 2009).

28675,"Ferns are one of the few remaining major clades of land plants for which a complete genome sequence is lacking. Knowledge of genome space in ferns will enable broad-scale comparative analyses of land plant genes and genomes, provide insights into genome evolution across green plants, and shed light on genetic and genomic features that characterize ferns, such as their high chromosome numbers and large genome sizes. As part of an initial exploration into fern genome space, we used a whole genome shotgun sequencing approach to obtain low-density coverage (~ 0.4 X to 2X) for six fern species from the Polypodiales (Ceratopteris, Pteridium, Polypodium, Cystopteris), Cyatheales (Plagiogyria), and Gleicheniales (Dipteris). We explore these data to characterize the proportion of the nuclear genome represented by repetitive sequences (including DNA transposons, retrotransposons, ribosomal DNA, and simple repeats) and protein-coding genes, and to extract chloroplast and mitochondrial genome sequences. Such initial sweeps of fern genomes can provide information useful for selecting a promising candidate fern species for whole genome sequencing. We also describe variation of genomic traits across our sample and highlight some differences and similarities in repeat structure between ferns and seed plants.",Paul G Wolf and Emily B Sessa and D Blaine Marchant and Fay-Wei Li and Carl J Rothfels and Erin M Sigel and Mathew A Gitzendanner and Clayton J Visger and Jo Ann Banks and Douglas E Soltis and Pamela S Soltis and Kathleen M Pryer and Joshua P Der,0,,,,,Botanical Society of America,An Exploration of Fern Genome Space,https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/fern_genome/1/,,2014,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:NMlhSUseqAsC

28677,"Allopolyploidization (hybridization and whole-genome duplication) is a common phenomenon in plant evolution with immediate saltational effects on genome structure and gene expression. New technologies have allowed rapid progress over the past decade in our understanding of the consequences of allopolyploidy. A major question, raised by early pioneer of this field Leslie Gottlieb, concerned the extent to which gene expression differences among duplicate genes present in an allopolyploid are a legacy of expression differences that were already present in the progenitor diploid species. Addressing this question necessitates phylogenetically well-understood natural study systems, appropriate technology, availability of genomic resources and a suitable analytical framework, including a sufficiently detailed and generally accepted terminology. Here, we review these requirements and illustrate their application to a natural study system that Gottlieb worked on and recommended for this purpose: recent allopolyploids of Tragopogon (Asteraceae). We reanalyse recent data from this system within the conceptual framework of parental legacies on duplicate gene expression in allopolyploids. On a broader level, we highlight the intellectual connection between Gottlieb’s phrasing of this issue and the more contemporary framework of cis-versus trans-regulation of duplicate gene expression in allopolyploid plants.",Jeremy E Coate and Richard JA Buggs and Jonathan F Wendel and Jeffrey J Doyle and Douglas E Soltis and Pamela S Soltis,0,,,,,,The legacy of diploid progenitors in allopolyploid gene,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.726.6415&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,2014,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:LXmCCkuhhTsC
28678,"Background: GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) genes encode signal transduction proteins with roles in a variety of biological processes in eukaryotes. In contrast to the low copy numbers observed in animals, GSK3 genes have expanded into a multi-gene family in land plants (embryophytes), and have also evolved functions in diverse plant specific processes, including floral development in angiosperms. However, despite previous efforts, the phylogeny of land plant GSK3 genes is currently unclear. Here, we analyze genes from a representative sample of phylogenetically pivotal taxa, including basal angiosperms, gymnosperms, and monilophytes, to reconstruct the evolutionary history and functional diversification of the GSK3 gene family in land plants. Results: Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses resolve a gene tree with four major gene duplication events that coincide with the emergence of novel land plant clades. The single GSK3 gene inherited from the ancestor of land plants was first duplicated along the ancestral branch to extant vascular plants, and three subsequent duplications produced three GSK3 loci in the ancestor of euphyllophytes, four in the ancestor of seed plants, and at least five in the ancestor of angiosperms. A single gene in the Amborella trichopoda genome may be the sole survivor of a sixth GSK3 locus that originated in the ancestor of extant angiosperms. Homologs of two Arabidopsis GSK3 genes with genetically confirmed roles in floral development, AtSK11 and AtSK12, exhibit floral preferential expression in several basal angiosperms, suggesting evolutionary conservation of their floral functions.

28681,"Few studies of global diversity gradients in plants exist, largely because the data are not available for all species involved. Instead, most global studies have focussed on vertebrates, as these taxa have historically been associated with the most complete data. Here, we address this shortfall by first investigating global diversity gradients in monocots, a morphologically and functionally diverse clade representing a quarter of flowering plant diversity, and then assessing congruence between monocot and vertebrate diversity patterns. To do this, we create a new dataset that merges biome-level associations for all monocot genera with country-level associations for almost all ∼70,000 species. We then assess the evidence for direct versus indirect effects of this plant diversity on vertebrate diversity using a combination of linear regression and structural equation modelling (SEM). Finally, we also calculate overlap of diversity hotspots for monocots and each vertebrate taxon. Monocots follow a latitudinal gradient although with pockets of extra-tropical diversity, mirroring patterns in vertebrates. Monocot diversity is positively associated with vertebrate diversity, but the strength of correlation varies depending on the clades being compared. Monocot diversity explains marginal amounts of variance (<10%) after environmental factors have been accounted for. However, correlations remain among model residuals, and SEMs apparently reveal some direct effects of monocot richness. Our results suggest that collinear responses to environmental gradients are behind much of the congruence observed, but that there is some evidence for direct effects of producer …",Lynsey Bunnefeld and F Andrew Jones and C David L Orme and Benjamin Sobkowiak and Timothy G Barraclough and Mark W Chase and Rafael Govaerts and Douglas E Soltis and Pamela S Soltis and Vincent Savolainen,0,,PLoS ONE,5,,Public Library of Science,Do Global Diversity Patterns of Vertebrates Reflect Those of Monocots?,http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/23735,8,2013,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:ynsZFq2pu0MC

28683,"Next-generation sequencing plays a central role in the characterization and quantification of transcriptomes. Although numerous metrics are purported to quantify the quality of RNA, there have been no large-scale empirical evaluations of the major determinants of sequencing success. We used a combination of existing and newly developed methods to isolate total RNA from 1115 samples from 695 plant species in 324 families, which represents. 900 million years of phylogenetic diversity from green algae through flowering plants, including many plants of economic importance. We then sequenced 629 of these samples on Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq platforms and performed a large comparative analysis to identify predictors of RNA quality and the diversity of putative genes (scaffolds) expressed within samples. Tissue types (eg, leaf vs. flower) varied in RNA quality, sequencing depth and the number of scaffolds. Tissue age also influenced RNA quality but not the number of scaffolds $1000 bp. Overall, 36% of the variation in the number of scaffolds was explained by metrics of RNA integrity (RIN score), RNA purity (OD 260/230), sequencing platform (GAIIx vs HiSeq) and the amount of total RNA used for sequencing. However, our results show that the most commonly used measures of RNA quality (eg, RIN) are weak predictors of the number of scaffolds because Illumina sequencing is robust to variation in RNA quality. These results provide novel insight into the methods that are most important in isolating high quality RNA for sequencing and assembling plant transcriptomes.

28685,"Background: Although it is agreed that a major polyploidy event, gamma, occurred within the eudicots, the phylogenetic placement of the event remains unclear.Results: To determine when this polyploidization occurred relative to speciation events in angiosperm history, we employed a phylogenomic approach to investigate the timing of gene set duplications located on syntenic gamma blocks. We populated 769 putative gene families with large sets of homologs obtained from public transcriptomes of basal angiosperms, magnoliids, asterids, and more than 91.8 gigabases of new next-generation transcriptome sequences of non-grass monocots and basal eudicots. The overwhelming majority (95%) of wellresolved gamma duplications was placed before the separation of rosids and asterids and after the split of monocots and eudicots, providing strong evidence that the gamma polyploidy event occurred early in eudicot evolution. Further, the majority of gene duplications was placed after the divergence of the Ranunculales and core eudicots, indicating that the gamma appears to be restricted to core eudicots. Molecular dating estimates indicate that the duplication events were intensely concentrated around 117 million years ago. Conclusions: The rapid radiation of core eudicot lineages that gave rise to nearly 75% of angiosperm species appears to have occurred coincidentally or shortly following the gamma triplication event. Reconciliation of gene trees with a species phylogeny can elucidate the timing of major events in genome evolution, even when genome sequences are only available for a subset of species represented in the gene trees …",Gane K Wong and Norman J Wickett and Daniel R Ruzicka and Jim Leebens-Mack and Michael K Deyholos and Claude W DePamphilis and Yeting Zhang and Andre S Chanderbali and Richard McCombie and Saravanaraj Ayyampalayam and Toni M Kutchan and Xiaolei Wu and Dennis W Stevenson and Eric Wafula and J Chris Pires and Joel McNeal and Yong Zhang and Jun Wang and Megan Rolf and Pamela S Soltis and Douglas E Soltis and Eric J Carpenter and YN Jiao and Michael R McKain and John E Bowers,0,,,,,,A Genome Triplication associated with early diversification of the core eudicots,https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/4d198758-13b1-4d96-9777-6f1ed903e67a/view/36c5fe02-ccf4-44a5-9d48-5a94daf4b454/A-20genome-20triplication-20associated-20with-20early-20diversification-20of-20the-20core-20eudicots.pdf,,2012,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:nU66GSXDKhoC

28693,"The principal aim of plant taxonomy has been to provide a system of classification based on evolutionary relationships. Most of the natural systems of plant classification have been based on exomorphic characters, placing greater emphasis on the characters of the flower as reproductive characters have been considered to be more important and conservative than the vegetative characters. However, since evolution has taken divergent courses in different groups of plants, with various characters showing difference in their extent and speed of evolutionary changes, the goal of attaining a truly natural system of classification remains unfulfilled. Hence, it is very essential to have a comprehensive knowledge of the concerned taxa from various aspects and various branches of botany like anatomy, embryology, cytology, phytochemistry, ultrastructure, etc. taking the advantage of the newly developed techniques of molecular biology and newer aspects of taxonomy like chemotaxonomy, cytotaxonomy, numerical taxonomy, etc., not only for the appropriate placement of taxa in the taxonomic systems but also to solve the discrepancies prevailing in the classification systems based on classical taxonomy. Thus, the'synthetic'approach has become the modern basis of plant classification, which evaluates all types of characters related to plant form, structure and function and which has helped reveal the mechanisms of evolution at various levels of taxonomic hierarchy. Many of the recent systems of classification such as those of Cronquist, Takhtajan and Dahlgren have utilized the synthetic approach and these newer evidences in deducing plant relationships …",KW Hilu and T Borsch and K Muller and DE Soltis and PS Soltis and V Savolainen and MW Chase and MP Powell and LA Alice,0,,Advanced Plant Taxonomy,,237,New Central Book Agency,CHP. 7 m SYSTEMS OF PLANT CLASSIFICATION,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3675738530529311754&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2009,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C

28698,"University of Florida, USA of living and fossil gymnosperms that the origin of the flower has long been a famous question in evolutionary biology. Numerous hypotheses based on morphological, developmental, and palaeobotanical studies have been proposed (reviewed in Stuessy, 2004). Most classic models view the flower as a compact strobilus (or ‘cone’), with floral parts derived from leaf-like organs. This strobiloid structure is evident in the flowers of Magnolia, in which perianth organs occur at the base of the strobilus, and stamens and carpels occupy more terminal positions. In most angiosperms, the floral axis has contracted, bringing tepals (or sepals and petals), stamens, and carpels closer together in a compact structure. Unfortunately, neither the gymnosperm progenitors nor any mechanisms for generating a flower-like structure are evident from the fossil record. How did the bisexual flower originate, especially given that nearly all gymnosperms, living and extinct, produce (or produced) unisexual cones? Molecular genetics is providing possible clues, spawning a number of recent hypotheses for the origin of the flower. The Mostly Male Theory (MMT; Frohlich and Parker, 2000) posits that the angiosperm flower may derive more from the male reproductive structure of the gymnosperm ancestor than from the female. This hypothesis is based on the observation that the LEAFY gene, which ‘tells’a vegetative shoot to become reproductive, is present in a single copy in angiosperms but occurs in two forms, LEAFY-male and LEAFY-female, in gymnosperms.

28699,"The origin and evolution of the flower have been intensively studied not only because of the great importance of flowers (and especially the fruits they produce) in providing human food, but also because of their crucial role in angiosperm sexual reproduction and many plant-animal interactions. The past centuries of morphologically and taxonomically based studies of flowers generated much information, but left some of the most critical questions of flower origin and evolution unresolved. Recent progress in understanding angiosperm (and seed plant) phylogeny provides a solid framework for evaluating evolutionary innovation, and identifies the taxa that provide the best insights into key innovations. The recent growth of developmental genetics provides exciting new data for understanding flower evolution; the interplay of developmental genetics with focused studies of morphology, development and phylogeny has generated a new field of study: the evolution of development (evo-devo). Evo-devo offers the best hope for rapid advance in the understanding of flower evolution. To appreciate this potential one must be cognizant of recent advances in all of these fields-phylogeny, morphology and developmental genetics-that are merging to create evo-devo.Here we describe recent progress in the study of floral evolution, beginning with advances in phylogeny and the reconstruction of trends in floral evolution.

28710,"The biota of the Hawaiian Islands has long been noted for many spectacular examples of adaptive radiation (Carlquist 1974; Wagner et al. 1990). As a result of moist northeasterly tradewinds and mountains over 3,000 m above sea level, these islands harbor a diversity of habitats that include dry deserts in rain-shadows with less than 1,250 mm precipitation per year, wet rain forests with more than 7,000 mm precipitation per year, and seasonally cold alpine habitats (Wagner et al. 1990). The landscape is even more diverse because of the effects of island age, with the erosion, subsidence, and eventual disappearance of islands formed for the past 70 million years by the Hawaiian volcanic “hot spot""(Wagner et al. 1990). Islands have been available for colonization far longer than the age of the current major Hawaiian Islands, which range in age from Kauai, formed about 5.7 million years ago (Mya) to the island of Hawai'i, formed less than 0.5 Mya (Macdonald et al. 1983). The great isolation of the archipelago (ca. 4,000 km from the nearest large land mass, North America) has sharply limited immigration, and the native flora of the Hawaiian Islands is the result of only 291 presumed colonists (Sakai et al. 1995a). Although two-thirds of the colonists are represented by only a single species (Sakai et al. 1995a), other colonizations led to large species-rich lineages, and the eight largest lineages (2.7% of colonists) account for 31.4% of the 971 current species.

Fifty years later, many of the questions Stebbins posed have not been answered, and many new questions have arisen. In this paper, we review some of the genetic attributes of polyploids that have been suggested to account for the tremendous success of polyploid plants. Based on a limited number of studies, we conclude:(i) Polyploids, both individuals and populations, generally maintain higher levels of heterozygosity than do their diploid progenitors,(ii) Polyploids exhibit less inbreeding depression than do their diploid parents and can therefore tolerate higher levels of selfing; polyploid ferns indeed have higher levels of selfing than do their diploid parents, but polyploid angiosperms do not differ in outcrossing rates from their diploid parents,(iii) Most polyploid species are polyphyletic, having formed recurrently from genetically different diploid parents. This mode of formation incorporates genetic diversity from multiple progenitor populations into the polyploid"" species""; thus, genetic diversity in polyploid species is much higher than expected",PAMELA S SOLTIS and DOUGLAS E SOLTIS,0,,Variation and evolution in plants and microorganisms: toward a new synthesis 50 years after Stebbins,,310,National Academies Press,Attributes in the Success of Polyploids,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13092598091498609440&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2000,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:oH8HCDhqVGsC

28719,"An analysis of the levels and distribution of allozyme variation in the Streptanthus glandulosus species complex was undertaken to test paradigms of speciation processes in the context of serpentine endemism. Electrophoretic analysis of 21 putative enzyme loci in 1,224 individuals representing 56 populations revealed extensive intrapopulational variation and interpopulational divergence. Estimates of gene flow among populations within taxa are typically lower than is theoretically needed to counteract the effects of genetic drift (ie, Nm values are below 0.5), suggesting that drift may play a significant role in the evolution of the complex. A cluster analysis of genetic identities between populations using UPGMA demonstrates geographically structured groupings, some of which include neighboring populations of different taxa. Moreover, the genetic identity between two populations is correlated with the distance by which they are separated. The results are consistent with a hypothesis of a paleoendemic origin of the complex. The ancestor of the complex (perhaps S. glandulosus ssp. glandulosus) probably was formerly distributed more continuously across serpentine and nonserpentine habitat throughout its range. Elimination of the nonserpentine populations allowed regional and population-level divergence, following a model of geographic speciation.Rare and endemic species are intrinsically fascinating to biologists.

28720,"Comparative DNA sequencing of matK, a maturase coding gene located within the intron of the chloroplast gene trnK, was evaluated for phylogenetic utility using genera of Saxifragaceae s. str. The entire matK gene was sequenced for two members of the family, Sullivantia sullivantii and Saxifraga integrifolia. Comparison of base substitution rates between these two species indicated that matK evolves approximately three-fold faster than rbcL. Comparative sequencing of 754 base pairs within matK was subsequently conducted using 25 genera in Saxifragaceae s. str. and two outgroup taxa. Summed over the 31 taxa sequenced for this 754 base pair region, 40% of the base positions were variable and 15.6% were potentially informative. Five insertion/deletion events of three or six base pairs were also detected. Skewness and randomization tests both suggest that significant non-random structure is present in the matK data set. Parsimony analyses provided 72 most parsimonious trees of 223 steps (excluding autapomorphies) with a consistency index of 0.565. Several well-supported groups of genera are highly concordant with relationships suggested by two other chloroplast DNA data sets: chloroplast DNA restriction sites and rbcL sequences.Because DNA sequencing is relatively fast, convenient, and offers a large data set of discrete characters, comparative DNA sequencing has become a widespread tool for phylogenetic reconstruction. In particular, the chloroplast gene rbcL has been widely used for inferring phylogeny at higher taxonomic levels (eg, Chase et al. 1993; Doebley et al. 1990; Donoghue et al. 1992; Giannasi et al. 1992; Kim …",Leigh A Johnson and Douglas E Soltis,0,,Systematic Botany,1,143-156,,access to Systematic Botany,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Douglas_Soltis/publication/262005956_matK_DNA_Sequences_and_Phylogenetic_Reconstruction_in_Saxifragaceae_s_str/links/57c49a6208ae5e5a8191bcdc.pdf,19,1994,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:NtCmTCuxid4C

Newer techniques, such as those associated with restriction fragment length polymorphisms, have recently gained much favour for the study of biological variation. Nevertheless, as this book amply demonstrates, there has been an enormous effort to study variation using isozymes in recent years, and analysis of phylogenetic relationships, for instance, will continue to be developed using these techniques.

28766,"Lamiales are one of the largest orders of flowering plants, with a worldwide distribution and more than 20,000 species from ca. 25 families. This hyper-diverse clade of life presents many exciting opportunities to investigate global patterns of radiation and to link these patterns to shifts in distribution, ecology, and phenotypic evolution. Unfortunately, comparative studies of Lamiales have proven somewhat intractable due to poor phylogenetic resolution. Progress has been made recently, however, with large-scale sampling of taxa and plastid genes (eg, over 17,000 bp of aligned sequence data); our understanding of interfamilial relationships is now much improved. Nevertheless, phylogenies based solely on plastid data provide a very biased view of Lamiales evolution, and nuclear data have been largely underexplored in studies of this diverse order. To address this issue, we employed a novel pipeline and marker discovery tool, MarkerMiner 1.0, and 76 transcriptomes from the One Thousand Plants Project (1kp) to identify a large set of single-copy nuclear (SCN) loci for a phylogenetic investigation of Lamiales. Our sampling included accessions from 18 of the 25 families of Lamiales (ie, Acanthaceae, Bignoniaceae, Byblidaceae, Calceolariaceae, Gesneriaceae, Gratiolaceae, Lamiaceae, Lentibulariaceae, Oleaceae, Orobanchaceae, Paulowniaceae, Pedaliaceae, Phrymaceae, Plantaginaceae, Schlegeliaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Tetrachondraceae, and Verbenaceae) and nine additional representative species from Boraginales, Gentianales, and Solanales.

28767,"Recent breakthroughs and technological advancements in molecular laboratory techniques, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and computational biology are arming systematic biologists with a new arsenal of powerful approaches and tools for phylogenetic applications. This arsenal provides an economical and efficient means for acquiring large datasets from both nuclear and organellar genomes that may help resolve many difficult phylogenetic problems, especially those for which 5-10 molecular markers fail to adequately resolve phylogeny; these methods also afford an opportunity to explore use of alternative phylogenetic approaches (eg, gene tree reconciliation) that facilitate the reconstruction of relationships despite possible discordances among individual gene histories. We selected Hedeoma and related New World genera in subtribe Menthinae (Lamiaceae)—a taxonomically problematic and difficult to resolve mint group—as a model system in which to test the efficacy of several new approaches for large-scale data acquisition on NGS platforms, marker development and targeted sequencing, and phylogenetics that may prove effective for resolving relationships across the remainder of the family. We present the first phylogenomic results for Lamiaceae, inferred from a maximum likelihood analysis of 96 nearly complete chloroplast genomes representing 53 accessions from Hedeoma and 43 taxa from 16 genera of New World Menthinae (Acanthomintha, Blephilia, Clinopodium, Conradina, Cunila, Dicerandra, Glechon, Hesperozygis, Kurzamra, Mentha, Monarda, Monardella, Poliomintha, Pycnanthemum, Rhabdocaulon, Rhododon …",GT Godden and MB Cortez and S Chamala and N García and DE Soltis and PS Soltis,0,,,,,,Out of the Bushes and Into the Trees: Next-generation Sequencing Approaches for Resolving the Phylogeny of Lamiaceae.,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Grant_Godden/publication/275892321_Out_of_the_Bushes_and_Into_the_Trees_Next-generation_Sequencing_Approaches_for_Resolving_the_Phylogeny_of_Lamiaceae/links/5571c92608aeb6d8c0159d8b.pdf,,,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:8RAEygVn5_EC

28769,"172 SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY VOL. 49 bootstrap replicate. Larger studies require use of partial searches (termed heuristic searches) that do not guarantee finding trees that are truly most parsimonious. Typically, at least several hundred pseudorepli-cates are examined, so the total time re-quired can easily become prohibitive as the number of taxa increases. Several different search strategies can be used to improve the chance that the best tree found will, in fact, be most parsimonious (summarized in Swofford et al., 1996); however, it is not possible to recognize the MPT even if it is found. The two primary tools used in heuristic searches are branch swapping and repeated attempts to start the branch-swapping process from different initial trees. Several different branch-swapping algo-rithms may be available, ranging from a simple nearest-neighbor-interchange (NNI) to a much more aggressive, and much more time …",MW CHASE and DE SOLTIS and RG OLMSTEAD,0,,Ann.

28770,"During the past decade, the tools of molecular biology have been applied to piant systematics with remarkable success. New insights have been gained into such topics as phylogenetic reconstruction, introgression, genomic evolution, and levels of genetic variation in natural populations. Molecular methods have provided greater resolution than was previously possible with other approaches. Moreover, variation in DNA sequences is more readily subjected to statistical analysis than many previous types of data, and it can be less ambiguous, making interpretation of data more straightforward. In this chapter, I review the application of molecular systematics to questions surrounding the origins and evolution of crop plants, specifically (1) identifying the progenitors of crops,(2) assaying levels of genetic variation in crops and their ancestors, and (3) determining the extent of introgression between crops and their …",Pamela S Soltis and Douglas E Soltís and Jeff J Doyle,0,,,,,,Molecular,https://teosinte.wisc.edu/pdfs/Soltis_Book_1992.pdf,,,,tQynSj0AAAAJ:M_lZXyI38BkC

28772,"3 strong conclusions regarding the fate of polyploids (as in Arrigo and Barker, 2012, in particular) should not be made. In fact, a recent paper by this team using the same methods finds the reverse—in fish, polyploids diversify at higher rates than diploids (see below). We stress again that there are methodological as well as sampling issues with Mayrose et al.(2011), which render their conclusions unjustified. In particular, we show that their main method is biased in several ways that have not been previously emphasized.MISSING LINKS FROM MAYROSE ET AL.(2011) We acknowledge that Soltis et al.(2014a) misinterpreted the error in Table S2 of Mayrose et al.(2011), and we are glad that the error has now been corrected. Similarly, a bug in Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison, 2015) has now been fixed. Lastly, the details provided in Mayrose et al.(2014) make the methods of data cleansing much more transparent and allay many of the concerns about inconsistencies highlighted in Soltis et al. 2014.
