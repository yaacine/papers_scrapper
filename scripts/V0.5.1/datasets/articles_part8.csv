8019,"The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN promises a major step forward in the understanding of the fundamental nature of matter. The ATLAS experiment is a general-purpose detector for the LHC, whose design was guided by the need to accommodate the wide spectrum of possible physics signatures.

In the focus are the investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking and linked to this the search for the Higgs boson as well as the search for Physics beyond the Standard Model. In this report a detailed examination of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector is provided, with a major aim being to investigate the experimental sensitivity to a wide range of measurements and potential observations of new physical processes.

Theoretical calculations of this process extend to next-to-leading order (NLO)[2–4] and next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO)[5–9] perturbation theory. Crucial ingredients of the resulting QCD cross section calculations are the parametrizations of the momentum distribution functions of partons in the proton (PDFs). These have been determined recently in a variety of phenomenological analyses to NLO QCD by the CTEQ [10, 11] group and to NNLO by the MSTW [12], ABKM [13, 14], HERAPDF [15, 16], JR [17], and NNPDF [18, 19] groups.

The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.",Georges Aad and B Abbott and J Abdallah and AA Abdelalim and Abdelmalek Abdesselam and B Abi and M Abolins and H Abramowicz and H Abreu and E Acerbi and BS Acharya and M Ackers and DL Adams and TN Addy and J Adelman and M Aderholz and S Adomeit and P Adragna and T Adye and S Aefsky and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and M Aharrouche and SP Ahlen and F Ahles and A Ahmad and M Ahsan and G Aielli and T Akdogan and TPA Åkesson and G Akimoto and AV Akimov and MS Alam and MA Alam and S Albrand and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and M Aleppo and F Alessandria and C Alexa and G Alexander and G Alexandre and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and M Aliev and G Alimonti and J Alison and M Aliyev and PP Allport and SE Allwood-Spiers and J Almond and A Aloisio and R Alon and A Alonso and J Alonso and MG Alviggi and K Amako and P Amaral and C Amelung and VV Ammosov and A Amorim and G Amoros and N Amram and C Anastopoulos and T Andeen and CF Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and ML Andrieux and XS Anduaga and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and N Anjos and A Annovi and A Antonaki and M Antonelli and S Antonelli and J Antos and F Anulli and S Aoun and L Aperio Bella and R Apolle and G Arabidze and I Aracena and Y Arai and ATH Arce and JP Archambault and S Arfaoui and JF Arguin and E Arik and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and KE Arms and SR Armstrong and O Arnaez and C Arnault and A Artamonov and G Artoni and D Arutinov and S Asai and J Silva and R Asfandiyarov and S Ask and B Åsman and L Asquith and K Assamagan and A Astbury and A Astvatsatourov and G Atoian and B Aubert and B Auerbach and E Auge and K Augsten and M Aurousseau and N Austin and R Avramidou and D Axen and C Ay and G Azuelos and Y Azuma and MA Baak and G Baccaglioni and C Bacci and AM Bach and H Bachacou and K Bachas and G Bachy and M Backes and E Badescu and P Bagnaia and S Bahinipati and Y Bai and DC Bailey and T Bain and JT Baines and OK Baker and S Baker and F Baltasar Dos Santos Pedrosa and E Banas and P Banerjee and Sw Banerjee and D Banfi and A Bangert and V Bansal and HS Bansil and L Barak and SP Baranov and A Barashkou and A Barbaro Galtieri and T Barber,1500,10374830077736851981,Physical review letters,25,252303,American Physical Society,Observation of a Centrality-Dependent Dijet Asymmetry in Lead-Lead Collisions at  with the ATLAS Detector at the LHC,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.252303,105,2010,/scholar?cites=10374830077736851981,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:W7OEmFMy1HYC

Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections.

Events are selected in two different topologies: single lepton (electron e or muon μ) with large missing transverse energy and at least four jets, and dilepton (ee, μμ or eμ) with large missing transverse energy and at least two jets. In a data sample of 2.9 pb−1, 37 candidate events are observed in the single-lepton topology and 9 events in the dilepton topology. The corresponding expected backgrounds from non- Standard Model processes are estimated using data-driven methods and determined to be 12.2±3.9 events and 2.5±0.6 events, respectively.

8045,"Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral collisions, corresponding to 0–5% and 70–80% of the hadronic Pb–Pb cross section. The measured charged particle spectra in| η|< 0.8 and 0.3< p T< 20 GeV/c are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same s NN, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon–nucleon collisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor R AA. The result indicates only weak medium effects (R AA≈ 0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, R AA reaches a minimum of about 0.14 at p T= 6–7 GeV/c and increases significantly at larger p T.

In the most central events, where the elliptic flow v 2 and v 3 have similar magnitude, a double peaked structure in the two-particle azimuthal correlations is observed, which is often interpreted as a Mach cone response to fast partons.

The combined LEP data show no significant excess of events which would indicate the production of Higgs bosons. The search results are used to set upper bounds on the cross-sections of various Higgs-like event topologies.

8067,"This Letter presents a measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section using 60 μ b− 1 of p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy s of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Inelastic interactions are selected using rings of plastic scintillators in the forward region (2.07<| η|< 3.86) of the detector. A cross section of 68.1±1.4 mb is measured in the fiducial region ξ= M X 2/s> 10− 6, where M X is the larger invariant mass of the two hadronic systems separated by the largest rapidity gap in the event.

8068,"The Tile hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS detector has undergone extensive testing in the experimental hall since its installation in late 2005. The readout, control and calibration systems have been fully operational since 2007 and the detector has successfully collected data from the LHC single beams in 2008 and first collisions in 2009. This paper gives an overview of the Tile Calorimeter performance as measured using random triggers, calibration data, data from cosmic ray muons and single beam data. The detector operation status, noise characteristics and performance of the calibration systems are presented, as well as the validation of the timing and energy calibration carried out with minimum ionising cosmic ray muons data.

8075,"The algorithms used by the ATLAS Collaboration to reconstruct and identify prompt photons are described. Measurements of the photon identification efficiencies are reported, using 4.9 fb of pp collision data collected at the LHC at   and 20.3 fb at  . The efficiencies are measured separately for converted and unconverted photons, in four different pseudorapidity regions, for transverse momenta between 10  and 1.5 .

The measured J/ψ yield, normalized to the number of binary nucleon–nucleon collisions, is found to significantly decrease from peripheral to central collisions.

Some models with supersymmetry also predict charginos with a significant lifetime.

During his term as spokesperson for B 八 B 八 R he laid down a vision for the two B Factory detector collaborations, B 八 B 八 R and Belle, to work together on a book that would describe the methodologies used and physics results obtained by those experiments. A key ideal emphasized from the outset was that this book should be written from a pedagogical perspective; it should be of interest to the student and expert alike. This vision was presented during a B 八 B 八 R collaboration meeting on the island of Elba in May 2008 and a follow up Belle collaboration meeting at KEK, with visiting colleagues from the B 八 B 八 R collaboration, and was embraced by the community. A number of workshops involving people from the theoretical community as well as the two collaborations were held on four continents over the following years. The resulting book,“The Physics of the B Factories”, is a testament to the way that this concept captured the zeitgeist on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.This book is divided into three parts, the first of which provides a brief description of the B Factories, including a short (though not exhaustive) historical perspective, as well as descriptions of the detectors, ancillary data acquisition systems and data (re) processing systems that were built by the two detector collaborations in the late 1990’s.

8109,"A search for evidence of invisible-particle decay modes of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. No deviation from the standard model expectation is observed in 4.5 fb− 1 (20.3 fb− 1) of 7 (8) TeV p p collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. Assuming the standard model rate for Z H production, an upper limit of 75%, at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio to invisible-particle decay modes of the Higgs boson at a mass of 125.5 GeV. The limit on the branching ratio is also interpreted in terms of an upper limit on the allowed dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section within a Higgs-portal dark matter scenario. Within the constraints of such a scenario, the results presented in this Letter provide the strongest available limits for low-mass dark matter candidates.

Centrality classes are defined by using different event-activity estimators, ie, charged-particle multiplicities measured in three different pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy measured at beam rapidity (zero degree). The procedures to determine the centrality, quantified by the number of participants (N part) or the number of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions (N coll) are described.

8125,"A search is presented for the pair production of heavy vector-like T quarks, primarily targeting the T quark decays to a W boson and a b-quark. The search is based on 36.1 fb− 1 of pp collisions at TeV recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, including at least one b-tagged jet and a large-radius jet identified as originating from the hadronic decay of a high-momentum W boson. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed in the reconstructed T mass distribution.

8142,"The observation of neutrino oscillations is clear evidence for physics beyond the standard model. To make precise measurements of this phenomenon, neutrino oscillation experiments, including MiniBooNE, require an accurate description of neutrino charged current quasielastic (CCQE) cross sections to predict signal samples. Using a high-statistics sample of ν μ CCQE events, MiniBooNE finds that a simple Fermi gas model, with appropriate adjustments, accurately characterizes the CCQE events observed in a carbon-based detector. The extracted parameters include an effective axial mass, M A eff= 1.23±0.20 GeV, that describes the four-momentum dependence of the axial-vector form factor of the nucleon, and a Pauli-suppression parameter, κ= 1.019±0.011.

In particular, the Kraków and EPOS models give a satisfactory description of the data, with the latter covering a wider p T range. Mid-rapidity yields, integrated over p T, have been determined. The hyperon-to-pion ratios are similar to those at RHIC: they rise smoothly with centrality up to< N part>∼ 150 and saturate thereafter.

The v 2 is reported for π±, K±, K S 0,, ϕ,, and in several collision centralities.

8160,"Measurements of multiparticle azimuthal correlations (cumulants) for charged particles in p-Pb at s NN= 5.02 TeV and Pb-Pb at s NN= 2.76 TeV collisions are presented. They help address the question of whether there is evidence for global, flowlike, azimuthal correlations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the larger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the second harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity, characteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions. However, when a| Δ η| gap is placed to suppress such correlations, the two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high multiplicity, indicating the presence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the p-Pb values at similar multiplicities.

8178,"The results of a search for the top squark, the supersymmetric partner of the top quark, in final states with one isolated electron or muon, jets, and missing transverse momentum are reported. The search uses the 2015 LHC pp  collision data at a center-of-mass energy of s  √ =13  TeV  recorded by the ATLAS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2  fb −1  . The analysis targets two types of signal models: gluino-mediated pair production of top squarks with a nearly mass-degenerate top squark and neutralino and direct pair production of top squarks, decaying to the top quark and the lightest neutralino. The experimental signature in both signal scenarios is similar to that of a top quark pair produced in association with large missing transverse momentum. No significant excess over the Standard Model background prediction is observed, and exclusion limits on gluino and top squark masses are set at 95% confidence level. The results extend the LHC run-1 exclusion limit on the gluino mass up to 1460 GeV in the gluino-mediated scenario in the high gluino and low top squark mass region and add an excluded top squark mass region from 745 to 780 GeV for the direct top squark model with a massless lightest neutralino.

The measurements are performed in the central pseudorapidity region| η|< 0.8 and for the transverse momentum range 0.2< p T< 5 GeV/c. The anisotropic flow is measured using two-particle correlations with a pseudorapidity gap greater than one unit and with the multiparticle cumulant method.

This article presents the results of a search for events containing at least one long-lived particle that decays at a significant distance from its production point into two leptons or into five or more charged particles. This analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at s= 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb− 1 collected in 2012 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. No events are observed in any of the signal regions, and limits are set on model parameters within supersymmetric scenarios involving R-parity violation, split supersymmetry, and gauge mediation.

An excess of events over the expected background from Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 4.1 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 2.8 standard deviations. The best fit for the t¯tH production cross section is σ(t¯tH)=790 +230 −210 fb, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of 507 +35−50 fb. The combination of this result with other t¯tH searches from the ATLAS experiment using the Higgs boson decay modes to b¯b, γγ and ZZ* → 4l, has an observed significance of 4.2 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 3.8 standard deviations. This provides evidence for the t¯tH production mode.",BMM Allbrooke and L Asquith and A Cerri and CA Chavez Barajas and I Santoyo Castillo and K Suruliz and MR Sutton and I Vivarelli,240,9196104735825460959,Physical Review D,7,072003,American Physical Society,Evidence for the associated production of the Higgs boson and a top quark pair with the ATLAS detector,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9196104735825460959&hl=en&oi=scholarr,97,2018,/scholar?cites=9196104735825460959,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:xGR4dRACcPQC

They are based on 20.3 fb−1 of pp collision data, produced at √s = 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy at the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS detector. The differential measurements are performed in bins of transverse momentum and rapidity of the four-lepton system, the invariant mass of the subleading lepton pair and the decay angle of the leading lepton pair with respect to the beam line in the four-lepton rest frame, as well as the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the leading jet.

Trigger-rate based monitoring of beam-related backgrounds is presented. The correlations of backgrounds with machine conditions, such as residual pressure in the beam-pipe, are discussed. Results from dedicated beam-background simulations are shown, and their qualitative agreement with data is evaluated. Data taken during the passage of unpaired, i.e. non-colliding, proton bunches is used to obtain background-enriched data samples. These are used to identify characteristic features of beam-induced backgrounds, which then are exploited to develop dedicated background tagging tools. These tools, based on observables in the Pixel detector, the muon spectrometer and the calorimeters, are described in detail and their efficiencies are evaluated.

New searches use vector-boson fusion production, initial-state radiation jets, and low-momentum lepton final states, as well as multivariate analysis techniques to improve the sensitivity to scenarios with small mass splittings and low-production cross sections. Results are based on 20 fb− 1 of proton-proton collision data at s= 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess beyond Standard Model expectations is observed. The new and existing searches are combined and interpreted in terms of 95% confidence-level exclusion limits in simplified models, where a single …",Georges Aad and B Abbott and J Abdallah and R Aben and M Abolins and OS AbouZeid and H Abramowicz and H Abreu and R Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and L Adamczyk and DL Adams and J Adelman and S Adomeit and T Adye and AA Affolder and T Agatonovic-Jovin and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and SP Ahlen and F Ahmadov and G Aielli and H Akerstedt and TPA Åkesson and AV Akimov and GL Alberghi and J Albert and S Albrand and MJ Alconada Verzini and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and C Alexa and G Alexander and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and G Alimonti and L Alio and J Alison and SP Alkire and BMM Allbrooke and PP Allport and A Aloisio and A Alonso and F Alonso and C Alpigiani and A Altheimer and B Alvarez Gonzalez and D Álvarez Piqueras and MG Alviggi and BT Amadio and K Amako and Y Amaral Coutinho and C Amelung and D Amidei and SP Amor Dos Santos and A Amorim and S Amoroso and N Amram and G Amundsen and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and G Anders and JK Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and S Angelidakis and I Angelozzi and P Anger and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and AV Anisenkov and N Anjos and A Annovi and M Antonelli and A Antonov and J Antos and DJ Antrim and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and G Arabidze and Y Arai and JP Araque and ATH Arce and FA Arduh and JF Arguin and S Argyropoulos and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and O Arnaez and H Arnold and M Arratia and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Asai and N Asbah and A Ashkenazi and B Åsman and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and K Augsten and M Aurousseau and G Avolio and B Axen and MK Ayoub and G Azuelos and MA Baak and AE Baas and MJ Baca and C Bacci and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and M Backhaus and P Bagiacchi and P Bagnaia and Y Bai and T Bain and JT Baines and OK Baker and EM Baldin and P Balek and T Balestri and F Balli and WK Balunas and E Banas and Sw Banerjee and AAE Bannoura and L Barak and EL Barberio and D Barberis and M Barbero and T Barillari and M Barisonzi and T Barklow and N Barlow and SL Barnes and BM Barnett and RM Barnett and Z Barnovska and A Baroncelli and G Barone,215,15658523213299201965,Physical Review D,5,052002,American Physical Society,Search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in   collisions with the ATLAS detector,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.052002,93,2016,/scholar?cites=15658523213299201965,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:lDkwdCLiKhwC
8234,The differential cross-section for pair production of top quarks with high transverse momentum is measured in 20.3 fb− 1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The measurement is performed for t t events in the lepton+ jets channel.

The hadronically decaying top quark is reconstructed as an anti-k t jet with radius parameter R= 1.0 and identified with jet substructure techniques.

8237,"A measurement of angular correlations in Drell–Yan lepton pairs via the φ ∗ η observable is presented. This variable probes the same physics as the Z/γ ∗ boson transverse momentum with a better experimental resolution. The Z/γ ∗ → e+e− and Z/γ ∗ → μ+μ− decays produced in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 7 TeV are used. The data were collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb−1. Normalised differential cross sections as a function of φ ∗ η are measured separately for electron and muon decay channels. These channels are then combined for improved accuracy. The cross section is also measured double differentially as a function of φ ∗ η for three independent bins of the Z boson rapidity. The results are compared to QCD calculations and to predictions from different Monte Carlo event generators. The data are reasonably well described, in all measured Z boson rapidity regions, by resummed QCD predictions combined with fixed-order perturbative QCD calculations or by some Monte Carlo event generators.

8241,"Measurements of the centrality and rapidity dependence of inclusive jet production in s NN= 5.02 TeV proton–lead (p+ Pb) collisions and the jet cross-section in s= 2.76 TeV proton–proton collisions are presented. These quantities are measured in datasets corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 27.8 nb− 1 and 4.0 pb− 1, respectively, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2013.

Results are presented for the double-differential per-collision yields as a function of jet rapidity and transverse momentum (p T) for minimum-bias and centrality-selected p+ Pb collisions, and are compared to the jet rate from the geometric expectation.

8246,This article reports on a search for dark matter pair production in association with bottom or top quarks in  of  collisions collected at  TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events with large missing transverse momentum are selected when produced in association with high-momentum jets of which one or more are identified as jets containing -quarks. Final states with top quarks are selected by requiring a high jet multiplicity and in some cases a single lepton. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectations and limits are set on the mass scale of effective field theories that describe scalar and tensor interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles. Limits on the dark-matter–nucleon cross-section for spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions are also provided. These limits are particularly strong for low-mass dark matter.

8258,"A measurement of the multi-strange Ξ− and Ω− baryons and their antiparticles by the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented for inelastic proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The transverse momentum (p T) distributions were studied at mid-rapidity (| y|< 0.5) in the range of 0.6< p T< 8.5 GeV/c for Ξ− and Ξ¯+ baryons, and in the range of 0.8< p T< 5 GeV/c for Ω− and Ω¯+.

8260,"In quantum chromodynamics (QCD) the production process of b hadrons can be divided into two steps, assuming factorisation: a hard process for b production and a soft process to describe hadronisation. The hard process can be predicted by perturbative calculations in QCD; the soft process is parameterised by the fragmentation function, which has large uncertainties due to nonperturbative QCD contributions. The study of the production of b hadrons tests the factorisation ansatz. The ground state of the b-baryon family, Λ0 b, has a wide range of decay modes. The study of its production and decays can offer complementary information to that obtained from the study of B mesons. The kinematic dependence of the production of Λ0 b baryons relative to that of B mesons can test differences in the b quark hadronisation process between the two [1, 2].

This Letter reports a measurement of the momentum distribution of π 0 s produced in mineral oil (CH 2) and the first observation of coherent π 0 production below 2 GeV. In the forward direction, the yield of events observed above the expectation for resonant production is attributed primarily to coherent production off carbon, but may also include a small contribution from diffractive production on hydrogen.

8278,"This paper describes the implementation and performance of a particle flow algorithm applied to 20.2 fb of ATLAS data from 8 TeV proton–proton collisions in Run 1 of the LHC. The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in resolution and …",Morad Aaboud and G Aad and B Abbott and J Abdallah and B Abeloos and SH Abidi and OS AbouZeid and NL Abraham and H Abramowicz and H Abreu and R Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and S Adachi and L Adamczyk and J Adelman and M Adersberger and T Adye and AA Affolder and T Agatonovic-Jovin and C Agheorghiesei and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and SP Ahlen and F Ahmadov and G Aielli and S Akatsuka and H Akerstedt and TPA Åkesson and AV Akimov and GL Alberghi and J Albert and MJ Alconada Verzini and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and C Alexa and G Alexander and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and B Ali and M Aliev and G Alimonti and J Alison and SP Alkire and BMM Allbrooke and BW Allen and PP Allport and A Aloisio and A Alonso and F Alonso and C Alpigiani and AA Alshehri and M Alstaty and B Alvarez Gonzalez and D Álvarez Piqueras and MG Alviggi and BT Amadio and Y Amaral Coutinho and C Amelung and D Amidei and SP Amor Dos Santos and A Amorim and S Amoroso and G Amundsen and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and JK Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and S Angelidakis and I Angelozzi and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and AV Anisenkov and N Anjos and A Annovi and C Antel and M Antonelli and A Antonov and DJ Antrim and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and G Arabidze and Y Arai and JP Araque and V Araujo Ferraz and ATH Arce and RE Ardell and FA Arduh and J-F Arguin and S Argyropoulos and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and LJ Armitage and O Arnaez and H Arnold and M Arratia and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Artz and S Asai and N Asbah and A Ashkenazi and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and K Augsten and G Avolio and B Axen and MK Ayoub and G Azuelos and AE Baas and MJ Baca and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and M Backhaus and P Bagiacchi and P Bagnaia and H Bahrasemani and JT Baines and M Bajic and OK Baker and EM Baldin and P Balek and T Balestri and F Balli and WK Balunas and E Banas and Sw Banerjee and AAE Bannoura and L Barak and EL Barberio and D Barberis and M Barbero and T Barillari and M-S Barisits and T Barklow and N Barlow and SL Barnes and BM Barnett and RM Barnett and Z Barnovska-Blenessy,177,352851877315860265,The European Physical Journal C,7,466,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Jet reconstruction and performance using particle flow with the ATLAS Detector,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5031-2,77,2017,/scholar?cites=352851877315860265,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:_F52mrgXcGcC

The search employs techniques for reconstructing decay vertices of long-lived particles decaying to jets in the inner tracking detector and muon spectrometer. Signal events require at least two reconstructed vertices.

It is based on an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb− 1 of pp collisions at TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The final state of interest is a disappearing track accompanied by at least one jet with high transverse momentum from initial-state radiation or by four jets from the gluino decay chain. The use of short track segments reconstructed from the innermost tracking layers significantly improves the sensitivity to short chargino lifetimes. The results are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions. Exclusion limits are set at 95% confidence level on the mass of charginos and gluinos for different chargino lifetimes. For a pure wino with a lifetime of about 0.2 ns, chargino masses up to 460 GeV are excluded.

This Upgrade, which will be installed in Long Shutdown 4 of the LHC (2030), will build on the strengths of the current experiment and the Phase-I Upgrade, but will consist of re-designed sub-systems that can operate at a luminosity of 2× 1034 cm− 2s− 1, ten times that of the Phase-I Upgrade detector. New and improved detector components will increase the intrinsic performance of the experiment in certain key areas. In particular the installation of a tungsten sampling electromagnetic calorimeter will widen LHCb’s capabilities for decays involving π0 and η mesons, electrons, and photons from loop-level penguin processes. The physics motivation is presented, and the prospects for operating the LHCb Interaction Point at high luminosity are assessed.

8430,"The standard model of particle physics describes the fundamental particles and their interactions via the strong, electromagnetic and weak forces. It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson (B-s(0)) and the B-0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (mu(+) and mu(-)) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the B-s(0)->mu(+)mu(-) and B-0 ->mu(+)mu(-) decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion B-s(0) mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B-0 mesons(1). A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN2 started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb(Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton-proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts.

8436,"Differences in the behaviour of matter and antimatter have been observed in K and B meson decays, but not yet in any baryon decay. Such differences are associated with the non-invariance of fundamental interactions under the combined charge-conjugation and parity transformations, known as CP violation.

These four-body hadronic decays are a promising place to search for sources of CP violation both within and beyond the standard model of particle physics.

8437,"The angular distributions of Drell-Yan charged lepton pairs in the vicinity of the Z-boson mass peak probe the underlying QCD dynamics of Z-boson production. This paper presents a measurement of the complete set of angular coefficients A 0− 7 describing these distributions in the Z-boson Collins-Soper frame. The data analysed correspond to 20.3 fb− 1 of pp collisions at TeV, collected by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC. The measurements are compared to the most precise fixed-order calculations currently available and with theoretical predictions embedded in Monte Carlo generators.

The resulting spin model is consistent with a transition from three-sublattice long-range magnetic order to an insulating spin-liquid phase, and with a jump of the double occupancy at the transition. Exact diagonalizations of both models show that the effective spin model is quantitatively accurate well into the spin-liquid phase, and a comparison with the Gutzwiller projected Fermi sea suggests a gapless spectrum and a spinon Fermi surface.",Hong-Yu Yang and Andreas M Läuchli and Frédéric Mila and Kai Phillip Schmidt,117,11976169179286669322,Physical review letters,26,267204,American Physical Society,Effective spin model for the spin-liquid phase of the Hubbard model on the triangular lattice,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.105.267204,105,2010,/scholar?cites=11976169179286669322,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:2fSfPE3k374C
8447,"Searches for dijet resonances with sub-TeV masses using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider can be statistically limited by the bandwidth available to inclusive single-jet triggers, whose data-collection rates at low transverse momentum are much lower than the rate from standard model multijet production. This Letter describes a new search for dijet resonances where this limitation is overcome by recording only the event information calculated by the jet trigger algorithms, thereby allowing much higher event rates with reduced storage needs. The search targets low-mass dijet resonances in the range 450–1800 GeV. The analyzed data set has an integrated luminosity of up to 29.3 fb− 1 and was recorded at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

Using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulations that self-consistently include the dynamical interaction between cosmic rays (CRs) and thermal gas and anisotropic CR diffusion along the magnetic field lines, we show that the key characteristics of the observed gamma-ray bubbles and the spatially correlated X-ray features in the ROSAT 1.5 keV map can be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active galactic nucleus.

8457,"A search for strongly produced supersymmetric particles using signatures involving multiple energetic jets and either two isolated same-sign leptons (e or mu), or at least three isolated leptons, is presented. The analysis relies on the identification of b-jets and high missing transverse momentum to achieve good sensitivity. A data sample of proton-proton collisions at root s= 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb (-1), is used for the search. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. The results are interpreted in several simplified supersymmetric models featuring R-parity conservation or R-parity violation, extending the exclusion limits from previous searches. In models considering gluino pair production, gluino masses are excluded up to 1.87 TeV at 95% confidence level. When bottom squarks are pair-produced and decay to a chargino and a top quark, models with bottom squark masses below 700 GeV and light neutralinos are excluded at 95% confidence level.

The contribution of electrons from background sources was subtracted using an invariant mass approach.

Electrons not originating from semi-electronic decay of beauty hadrons are suppressed using the impact parameter of the corresponding tracks.

8504,"In high-energy collisions, the spatio-temporal size of the particle production region can be measured using the Bose–Einstein correlations of identical bosons at low relative momentum. The source radii are typically extracted using two-pion correlations, and characterize the system at the last stage of interaction, called kinetic freeze-out. In low-multiplicity collisions, unlike in high-multiplicity collisions, two-pion correlations are substantially altered by background correlations, e.g. mini-jets. Such correlations can be suppressed using three-pion cumulant correlations. We present the first measurements of the size of the system at freeze-out extracted from three-pion cumulant correlations in pp, p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC with ALICE.

8520,"We report on the measurement of the inclusive ϒ (1 S) production in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV carried out at forward rapidity (2.5< y< 4) and down to zero transverse momentum using its μ+ μ− decay channel with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A strong suppression of the inclusive ϒ (1 S) yield is observed with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of independent nucleon–nucleon collisions. The nuclear modification factor, for events in the 0–90% centrality range, amounts to 0.30±0.05 (stat)±0.04 (syst). The observed ϒ (1 S) suppression tends to increase with the centrality of the collision and seems more pronounced than in corresponding mid-rapidity measurements.

8527,"Measurements of normalized differential cross sections of top quark pair (t t) production are presented as a function of the mass, the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the t t system in proton-proton collisions at center-of-mass energies of s= 7 and 8 TeV. The data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb− 1 at 7 TeV and 20.2 fb− 1 at 8 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Events with top quark pair signatures are selected in the dilepton final state, requiring exactly two charged leptons and at least two jets with at least one of the jets identified as likely to contain a b hadron.

We find that these microphysical effects can have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors, depending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the CR streaming instability, CRs propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on self-excited Alfvén waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to the streaming instability is …",Mateusz Ruszkowski and H-Y Karen Yang and Ellen Zweibel,92,3231655707579141410,The Astrophysical Journal,2,208,IOP Publishing,Global simulations of galactic winds including cosmic-ray streaming,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/208/meta,834,2017,/scholar?cites=3231655707579141410,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:siyhzxQqG3sC
8553,"Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is believed to prevent catastrophic cooling in galaxy clusters. However, how the feedback energy is transformed into heat, and how the AGN jets heat the intracluster medium (ICM) isotropically, still remain elusive. In this work, we gain insights into the relative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet feedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms of reproducing the properties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two"" jet cones""(within~ 30 from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains entropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.

8579,"A detailed study of multiparticle azimuthal correlations is presented using p p data at s= 5.02 and 13 TeV, and p+ Pb data at s NN= 5.02 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The azimuthal correlations are probed using four-particle cumulants c n {4} and flow coefficients v n {4}=(− c n {4}) 1/4 for n= 2 and 3, with the goal of extracting long-range multiparticle azimuthal correlation signals and suppressing the short-range correlations.

8616,"The Standard Model (SM) predicts self-couplings of the W boson, the Z boson and the photon through the non-Abelian SU (2) L× U (1) Y gauge group of the electroweak sector. Experimental tests of these predictions have been made in p p and pp collider experiments through the s-channel production of one of the gauge bosons and its subsequent coupling to a final state boson pair such as WW, WZ, and W γ (s-channel production of ZZ and Zγ are forbidden in the SM). The production cross sections are sensitive to the couplings at the triple gauge-boson (TGC) vertices and therefore provide direct tests of SM predictions. Deviations of the TGC from the SM expectation could occur from a composite structure of the W and Z bosons, or from the presence of new bosons that decay to SM vector boson pairs. Previous measurements of W γ and Zγ production have been made at the Tevatron by the CDF [1] and D0 [2, 3] Collaborations, and at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS [4] and CMS [5] Collaborations. In this Letter we report measurements of the production of W γ and Zγ boson pairs from pp collisions provided by the LHC, at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The analysis presented here uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.02 fb− 1 collected by the ATLAS experiment in the first half of 2011. Events triggered by high transverse energy (ET) electrons and high transverse momentum (pT) muons are used to select pp→ l± νγ+ X and pp→ l+l− γ+ X production.

A method was proposed to measure the screw and edge dislocation densities by XRD. It was found that the buffer layer thickness was a key parameter to affect the quality of GaN epilayer and an appropriate thickness resulted in the best structural and optical properties except the lateral grain size. After the thickness exceeding the appropriate value, the compressive stress in the epilayer decreased as the thickness increased, which led to the redshift of the near-band edge luminescence.

Using an unbinned likelihood fit with a Lorentz-violating oscillation model derived from the Standard Model Extension (SME) to describe any excess events over background, we find that the ν e appearance data prefer a sidereal time-independent solution, and the ν¯ e appearance data slightly prefer a sidereal time-dependent solution.

8647,"The performance of identification algorithms (“taggers”) for hadronically decaying top quarks and W bosons in pp collisions at  = 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. A set of techniques based on jet shape observables are studied to determine a set of optimal cut-based taggers for use in physics analyses.

An inclusive charged jet transverse momentum cross section measurement from 4 GeV to 100 GeV is shown for four ranges in rapidity extending to 1.9 and corrected to charged particle-level truth jets. The transverse momenta and longitudinal momentum fractions of charged particles within jets are measured, along with the charged particle multiplicity and the particle density as a function of radial distance from the jet axis.

Absolute distance was determined by counting the interference fringes produced while scanning the laser frequency. A high-finesse Fabry–Perot interferometer was used to determine frequency changes during scanning. Two multiple-distance-measurement analysis techniques were developed to improve distance precision and to extract the amplitude and frequency of vibrations. Under laboratory conditions, measurement precision of ∼50 nm was achieved for absolute distances ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 m by use of the first multiple-distance-measurement technique. The second analysis technique has the capability to measure vibration frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 100 Hz with an amplitude as small as a few nanometers without a priori knowledge.",Hai-Jun Yang and Jason Deibel and Sven Nyberg and Keith Riles,74,1367936831648702005,Applied optics,19,3937-3944,Optical Society of America,High-precision absolute distance and vibration measurement with frequency scanned interferometry,https://www.osapublishing.org/abstract.cfm?uri=AO-44-19-3937,44,2005,/scholar?cites=1367936831648702005,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:XiVPGOgt02cC

8656,"The elliptic flow, v 2, of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at forward rapidity (2.5< y< 4) is measured in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The scalar product, two-and four-particle Q cumulants and Lee–Yang zeros methods are used. The dependence of the v 2 of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays on the collision centrality, in the range 0–40%, and on transverse momentum, p T, is studied in the interval 3< p T< 10 GeV/c.

8677,"There has recently been a dramatic renewal of interest in hadron spectroscopy and charm physics. This renaissance has been driven in part by the discovery of a plethora of charmonium-like XYZ states at BESIII and B factories, and the observation of an intriguing proton-antiproton threshold enhancement and the possibly related X (1835) meson state at BESIII, as well as the threshold measurements of charm mesons and charm baryons. We present a detailed survey of the important topics in tau-charm physics and hadron physics that can be further explored at BESIII during the remaining operation period of BEPCII.

The jet energy resolution and a calibration of forward jets are derived using dijet balance measurements. The jet mass response is measured with two methods: using mass peaks formed by W bosons and top quarks with large transverse momenta and by comparing the jet mass measured using the energy deposited in the calorimeter with that using the momenta of charged-particle tracks.

8717,We present a robust scheme to derive effective models non-perturbatively for quantum lattice models when at least one degree of freedom is gapped. A combination of graph theory and the method of continuous unitary transformations (gCUTs) is shown to efficiently capture all zero-temperature fluctuations in a controlled spatial range. The gCUT can be used either for effective quasi-particle descriptions or for effective low-energy descriptions in case of infinitely degenerate subspaces. We illustrate the method for 1d and 2d lattice models yielding convincing results in the thermodynamic limit. We find that the recently discovered spin liquid in the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice lies outside the perturbative strong-coupling regime. Various extensions and perspectives of the gCUT are discussed.,Hong-Yu Yang and Kai P Schmidt,66,13379494207408467900,EPL (Europhysics Letters),1,17004,IOP Publishing,Effective models for gapped phases of strongly correlated quantum lattice models,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/94/17004/meta,94,2011,/scholar?cites=13379494207408467900,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:Q5l_SYa7sicC

The measurement uses the full 2010 data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 39 pb−1. Six possible combinations of light, charm and bottom jets are identified in the dijet events, where the jet flavour is defined by the presence of bottom, charm or solely light flavour hadrons in the jet.

The observed data are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations. Exclusion limits are presented in models of new phenomena including pair production of dark matter candidates or large extra spatial dimensions. In a simplified model of dark matter and an axial-vector mediator, the search excludes mediator masses below 710 GeV for dark matter candidate masses below 150 GeV.

8759,"Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) play a central role in solving the decades-old cooling-flow problem. Although there is consensus that AGNs provide the energy to prevent catastrophically large star formation, one major problem remains: How is the AGN energy thermalized in the intracluster medium (ICM)? We perform a suite of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core cluster including cosmic rays (CRs). CRs are supplied to the ICM via collimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via streaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming instability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient at least within the context of the physical model considered here. When streaming is included,(i) CRs come into contact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it,(ii) streaming instability …",Mateusz Ruszkowski and H-Y Karen Yang and Christopher S Reynolds,60,9391905290914709838,The Astrophysical Journal,1,13,IOP Publishing,Cosmic-ray feedback heating of the intracluster medium,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa79f8/meta,844,2017,/scholar?cites=9391905290914709838,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:xLfsFhML-FoC

However, the role of thermal conduction remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that anisotropic thermal conduction in cluster cool cores (CCs) could drive the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instabilities (HBIs) that reorient the field lines in the azimuthal directions and isolate the cores from conductive heating from the outskirts. However, how the AGN interacts with the HBI is still unknown. To understand these interwined processes, we perform the first 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isolated CC clusters that include anisotropic conduction, radiative cooling, and AGN feedback.

8812,"This paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational waves from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHB). The search was performed on data from the second joint science run of the LIGO and Virgo detectors (July 2009–October 2010) and was sensitive to IMBHBs with a range up to∼ 200 Mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinations of the binaries with respect to the line of sight.

It is demonstrated that, in addition to the lower growth temperature, growth of the AlN interlayer under Al-rich conditions is a critical factor for crack-free GaN growth on Si(1 1 1) substrates. The effect of the AlN interlayer thickness and NH3/TMAl ratios on the lattice constants of subsequently grown high temperature GaN was investigated by X-ray triple crystal diffraction. The results show that the elimination of micro-cracks is related to the reduction of the tensile stress in the GaN epitaxial layers. This was also coincident with a greater number of pits formed in the AlN interlayer grown under Al rich conditions.

8822,"Two-particle angular correlations between unidentified charged trigger and associated particles are measured by the ALICE detector in p–Pb collisions at a nucleon–nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The transverse-momentum range 0.7< p T, assoc< p T, trig< 5.0 GeV/c is examined, to include correlations induced by jets originating from low momentum-transfer scatterings (minijets). The correlations expressed as associated yield per trigger particle are obtained in the pseudorapidity range| η|< 0.9.

8853,"The role of cosmic rays generated by supernovae and young stars has very recently begun to receive significant attention in studies of galaxy formation and evolution due to the realization that cosmic rays can efficiently accelerate galactic winds. Microscopic cosmic-ray transport processes are fundamental for determining the efficiency of cosmic-ray wind driving. Previous studies modeled cosmic-ray transport either via a constant diffusion coefficient or via streaming proportional to the Alfvén speed. However, in predominantly cold, neutral gas, cosmic rays can propagate faster than in the ionized medium, and the effective transport can be substantially larger; ie, cosmic rays can decouple from the gas. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of patches of galactic disks including the effects of cosmic rays.

8866,"Searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) using terrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs of detectors. The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among other things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the separation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a colocated detector pair is more sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a noncolocated detector pair. However, colocated detectors are also expected to suffer from correlated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could contaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and mitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential increase in sensitivity of colocated detectors.

High-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurement reveal that the thickness of AlN buffer exerts a strong influence on the distribution of dislocation and stress in GaN epilayer. The evidence is further reinforced by atomic force microscopic observation of AlN nucleation process. The optimum thickness of AlN buffer to effectively suppress Si diffusion has been determined by secondary-ion mass spectroscopy to be in the range of 13–20 nm.

The nuclear modification factor R A A obtained from these is observed to be independent of p T, within uncertainties, and to be less than unity, which indicates suppressed production of heavy-flavor muons in Pb+ Pb …",Morad Aaboud and Georges Aad and Brad Abbott and B Abeloos and DK Abhayasinghe and SH Abidi and OS AbouZeid and NL Abraham and H Abramowicz and H Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and Shin-ichi Adachi and L Adamczyk and J Adelman and M Adersberger and A Adiguzel and T Adye and AA Affolder and Y Afik and C Agheorghiesei and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and F Ahmadov and G Aielli and S Akatsuka and TPA Åkesson and E Akilli and AV Akimov and GL Alberghi and J Albert and P Albicocco and MJ Alconada Verzini and S Alderweireldt and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and C Alexa and G Alexander and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and B Ali and G Alimonti and J Alison and SP Alkire and C Allaire and BMM Allbrooke and BW Allen and PP Allport and A Aloisio and A Alonso and F Alonso and C Alpigiani and AA Alshehri and MI Alstaty and B Alvarez Gonzalez and D Álvarez Piqueras and MG Alviggi and BT Amadio and Y Amaral Coutinho and L Ambroz and C Amelung and D Amidei and SP Amor Dos Santos and S Amoroso and CS Amrouche and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and JK Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and CR Anelli and S Angelidakis and I Angelozzi and A Angerami and AV Anisenkov and A Annovi and C Antel and MT Anthony and M Antonelli and DJA Antrim and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and G Arabidze and Y Arai and JP Araque and V Araujo Ferraz and R Araujo Pereira and ATH Arce and RE Ardell and FA Arduh and JF Arguin and S Argyropoulos and AJ Armbruster and LJ Armitage and A Armstrong and O Arnaez and H Arnold and M Arratia and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Artz and S Asai and N Asbah and A Ashkenazi and EM Asimakopoulou and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and RJ Atkin and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and K Augsten and G Avolio and R Avramidou and B Axen and MK Ayoub and G Azuelos and AE Baas and MJ Baca and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and P Bagnaia and M Bahmani and H Bahrasemani and AJ Bailey and JT Baines and M Bajic and C Bakalis and OK Baker and PJ Bakker and D Bakshi Gupta and EM Baldin and P Balek and F Balli and WK Balunas and E Banas and A Bandyopadhyay and S Banerjee and AAE Bannoura and L Barak and WM Barbe and EL Barberio and D Barberis and M Barbero,47,2135885092175747794,Physical review C,4,044905,American Physical Society,Measurement of the suppression and azimuthal anisotropy of muons from heavy-flavor decays in Pb+Pb collisions at  TeV with the ATLAS detector,https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.98.044905,98,2018,/scholar?cites=2135885092175747794,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:-EWy74Q-d-YC

8890,"This paper presents results from a wide parameter search for periodic gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars using data from the Virgo detector [1]. The data used in this paper were produced during Virgoʼs first science run (VSR1), which started on 18 May 2007 and ended on 1 October 2007. The VSR1 data have never been searched for periodic gravitational waves from isolated neutron stars before. The innovation of the search is the combination of the efficiency of the FFT algorithm together with a nearly optimal grid of templates. Rotating neutron stars are promising sources of gravitational radiation in the band of ground-based laser interferometric detectors (see [2] for a review). In order for these objects to emit gravitational waves, they must exhibit some asymmetry, which could be due to imperfections of the neutron star crust or the influence of strong internal magnetic fields (see [3] for recent results …",Junaid Aasi and BP Abbott and Rich Abbott and Thomas Abbott and Matthew Robert Abernathy and Timothee Accadia and F Acernese and Kendall Ackley and Carl Adams and Thomas Adams and Paolo Addesso and Rana X Adhikari and Christoph Affeldt and Michail Agathos and Nancy Aggarwal and Odylio D Aguiar and Anirban Ain and Parameswaran Ajith and Almir Alemic and B Allen and A Allocca and Daniel Amariutei and M Andersen and R Anderson and Stuart B Anderson and Warren G Anderson and Koji Arai and Melody C Araya and C Arceneaux and Joseph Areeda and SM Aston and P Astone and Peter Aufmuth and Carsten Aulbert and L Austin and Benjamin Edwin Aylott and Stanislav Babak and Paul T Baker and G Ballardin and Stefan W Ballmer and Juan C Barayoga and Mark Barbet and Barry C Barish and David Barker and Fabrizio Barone and B Barr and Lisa Barsotti and Matteo Barsuglia and Mark A Barton and Imre Bartos and Riccardo Bassiri and A Basti and Jim C Batch and Joran Bauchrowitz and Th S Bauer and Berit Behnke and Michal Bejger and MG Beker and Chris Belczynski and Angus S Bell and C Bell and Gerald Bergmann and Diego Bersanetti and Alessandro Bertolini and J Betzwieser and Peter T Beyersdorf and Igor Antonovich Bilenko and G Billingsley and Jeremy Birch and Sebastien Biscans and Massimiliano Bitossi and Marie-Anne Bizouard and Eric Black and James Kent Blackburn and L Blackburn and David Blair and Steven Bloemen and M Blom and O Bock and Timothy Paul Bodiya and M Boer and Gilles Bogaert and Christina Bogan and Charlotte Bond and François Bondu and L Bonelli and Romain Bonnand and Rolf Bork and Michael Born and K Borkowski and Valerio Boschi and Sukanta Bose and Leone Bosi and Carlo Bradaschia and Patrick R Brady and Vladimir Borisovich Braginsky and Marica Branchesi and James E Brau and T Briant and DO Bridges and Alain Brillet and Marc Brinkmann and Violette Brisson and Aidan F Brooks and Duncan Alexander Brown and Daniel D Brown and F Brückner and Saps Buchman and Tomasz Bulik and Henk Jan Bulten and Alessandra Buonanno and Ron Burman and Damir Buskulic and Christelle Buy and Laura Cadonati and Gianpietro Cagnoli and J Calderón Bustillo and Enrico Calloni and Jordan B Camp and Paul Campsie and Kipp C Cannon and Benjamin Canuel and J Cao and Collin D Capano and Franco Carbognani and Ludovico Carbone and Santiago Caride and Anthony Castiglia and Sarah Caudill and Fabien Cavalier and Roberto Cavalieri and Charles Celerier and Giancarlo Cella and Christian Cepeda and Elisabetta Cesarini and Rijuparna Chakraborty and Tara Chalermsongsak and SJ Chamberlin and Shiuh Chao and Philip Charlton and E Chassande Mottin and Xu Chen and Yanbei Chen and Andrea Chincarini and Antonino Chiummo and Hee Suk Cho and Jong Chow and Nelson Christensen and Qi Chu and SSY Chua,46,12345497458105699170,Classical and quantum gravity,16,165014,IOP Publishing,Implementation of an-statistic all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in virgo vsr1 data,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/31/16/165014/meta,31,2014,/scholar?cites=12345497458105699170,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:hYn2feYqS88C

8932,"We present a measurement of the azimuthal asymmetries of two charged pions in the inclusive process e+ e−→ π π X, based on a data set of 62 pb− 1 at the center-of-mass energy of 3.65 GeV collected with the BESIII detector. These asymmetries can be attributed to the Collins fragmentation function. We observe a nonzero asymmetry, which increases with increasing pion momentum. As our energy scale is close to that of the existing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data, the measured asymmetries are important inputs for the global analysis of extracting the quark transversity distribution inside the nucleon and are valuable to explore the energy evolution of the spin-dependent fragmentation function.",M Ablikim and MN Achasov and XC Ai and O Albayrak and M Albrecht and DJ Ambrose and A Amoroso and FF An and Q An and JZ Bai and R Baldini Ferroli and Y Ban and DW Bennett and JV Bennett and M Bertani and D Bettoni and JM Bian and F Bianchi and E Boger and I Boyko and RA Briere and H Cai and X Cai and O Cakir and A Calcaterra and GF Cao and SA Cetin and JF Chang and G Chen and HS Chen and HY Chen and JC Chen and ML Chen and SJ Chen and X Chen and XR Chen and YB Chen and HP Cheng and XK Chu and G Cibinetto and HL Dai and JP Dai and A Dbeyssi and D Dedovich and ZY Deng and A Denig and I Denysenko and M Destefanis and F De Mori and Y Ding and C Dong and J Dong and LY Dong and MY Dong and SX Du and PF Duan and EE Eren and JZ Fan and J Fang and SS Fang and X Fang and Y Fang and L Fava and F Feldbauer and G Felici and CQ Feng and E Fioravanti and M Fritsch and CD Fu and Q Gao and XY Gao and Y Gao and Z Gao and I Garzia and K Goetzen and WX Gong and W Gradl and M Greco and MH Gu and YT Gu and YH Guan and AQ Guo and LB Guo and Y Guo and YP Guo and Z Haddadi and A Hafner and S Han and XQ Hao and FA Harris and KL He and XQ He and T Held and YK Heng and ZL Hou and C Hu and HM Hu and JF Hu and T Hu and Y Hu and GM Huang and GS Huang and JS Huang and XT Huang and Y Huang and T Hussain and Q Ji and QP Ji and XB Ji and XL Ji and LW Jiang and XS Jiang and XY Jiang and JB Jiao and Z Jiao and DP Jin and S Jin and Tord Johansson and A Julin and N Kalantar-Nayestanaki and XL Kang and XS Kang and M Kavatsyuk and BC Ke and P Kiese and R Kliemt and B Kloss and OB Kolcu and B Kopf and M Kornicer and W Kühn and Andrzej Kupsc and JS Lange and M Lara and P Larin and C Leng and Cheng Li and Cheng Li and DM Li and F Li and FY Li and G Li and HB Li and JC Li and Jin Li and K Li and Lei Li and PR Li and T Li and WD Li,42,17926810974375085404,Physical review letters,4,042001,American Physical Society,Measurement of Azimuthal Asymmetries in Inclusive Charged Dipion Production in  Annihilations at ,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.042001,116,2016,/scholar?cites=17926810974375085404,7Q8Zk38AAAAJ:u9uQOfS8_D4C

8934,"This Letter describes the observation of the light-by-light scattering process, γ γ→ γ γ, in Pb+ Pb collisions at s NN= 5.02 TeV. The analysis is conducted using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.73 nb− 1, collected in November 2018 by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Light-by-light scattering candidates are selected in events with two photons produced exclusively, each with transverse energy E T γ> 3 GeV and pseudorapidity| η γ|< 2.4, diphoton invariant mass above 6 GeV, and small diphoton transverse momentum and acoplanarity. After applying all selection criteria, 59 candidate events are observed for a background expectation of 12±3 events. The observed excess of events over the expected background has a significance of 8.2 standard deviations.
