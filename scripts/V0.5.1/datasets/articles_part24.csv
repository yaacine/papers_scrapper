24001,"The authors describe a constructionist theory that accounts for the knowledge-based inferences that are constructed when readers comprehend narrative text. Readers potentially generate a rich variety of inferences when they construct a referential situation model of what the text is about. The proposed constructionist theory specifies that some, but not all, of this information is constructed under most conditions of comprehension. The distinctive assumptions of the constructionist theory embrace a principle of search (or effort) after meaning. According to this principle, readers attempt to construct a meaning representation that addresses the reader's goals, that is coherent at both local and global levels, and that explains why actions, events, and states are mentioned in the text. This study reviews empirical evidence that addresses this theory and contrasts it with alternative theoretical frameworks.",Arthur Graesser and Tom Singer and Murray and & Trabasso,4105,6366778108975805390,"Psychological Review,",,371-395,APA,Constructing inferences during narrative text comprehension,https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.101.3.371,101,1994,/scholar?cites=6366778108975805390,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:UarirCmVI0EC
24002,"Advances in computational linguistics and discourse processing have made it possible to automate many language- and text-processing mechanisms. We have developed a computer tool called Coh-Metrix, which analyzes texts on over 200 measures of cohesion, language, and readability. Its modules use lexicons, part-of-speech classifiers, syntactic parsers, templates, corpora, latent semantic analysis, and other components that are widely used in computational linguistics. After the user enters an English text, Coh-Metrix returns measures requested by the user. In addition, a facility allows the user to store the results of these analyses in data files (such as Text, Excel, and SPSS).

However, the cognitive mechanisms that participate in prose comprehension are far from obvious. Even simple stories involve com plexities that have stymied many cognitive scientists. Why is prose comprehen sion so difficult to study? Perhaps because comprehension is guided by so many domains of knowledge. Perhaps because some critical mysteries of prose comprehension reside between the lines-in the mind of the comprehender. Ten years ago very few psychologists were willing to dig beyond the surface of explicit code in their studies of discourse processing. Tacit knowledge, world knowledge, inferences, and expectations were slippery notions that experimental psychologists managed to circumvent rather than understand.

24009,"This volume presents the most current perspectives on the role of metacognition in diverse educationally relevant domains. The purpose is to examine the ways in which theoretical investigations of metacognition have recently produced a strong focus on educational practice. The book is organized around four general themes relevant to education: metacognition and problem solving, metacognition and verbal comprehension, metacognition and the education of nontraditional populations, and metacognition and studentship. Chapter authors review current literature as it applies to their chapter topic; discuss theoretical implications and suggestions for future research; and provide educational applications. Each chapter describes testable theory and provides examples of how theory can be applied to the classroom. The volume will have wide appeal to researchers and students concerned with the scientific investigation of metacognition, and to practitioners concerned with the cultivation of learning and achievement in their students. The unique contribution of this book to the literature on metacognition is its presentation of the most current research examining specific theoretical aspects of metacognition in domains directly relevant to education. This is especially valuable for the many researchers and practitioners who subscribe to the concept that by fostering metacognitive processes during instruction, more durable and transferable learning can be achieved.",Douglas J Hacker and John Dunlosky and Arthur C Graesser,738,1918521188477022720,,,,Routledge,Metacognition in educational theory and practice,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EzWRAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=info:ALI7Ldv0nxoJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lxzg3yCw6A&sig=7ZipYYynslPe7FUtCeubmtI2P7U,,1998,/scholar?cites=1918521188477022720,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C

24028,"Perhaps we should start with some questions. What do you need to learn to understand the title of this chapter? What does “processing coherence relations” mean? Why should a teacher, let alone a student, care about coherence? We care about coherence because we believe, based on years of research, that processing coherence relations is a cornerstone of comprehension. Coherence breaks down when there are gaps in the text and the reader has trouble handling them. The text is less coherent when there are many conceptual and structural gaps in the text, and the reader does not possess the knowledge to fill them. At the other end of the continuum, the text is progressively more coherent to the extent that there are few gaps and the reader has the prerequisite knowledge. This chapter identifies the specific cues or characteristics of text that fortify coherence.Our research, and research from many others, has pointed to various properties of the text as one important mission for improving readers’ comprehension. The recent RAND report on Reading for Understanding (Snow, 2002) has communicated the pressing need to improve reading comprehension in schools throughout the country. Students’ ability to understand the complex material expressed in textbooks is indeed suffering. For teachers, this pressing need for change may have seemed evident for many years, and certainly didn’t require an official report. However, the report also documents a remarkable evolution in our understanding of reading comprehension. It is now quite evident that a critical aspect of reading is the comprehension meaning.

The think-aloud protocols were used to predict sentence reading times for other participants who read silently with the same strategies. The results indicated that readers are capable of strategically controlling the inferences that they generate.

24039,"Reading comprehension is one of the most complex and uniquely human of cognitive activities. During reading, the successful comprehender connects the various events, persons, and objects that he or she encounters so that the text appears to be a coherent whole rather than a random list of facts and events. Frequently, the relations between parts of a text are implicit and, therefore, must be inferred. If all goes well, the result of inferential processing is a mental representation of the text that is relatively stable and that can be accessed at a later point in time to answer questions, retell the story, and so forth. A considerable amount of research has been devoted to the online inferential processes that are involved in the establishment of relations between text elements. In addition, properties of the memory representation of texts have enjoyed the attention of investigators in psychology, education, and even anthropology for years. Much less is known, however, about the relation between the online processes and the memory representation. On the one hand, the reader’s goal of building a coherent memory representation mayinfluence which of various types of inferences he or she will generate. On the other hand, the inferences that are generated during reading somehow must lead to the representation of the text in memory.In this chapter, we propose a theoretical model of reading comprehension that describes both the inferential processes that take place during reading and the way in which these processes form the basis for a stable memory repre sentation of the text.

These frameworks offer different claims and commitments with respect to computational architectures and the status of strategies in comprehension. It is recommended that researchers identify the predictions of these and other theoretical frameworks when planning their empirical research on the effectiveness of reading strategies in educational settings. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some challenges that researchers will face when moving from theory to interventions and to assessments of reading comprehension strategies.Reading is an extraordinary achievement when one considers the number of levels and components that must be mastered. Consider what it takes to read a simple story. The words contain graphemes, phonemes, and morphemes. Sentences have syntactic composition, propositions, and stylistic features.

24047,We present AutoTutor and Affective AutoTutor as examples of innovative 21st century interactive intelligent systems that promote learning and engagement. AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system that helps students compose explanations of difficult concepts in Newtonian physics and enhances computer literacy and critical thinking by interacting with them in natural language with adaptive dialog moves similar to those of human tutors. AutoTutor constructs a cognitive model of students' knowledge levels by analyzing the text of their typed or spoken responses to its questions.

24048,"What is text understanding? It is the dynamic process of constructing coherent representations and inferences at multiple levels of text and context, within the bottleneck of a limited-capacity working memory. The field of text and discourse has advanced to the point where researchers have developed sophisticated models of comprehension, and identified the particular assumptions that underlie comprehension mechanisms in precise analytical or mathematical detail. The models offer a priori predictions about thought and behavior, not merely ad hoc descriptions of data. Indeed, the field has evolved to a mature science. The contributors to this volume collectively cover the major models of comprehension in the field of text and discourse. Other books are either narrow--covering only a single theoretical framework--or do not focus on systematic modeling efforts. In addition, this book focuses on deep levels of understanding rather than language codes, syntax, and other shallower levels of text analysis. As such, it provides readers with up-to-date information on current psychological models specified in quantitative or analytical detail.",Bruce K Britton and Arthur C Graesser,286,11028134136124331835,,,,Psychology Press,Models of understanding text,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lZsNtOY2DvcC&oi=fnd&pg=PP9&dq=info:O9cMN5HNC5kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=5KuJEBWlYc&sig=gHJ731wwcZiKlUpOolB5vYcENjE,,1996,/scholar?cites=11028134136124331835,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:kNdYIx-mwKoC

24055,"Whenever Bert learns about a new topic, he is an active, inquisitive, creative, intellectual"" sponge."" He energetically asks dozens of questions, impatiently waits for answers, and is not satisfied until he receives a good answer. When Homer learns about a new topic, however, his style is completely different. He is a passive recipient of knowledge. He assumes that the social and physical world is sufficiently kind to supply him with useful, relevant information. He never imposes himself on anyone with a question. Researchers and teachers have often discussed the virtues of being an inquisitive learner who actively exerts control over the material to be learned by asking questions. Unfortunately, educational researchers have consistently observed that most learners are like Homer rather than Bert. Student-generated questions are infrequent and unsophisticated (Dillon, 1987, 1988; Flammer, 1981; Kerry, 1987). Student-generated questions constitute approximately 1% of the questions in a classroom, at an average rate of one question per hour. The questions are normally simple questions that involve the recall and interpretation of explicit material rather than higher-level questions that involve inferences, application, synthesis, and evaluation. When teachers attempt to increase the frequency of student-generated questions by positive reinforcement, the outcome has been discouraging because there is only an increase in shallow questions (Neber, 1976). A learner needs to master a significant amount of the material before the learner begins to formulate good questions (Miyake & Norman, 1979).",Arthur C Graesser and Natalie Person and John Huber,238,1713084938310603495,Questions and information systems,,167-187,,Mechanisms that generate questions,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EsE73E1mBz4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA167&dq=info:51IT0qwZxhcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=i1ZsoOpIKv&sig=WCBzPH5vR1_HI7LUl2TKShTQ6bE,2,1992,/scholar?cites=1713084938310603495,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:qxL8FJ1GzNcC

24062,"I have proposed previously that language comprehension can be described as structure building, and I have sketched a simple framework to use as a guide. I call this framework the Structure Building Framework. According to the Structure Building Framework, the goal of comprehension is to build cohesive mental representations, or structures. The first process involved in building a structure is laying a foundation. The next process involves developing the structure by mapping on incoming information when that information coheres with the previous information. However, if the incoming information is less coherent, comprehenders employ a different process: They shift to initiate a new substructure. Thus, most representations comprise several branching substructures. The building blocks of mental structures are memory nodes. Memory nodes are activated by incoming stimuli. Their initial activation forms the foundation of mental structures. Incoming information often is mapped onto a developing structure because the more coherent the incoming information is with the previous information, the more likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. However, the less coherent the incoming information, the less likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. If the incoming information is less coherent, it activates different nodes, and the activation of these different nodes forms the foundation for a new substructure. lThis chapter is reprinted from chapter 6 of Language Comprehension as Structure Building (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1990).",Morton Ann Gernsbacher,192,10689716040935656746,Models of understanding text,,289-311,"Mahwah, Lawrence Erlbaum, Nueva Jersey","The structure-building framework: What it is, what it might also be, and why",http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_wrsAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA289&dq=info:Ks3DSRqAWZQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=b7OTpIS9Xm&sig=pogHlEXDb3Et_cbnQfnMDJzjR1g,,1996,/scholar?cites=10689716040935656746,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:mgoTDWlsYNUC

It is widely acknowledged that the comprehension of science and technological artifacts is very difficult for both children and adults. The material is conceptually complex, there is very little background knowledge for most individuals, and the materials are often poorly written. Therefore, it is no surprise that students are turned off from learning science and technology. Given these challenges, it is important to design scientific text in a fashion that fits the cognitive constraints of the learner. The enterprise of textbook design needs to be effectively integrated with research in discourse processing, educational technology, and cognitive science. This book takes a major step in promoting such an integration.

Training and validation data on affective states were collected in a learning session with AutoTutor, after which the learners' affective states (i.e., emotions) were rated by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges. An automated body pressure measurement system was used to capture the pressure exerted by the learner on the seat and back of a chair during the tutoring session. We extracted two sets of features from the pressure maps.

This intuition is shared by virtually everyone in linguistics (including psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and text linguistics) and in cognitive science (discourse psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy of mind, social cognition, cognitive anthropology). However, there has been considerable controversy over matters of inference generation. What inferences are generated? When are they generated? What sources of information need to be intact when inferences are generated? What cognitive processes and representations produce inferences during comprehension? And what, precisely, is an inference anyway? Twenty years ago there was very little scientific knowledge about inferences in text comprehension. Most research efforts concentrated on the representation of explicit text and the process of linking anaphoric expressions (eg, nounphrases, pronouns) to previous explicit text constituents. Times have changed in the world of discourse psychology. There have been serious efforts by discourse psychologists to dig deeper and understand how readers construct'situation models', ie, mental models of what the text is about. For example, the situation model for a story would consist of a microworld with characters who perform actions in pursuit of goals, events that present obstacles to goals, conflicts between characters, emotional reactions, the spatial setting, the style and procedure of actions, objects, properties of objects, traits of characters, and mental states of characters.

We are no longer restricted to areas like mathematics and science where interaction with the student can be limited to typing in numbers or selecting possibilities with a button. Others have tried to implement tutors that interact via natural language in the past, but because of the difficulty of understanding language in a wide domain, their best results came when they limited student answers to single words.

The success of this technique has been described elsewhere [3, 5, for example]. In this paper, we give an overview of LSA and how it is used in our tutoring system.

24089,"Serious games are designed with the explicit goal of helping students learn about important subject matter, problem solving strategies, and cognitive or social skills. Instead of learning about biology by reading a textbook, listening to a lecture, or interacting with a conventional computer-based training system, the learner plays a game that successfully integrates the game with curriculum. If we could manage to design serious games, the impact would be revolutionary because the learning of difficult content would end up being an enjoyable, engaging experience for the learner. Intellectual hard work would be transformed into play.Unfortunately, at this point in the learning sciences, very few serious games have been developed that would impress experts in education.

The current study further investigates the importance of text cohesion and other signatures of text difﬁculty by examining the characteristics of a corpus of texts that vary in grade level and text genre. The results show that referential cohesion increases across grade levels. However, while lower-grade texts have lower referential cohesion, they have higher verb cohesion. This suggests that the smaller overlap in objects is compensated by larger overlap in actions. The results collectively point to a tradeoff between difﬁculty at the lexical and cohesion levels. Such a result suggests that it is insufﬁcient to deﬁne text difﬁculty simply on the basis of word frequency, word length, and sentence length. Text difﬁculty is also a result of cohesion.There are many issues to consider when developing measures to assess text comprehension. Most traditional reading comprehension assessments comprise brief passages that cover a relatively wide range of topics (eg, Nelson-Denny, Gates MacGinitie tests). This breadth of coverage is assumedly intended to reduce the effects of prior knowledge on performance.

The surface code preserves the exact wording and syntax of clauses. In most cases, comprehenders retain the surface code of only the most recent clause being processed. The textbase contains the explicit text propositions in a stripped-down form that preserves meaning, but not the exact wording and syntax of text. The textbase also includes a small number of inferences that are needed to establish text coherence. Finally, there is the referential situation model of what the text is about. A situation model is a mental representation of the people, setting, actions, and events that are explicitly mentioned or inferentially suggested by the text (Albrecht & O’Brien, 1993; Bower, 1989; Glenberg, Meyer, & Lindem, 1987; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Morrow, Bower, & Greenspan, 1987; Singer, 1990). Situation models may vary in abstractness from bare-bone conceptual sketches to lifelike renditions of episodes in the real world. Most inferences generated during text comprehension are part of the constructed situation model.At this point in the science, researchers know far more about the construction of the surface code and the textbase than they know about the construction of the situation model.

Although we know that as children get older they gradually develop more metacognitive knowledge (Schneider & Pressley, 1989), we know little about how this knowledge is acquired. We know little as well about the relationships between developing higher level thinking skills and emerging domain-specific cognitive structures.

24113,"Since the early 1980s, there has been a considerable amount of theoretical conjecture and empirical research regarding the construction of situation models during the comprehension of narrative texts. This interest in situation models was largely influenced by the seminal book by van Dijk and Kintsch (1983). van Dijk and Kintsch argued that readers not only construct a representation for the gist of the explicit text, but also a representation for the situation described in the text. An underlying assumption of van Dijk and Kintsch’s thesis is that there is a verisimilitude between the real world and the story world. Readers presumably use their general knowledge of the real world to construct a mental model of the events depicted in the narrative world. As an example of this verisimilitude, narrative events are understood as being causally linked within a narrative time and space, much like the manner in which we understand events in the real world. Thus, the situation model provides an index of narrative events along a number of dimensions, such as characters and objects, temporality, spatiality, causality, and intentionality (Magliano, Trabasso, & Langston, 1995; Zwaan, Langston, & Graesser, 1995; Zwaan, Magliano, & Graesser, 1995).

While the original AutoTutor is sensitive to learners’ cognitive states, the affect-sensitive tutor is responsive to their affective states as well. This affective tutor automatically detects learners’ boredom, confusion, and frustration by monitoring conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features. The sensed affective states guide the tutor’s responses in a manner that helps students regulate their negative emotions. The tutor also synthesizes affect via the verbal content of its responses and the facial expressions and speech of an embodied pedagogical agent.

Dozens of measures funnel into five major factors that systematically vary as a function of types of texts (e.g., narrative vs. informational) and grade level: narrativity, syntactic simplicity, word concreteness, referential cohesion, and deep (causal) cohesion. Texts are automatically scaled on these five factors with Coh-Metrix-TEA (Text Easability Assessor). This article reviews how these five factors account for text variations and reports analyses that augment Coh-Metrix in two ways.

24121,"Contemporary models of text comprehension are not well equipped to account for the comprehension of literary texts. This is partly due to the persistent tendency of text comprehension researchers to focus on experimenter-generated text rather than on naturalistic text (Graesser, Haberlandt, & Magliano, 1994; van Oostendorp & Zwaan, 1994; Zwaan & van Oostendorp, 1993). However, literary texts prose specific problems for the comprehender that are not captured in experimenter-generated prose. For example, many literary texts are unique in the sense that they are deliberately constructed to be inconsiderate. In this chapter, I propose a model of literary comprehension that takes the “inconsiderateness” of literary discourse into account. The proposed model is essentially an extension of existing models of text comprehension that were developed by Kintsch and van Dijk (Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978; Kintsch, 1988; van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983).My main assumption in this chapter is that readers develop cognitive control systems for specific types of discourse. These control systems are developed through repeated exposures to different types of text and through explicit instruction. Experienced readers develop a literary control system by reading literature and by their training in high school and college. The literary control system monitors the comprehension of inconsiderate literary texts. This control system may be triggered by the novelty of a book, the reader’s goal, or an instruction to read a literary text.",Rolf A Zwaan,113,15240815599646523463,Models of understanding text,,241-255,Lawrence Erlbaum,Toward a model of literary comprehension,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=_wrsAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA241&dq=info:R8Ap4AlBgtMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=b7OTpISaXn&sig=n2VSEtp191ShESIJYZjVFKRpG-U,,1996,/scholar?cites=15240815599646523463,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:yD5IFk8b50cC

This paper discusses four computer learning environments that either naturally or artificially induce confusion in learners in order to create learning opportunities.

Although female agents with male voices formed an exception, this was explained by a stereotype effect.

24127,"This chapter presents new models of comprehension that we have been developing in recent years. These models focus on deeper levels of comprehension (which involve pragmatics, inferences, and world knowledge) rather than shallow levels of comprehension (such as lexical processing, syntactic parsing, and the interpre tation of explicit text). Early research in the psychology of language and discourse processing emphasized the shallow levels of comprehension. It was easier to measure and manipulate factors directly associated with the surface text than to struggle with barely visible mechanisms at the deep levels. There were many theories about the surface levels, enough theories to occupy everyone’s time for several decades. However, researchers came to recognize the pressing need to explore the deep levels. They discovered that the deep levels often have a greater impact on reading time, memory, decision making, and judgment than do the shallow levels. They also identified interesting ways in which deep levels interacted with shallow levels of processing. The Zeitgeist has shifted from the shallow to the deep levels of comprehension.The research reported in this chapter investigates three rather diverse components of deep comprehension: dialogue patterns, generation of knowledgebased inferences, and question asking. Each of these components has interested researchers in discourse processing and natural language comprehension, but adequate psychological theories have not yet evolved.

Reported effect sizes have ranged from 0.4 to 2.3 standard deviation units when tutored students are compared to classroom instruction or other control groups (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995; Bloom, 1984; Cohen, Kulik, & Kulik, 1982; Mohan, 1972). These effect sizes are quite surprising considering that a normal tutor typically has minimal tutoring experience, lacks expert domain knowledge, and has received no training in sophisticated tutoring techniques (Fitz-Gibbon, 1977; Graesser & Person, 1994). Although the majority of studies that report the benefits of tutoring primarily focused on outcomes, some of the more contemporary research is aimed at understanding the tutoring process (Fox, 1991, 1993; Graesser, Bowers, Hacker, & Person, in press; Graesser & Person, 1994; Graesser, Person, & Magliano, 1995; Lepper, Aspinwall, Mumme, & Chabay, 1990; Merrill, Reiser, Ranney, & Trafton, 1992; Person, Graesser, Magliano, & Kreuz, 1994; Putnam, 1987).

24135,"The ubiquity of hypermedia learning environments poses several challenges for researchers and educators. Learning with these non-linear, mutli-representational, open-ended learning environments typically involves the use of numerous metacognitive and self-regulatory processes such as planning, knowledge activation, metacognitive monitoring and regulation, and reflection (Azevedo, 2008, 2009; Greene & Azevedo, 2009; Moos & Azevedo, 2008; Schraw, 2007; Veenman, 2007; Winne & Hadwin, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008). Unfortunately, learners do not always regulate these processes when learning with hypermedia. As such, learners’ failure to regulate limits the instructional effectiveness of these environments to enhance learning about complex and challenging topics. In this chapter we will describe how we have used hypermedia environments to assess learners’ self-regulated learning (SRL). More specifically, we have used empirical data and associated theoretical SRL frameworks to design MetaTutor. MetaTutor is a hypermedia-based multi-agent learning environment that was designed to model, trace, and foster learners’ SRL in the context of learning about several human biological systems. The goal was to build an intelligent learning environment capable of fostering learners’ SRL during learning in laboratory and classroom contexts.This chapter is structured into the following sections:(a) an overview of SRL with hypermedia;(b) a theoretical overview that treats SRL as an event, with dynamically unfolding processes that are deployed during learning;(c) a brief review of research on SRL as an event with hypermedia;(d) a …",Roger Azevedo and Amy Johnson and Amber Chauncey and Arthur Graesser and B Zimmerman and D Schunk,99,6064998676677275956,Handbook of self-regulation of learning and performance,,102-121,"Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group New York, NY, US",Use of hypermedia to assess and convey self-regulated learning,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=XfOYV0lwzGgC&oi=fnd&pg=PA102&dq=info:NDGQpik0K1QJ:scholar.google.com&ots=4LxmIkqMaH&sig=0kyUvdAoQBvQEhXu3xo1Guy_Wu8,32,2011,/scholar?cites=6064998676677275956,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:VL0QpB8kHFEC
24136,"This chapter reviews research on human tutoring and also some technologies that enhance the tutoring experience. The previous chapter on tutoring in this Handbook series (Graesser, D’Mello, & Cade 2011) identified a number of tutoring strategies that human tutors routinely enact, as well as some ideal strategies they could use if they had the capacity to implement them. Some instructional strategies are so complex to apply that it takes an intelligent computer tutoring system to track what the student knows and to adaptively help the student by generating well-selected tutoring moves. Indeed, there is a growing field of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that has shown promise and is continuing its momentum in scaling up to accommodate millions of learners over the developmental life-span (Graesser, Conley, & Olney, 2012; Sottilare, Graesser, Hu, & Goldberg, 2014; Woolf, 2009). Moreover, both human tutors and computer tutors have shown impressive learning gains compared to classroom teaching and other comparison conditions, as we will document in this chapter. The focus of this chapter is on the instructional strategies and mechanisms that underlie tutoring, whether the tutor is another human or a computer. Tutoring is a form of one-on-one instruction between a tutor (human or computer) and a tutee (student). The human tutors vary in experience and expertise. Peer tutors are involved when one student is assigned the role of tutor and the other the tutee (Johnson & Johnson, 1992; Mathes & Fuchs, 1994; Slavin, 1990; Topping, 1996).

The feedback is based on composition research which describes the process of writing as one of simultaneously solving multiple, possibly conflicting, constraints. In Select-a-Kibitzer, each constraint is personified by a different character. A student enters a composition into the tool and then asks for feedback. A variety of natural language processing techniques are used to analyze the text. Then, each of the characters gives feedback on the text from its particular point of view. Select-a-Kibitzer differs greatly from standard “style checker” mechanisms that focus on surface features of the text.

Such amodel would capture the cognitive representations that are constructed during comprehension, and as a result of comprehension. It would specify the processing mechanisms that participate in the construction of these representations. The output of the model would match behavioral indices of online representations and processes, such as think-aloud protocols, reading times, and naming latencies for test words interspersed in the text. The output of the model would also match behavioral indices of the final representation that are achieved after comprehension is complete, such as recall, summarization, question answering, and ratings of the relatedness of text constituents. An ideal model would be applicable to different classes of texts, readers with different cognitive styles, and readers with different reading goals. It would be grounded in major theories of cognition.

24151,"Comprehension monitoring has been conceptualized in several ways. One line of inquiry is based on what Winograd and Johnston (1982) called the “error detection paradigm”(p. 61). It was started in the late 1970s by Ellen Markman’s (1977, 1979) research on children’s awareness of inconsisten cies. Subjects are provided with inconsistent information, typically textual contradictions or information that contradicts subjects’ knowledge, and comprehension monitoring is assessed by subjects’ ability to identify and react to these inconsistencies. Work on calibration of comprehension, which started in the 1980s, represents another kind of research on comprehension monitoring. It consists in measuring the relation between readers’ predic tions of understanding text and their actual performance as measured by questions on main points of the text (Glenberg & Epstein, 1985, 1987). Related to this work is research on predictions of memory for text or metamemory and predictions of comprehension or metacomprehension (Maki & Berry, 1984; Maki &Swett, 1987).Two components have been distinguished in comprehension monitoring: evaluation and regulation of comprehension (Baker, 1985; Otero, 1996; Zabrucky & Ratner, 1986, 1989, 1992). Evaluation refers to the identifica tion of a comprehension problem; regulation refers to the remedial strategies used to solve these problems, for example inferencing or rereading portions of a text. The difference is illustrated in studies using the error detection paradigm.",José Otero,91,15160587314354288459,Metacognition in educational theory and practice,,145-164,,Influence of knowledge activation and context on comprehension monitoring of science texts,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EzWRAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA145&dq=info:S3dhktY5ZdIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=lxzg3yCybA&sig=tGq71NQxxMzuyONqHNJCy8RiUGw,,1998,/scholar?cites=15160587314354288459,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:iWL_APfBKHwC

24153,"When a reader comprehends a story, the reader constructs a mental microworld. The microworld includes the core plot that sustains the interest of the reader: the characters who perform actions in pursuit of goals, events that present obstacles to goals, conflicts between characters, clever methods of resolving conflicts, and emotional reactions to events and conflicts. The mental microworld sometimes includes elaborations that flesh out the plot and add color: the spatial setting, the style and procedure of actions, props, objects, properties of objects, and traits of agents. The microworld might also have content that refers to the mental states of the characters (ie, what they believe, know, see, want, and feel) and the pragmatic agents who tell the story (ie, the imaginary narrator and the camera operator). Discourse psychologists have used the term situation model when they refer to this mental microworld that is constructed by the comprehender of a story (Graesser, Millis, & Zwaan, 1997; Kintsch, 1998). Discourse psychologists are in harmony about some general beliefs about the construction of situation models for stories. They uniformly agree that the explicit text does not sufficiently constrain and determine what information goes into the situation model. Instead, much of the information is actively constructed by tapping world knowledge and by inferentially filling in gaps in the explicit text (Bower, Black, & Turner, 1979; Graesser, Millis, et al., 1997; Kintsch, 1998; Trabasso & Magliano, 1996; van den Broek, 1994).

The present book represents a sliver, albeit a substantial one, of the scholarship on the science of learning and its application in educational settings (Science of Instruction, Mayer 2011).

24162,"A satisfactory model of executive control processes during reading must account for inference generation. Unfortunately, however, cognitive psychologists do not have a ﬁne-grained understanding of inference generation, compared to their understanding of processing components that are directly linked to explicit text. This chapter reports some data and aspires to clarify two important questions regarding the relationship between inference generation and executive control processes. First, how do variations in executive control processes inﬂuence the generation of knowledge-based inferences during reading? Second, what is the impact of inference generation and world knowledge on reading time? There are several alternative ways that executive control processes may inﬂuence inference generation. Perhaps variations in the readers’ goals and conscious reading strategies determine what inferences are generated and how much processing resources are allocated to different categories of inferences. If this is the case, then researchers need to identify different categories of inferences and to explain how variations in executive control processes systematically map onto the cognitive resources allocated to the different categories. Alternatively, perhaps exec-utive control processes merely determine the overall amount of cognitive resources allocated to inference generation, without any selective allocation to speciﬁc inference categories.

However, despite this interest in learning at scale, there has been limited work investigating the impact MOOCs can play on student learning. In this study, we adopt a novel approach, using language and discourse as a tool to explore its association with two established measures related to learning: traditional academic performance and social centrality. We demonstrate how characteristics of language diagnostically reveal the performance and social position of learners as they interact in a MOOC. We use Coh-Metrix, a theoretically grounded, computational linguistic modeling tool, to explore students’ forum postings across five potent discourse dimensions. Using a Social Network Analysis (SNA) methodology, we determine learners’ social centrality. Linear mixed-effect modeling is used for all other analyses to control for individual learner and text characteristics. The results indicate that learners performed significantly better when they engaged in more expository style discourse, with surface and deep level cohesive integration, abstract language, and simple syntactic structures. However, measures of social centrality revealed a different picture. Learners garnered a more significant and central position in their social network when they engaged with more narrative style discourse with less overlap between words and ideas, simpler syntactic structures and abstract words.

Our results indicated that the affective state of flow was manifested through heightened pressure exerted on the seat of a pressure sensitive chair.

24176,"It is important to have a chapter in this volume on one-to-one tutoring because it is one of the most effective methods of helping students learn. Tutoring provides the opportunity for an intense “meeting of the minds” between a student and a person with subject matter expertise. Tutoring is the standard panacea when students are failing to meet expected grades and anxiety reverberates among the students, parents, teachers, principals, and school systems. Anxiety turns to panic when a school is not meeting the standards of a high stakes test, when a prize athlete may be cut from a team, and when a student runs the risk of losing a scholarship. A wealthy family might end up paying $200 per hour for an accomplished tutor to save a son or daughter. It is very easy to justify the use of tutors from the standpoint of learning gains. Meta-analyses show learning gains from typical, non-expert human tutors of approximately 0.4 sigma (effect size in standard deviation units) compared to classroom controls and other suitable controls (Cohen, Kulik, & Kulik, 1982). Non-expert tutors are paraprofessionals, cross-aged tutors (ie, students who are older than the tutee), or same-age peers who have had little or no tutor training and have modest subject-matter expertise. Collaborative peer tutoring shows an effect size advantage of 0.2 to 0.9 sigma (Johnson & Johnson, 1992; Mathes & Fuchs, 1994; Slavin, 1990; Topping, 1996), and appears to be slightly lower than older non-expert human tutors (Pilkington & Parker-Jones, 1996).

Examples of paradigms in social cognition include the formation of person impressions, the attribution of causes of social behavior, and conversational interaction. Example paradigms in the ﬁeld of artificial intelligence include knowledge representation, natural language comprehension, pattern recognition, and robotics. There are advantages to working within a paradigm. Researchers accumulate a rich set of data that are collected with established methodologies.

24185,"This chapter examines inference generation during the comprehension of expository text. There are many subtypes of expository texts that span across many topic domains. The chapter focuses on passages that describe mechanisms found in nature or technology. To understand passages, the reader must access knowledge about concepts that are explicitly mentioned in the passage and must generate at least some knowledge-based inferences. The cognitive system stores world knowledge in the form of both generic knowledge structures (GKS) and specific knowledge structures. Nodes in the network are constructed on the bases of the explicit text, the GKS's, and specific knowledge structures. Three broad classes of knowledge-based inferences are associated with scientific mechanisms. They are states, future events, and past/concurrent events.

The question of whether it is possible to create a computer program that possesses human intelligence has spurred much debate. Turing (1950) argued that computers are not capable of thinking and provided several theological, psychological, and sociological arguments in support of his position. To determine a computer program’s intelligence, Turing proposed several benchmark methods. One such method requires humans to decide whether they are interacting with an actual computer program or another human via computer mediation.

24190,"Text understanding involves more than the construction and retrieval of a mental representation of the explicit text. Rather, understanding is achieved when readers are able to activate and apply their text-appropriate world knowledge in order to generate inferences regarding what the text is about. Furthermore, readers use their world knowledge in order to infer how elements of a text are related, and thus ensure that their mental representation of the text is coherent. Although there is consensus among discourse-processing researchers regarding the importance of world knowledge in understanding and achieving text coherence, there has been considerable theoretical conjecture and empirical research regarding what kinds of knowledge-based inferences readers normally generate during comprehension (Graesser, Singer, & Trabasso, 1994; Magliano & Graesser, 1991; McKoon & Ratcliff, 1992). Much of this debate has centered around (a) what inferences are necessary for achieving text coherence,(b) the extent to which readers generate inferences that are not necessary for achieving coherence, and more recently (c) what processes are involved in making inferences available to a reader. Although there has been much progress, the debates regarding these issues are far from resolved. There has also been disagreement among researchers regarding the appropriate methodology for studying inference processes during reading (Keenan, Golding, Potts, Jennings, & Aman, 1990; Magliano & Graesser, 1991; Potts, Keenan, & Golding, 1988).

24209,"There is a vision that advanced learning technologies can optimize the delicate balance between emotions and the learning of academic material. Students are not prone to have much fun when they are expected to learn a dense array of new jargon, complex systems with many components, mental models with tradeoffs between variables, solutions to difficult problems, and other difficult academic content. The technology needs to be designed in some fashion that allows students to have emotionally satisfying experiences as they attempt to master material that is often viewed as tedious, pedantic, exceedingly challenging, or useless in their eyes. In an ideal world, the computer system would put the student in a zone of optimal concentration that targets relevant knowledge about the subject matter at a pace that delivers the right challenges to the particular student at the right time. A serious game could be engineered that brilliantly manages the tradeoff between fun and work. However, one would need to be very clever in designing such a serious game because young learners are skeptical of games that have any semblance of academic content. The game designer would need to smuggle in the academic subject matter under the students’ attitudinal radar.The goal of this chapter is to describe some advanced learning technologies that consider student emotions in addition to the conventional focus on cognition.

New-argument nouns had a greater impact at clause boundaries than at nonboundary locations. In accordance with a buffer-integrate-purge model of reading (see Jarvella, 1979), the increase of reading times at boundaries was attributed to the integration of new information from the current sentence with prior information in the text representation.

24214,OperationARIES!(or ARIES for short) is an intelligent tutoring system that teaches critical thinking and helps learners acquire scientific inquiry skills. One of the core components of ARIES is “trialogs” which are three-party conversations in natural language among a human student and two artificial pedagogical agents (tutor and fellow student). These tutorial interactions were designed to enhance the students’ learning experience. Assessing student input is essential to the performance of ARIES. Regular expressions and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) were used in models that evaluate students’ answers. The resulting computational models were found to be as reliable as human raters.,Zhiqiang Cai and AC Graesser and Carol Forsyth and Candice Burkett and Keith Millis and Patricia Wallace and Diane Halpern and Heather Butler,58,10556947151672238094,Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE international conference on intelligent computing and intelligent systems,,429-433,IEEE Press,Trialog in ARIES: User input assessment in an intelligent tutoring system,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carol_Forsyth/publication/266143070_Trialog_in_ARIES_User_Input_Assessment_in_an_Intelligent_Tutoring_System/links/54277a440cf238c6ea7ac426/Trialog-in-ARIES-User-Input-Assessment-in-an-Intelligent-Tutoring-System.pdf,,2011,/scholar?cites=10556947151672238094,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:FAceZFleit8C

24230,"Since the 1998 publication of our first edited volume, Metacognition in Educational Theory and Practice, metacognition has continued to be an important area of research, and its applications to education have continued to grow. The topics covered in our earlier volume included problem solving, reading, writing, self-regulation, technology, and metacomprehension.

We now include chapters on comprehension strategies, metacognitive strategies, mathematics and science, individual differences, self-regulated learning, technology, tutoring, and measurement. A common theme running throughout all these chapters is the notion of agency: successful students take charge of their own learning. At a minimum, taking charge requires students to be aware of their learning, to evaluate their learning needs, to generate strategies to meet their needs, and to implement those strategies. Self-awareness, selfdetermination, and self-direction are the characteristics that Kluwe (1982) used when he described people as “agents of their own thinking”(p. 222). As agents of our own thinking, we construct our understanding of ourselves and the world, we control our thoughts and behaviors, and we monitor the consequences of them. The sense of agency in metacognition puts the focus of attention clearly on the individual person. But who is this person? With the rise of cognitive science from behaviorism in the 1960s, the intent was to focus on the person as a thinking agent as opposed to an organism mechanically reacting to stimuli.

24232,"Most of this chapter is concerned with the issue of whether answering questions increases memory of materials that children are asked to learn. It may be surprising to readers of a volume devoted entirely to the psychological effects of questions that there are few programmatic efforts on strategic questioning in the child development literature. On a more optimistic note, recent data and theory, including research programs in progress at the time of this writing, suggest tantalizing possibilities. Unfortunately, research that has occurred has usually been conducted at single-age levels, an approach that precludes developmental conclusions. The question types tested and the issues addressed often have been derived in a straightforward fashion from the adult literature rather than from cognitive-developmental theoretical positions. Typical research questions are of the following type:‘‘Question type X works in context A with adults. Will it do so with children?” Even when results obtained with children have been different from those obtained with adults, the designs of the studies usually have not permitted evaluation of why the child data differed from the adult data or whether the data patterns produced by children might be obtained in some learning situations but not others.

24234,"Literary reading has been a topic of inquiry among scholars of literature and educationalists for nearly three quarters of a century (Richards, 1929; Rosenblatt, 1937). Among empirical researchers, in contrast, attention to literature is quite recent, with most studies having been carried out only over the last 20 years. The literary field is fraught with controversy, however. Basic differences over the object of study militate against the emergence of a single paradigm for empirical research. Disagreement over the nature of literature centers on whether literature is a fundamental category of discourse with distinctive properties or a cultural formation produced during the last 200 or 300 years (eg, Terry, 1997) and sustained by specific conventions (possibly facing extinction in the face of new electronic media).

Two positions were contrasted: the buffer-integrate-purge position, which assumes that text-level interpretive and inference processes operate at sentence or clause boundaries, and the immediacy position, which assumes that interpretive and inference processes operate as soon as possible. Two methods of collecting word reading times were contrasted: gaze durations and self-paced word reading times. In simple narrative passages, there was an increase in word reading times for end-of-clause words when self-paced reading times were collected, but there was a decrease when gaze durations were measured with eye tracking equipment.

24237,"AutoTutor is a complex cognitive system that simulates a human tutor, or an ideal tutor, by holding a conversation with the learner in natural language. AutoTutor qualifies as a cognitive system in two fundamental ways (see Forsythe & Xavier, chap. 1, this volume). First, its core architecture incorporates a humanlike model of knowledge, discourse, and cognitive processes. Second, AutoTutor recruits these psychological mechanisms to engage the learner cognitively and thereby promote learning. Therefore, AutoTutor both simulates cognitive mechanisms of human tutors and facilitates cognitive activities of human learners. AutoTutor was developed by Graesser and colleagues in the interdisciplinary Institute for Intelligent Systems at the University of Memphis (Graesser et al., 2004; Graesser, Person, Harter, & Tutoring Research Group, 2001; Graesser, VanLehn, Rose, Jordan, & Harter, 2001; Graesser, K. Wiemer-Hastings, P. Wiemer-Hastings, Kreuz, & Tutoring Research Group, 1999). AutoTutor presents a series of challenging questions or problems that require approximately a paragraph (3–7 sentences) of information to answer correctly. An example question in conceptual physics is,“When a car without headrests on the seats is struck from behind, the passengers often suffer neck injuries. Why do passengers get neck injuries in this situation?” Although a perfect answer to this question is approximately 3 to 7 sentences in length, the initial answers by actual human learners are typically only 1 word to 2 sentences in length.

Speech acts are important in dialogue-based educational systems because they help infer the student speaker’s intentions (the task of speech act classification) which in turn is crucial to providing adequate feedback and scaffolding. A key step in the speech act classification task is defining the speech act categories in an underlying speech act taxonomy. Most research to date has relied on taxonomies which are guided by experts’ intuitions, which we refer to as an extrinsic design of the speech act taxonomies. A pure data-driven approach would discover the natural groupings of dialogue utterances and therefore reveal the intrinsic speech act categories. To this end, this paper presents a fully-automated data-driven method to discover speech act taxonomies based on utterance clustering.

This is followed by an overview of the major findings of a recent meta-analysis aimed at identifying a subset of learning-centered affective states that generalize across students, learning technologies, learning tasks, and experimental methodologies. We then turn our attention to the two major types of AALTs: reactive systems that respond to affect once it occurs and proactive systems that aim to induce or impede certain affective states. Affective AutoTutor, GazeTutor, and UNC-ITSpoke are presented as examples of reactive AALTs, while Crystal Island and ConfusionTutor are included as examples of proactive AALTs.

When the text is in the narrative genre, such as a simple story, the situation model is a mental mi-croworld of events and actions, with characters performing actions in the pursuit of goals, events that present obstacles to the goals, conﬂicts between char-acters, methods of resolving conﬂicts, and emotional reactions to the events and conﬂicts. If the reader has sufficient time and motivation, the mental mi-croworld can have quite vivid elaborations that ﬂesh out details of the spatial setting, the style and procedure of actions, and the properties of objects that characters use. There may also be content that refers to mental states of char-acters (what they believe, know, perceive, and want). Mental models are cre-ated from information in the text as well as knowledge of the reader. It is comparatively easy for adults to construct situation models for narra-tive texts because the microworlds have a close correspondence to everyday experiences. In contrast, it is more difficult to construct a situation model for informational texts, such as an expository text on a scientific mechanism. Ideally, the reader would be able to construct a mental model of the components, causal chains, and processes that capture a scientific mechanism. However, this is very difficult or impossible when the reader has little world knowl-edge to furnish the content needed to construct the mental model.

Cognitive disequilibrium occurs when there are obstacles to goals, interruptions of organized action sequences, impasses, system breakdowns, contradictions, anomalous events, dissonance, incongruities, negative feedback, uncertainty, and deviations from norms, and novelty. Cognitive disequilibrium launches a trajectory of cognitive and affective processes such as confusion and frustration until equilibrium is restored or disequilibrium is dampened via effortful problem solving and impasse resolution.

The selection of texts is indeed one of the central concerns of teachers, principals, and superintendents as they plan for meeting the standards declared by No Child Left Behind and Race to the Top. Advances in psycholinguistics, discourse processes, and cognitive science provide a theoretical foundation for scaling texts on multiple levels. To this end, a principal components analysis was conducted on Coh-Metrix indices for 37,520 texts representative of what typical senior in high school might encounter kindergarten through 12th grade. The results indicated that eight components accounted for 67.3% of the variance, with five main components associated with text ease, referred to as Coh-Metrix Easability Components. These five components closely align with the theoretical levels text and discourse comprehension, including narrativity, syntactic simplicity, word concreteness, referential cohesion, and deep cohesion.

It starts with mapping the Text and Hypothesis on to graph structures that have nodes representing concepts and edges representing lexico-syntactic relations among concepts. An entailment decision is then made on the basis of a subsumption score between the Text-graph and Hypothesis-graph. The results obtained from a standard entailment test data set were promising.

It should not be surprising to find, therefore, that the organization of this knowledge from long-term memory has a great influence on the outcome of our experiences. The importance of this a priori organization, or the ability to organize thoughts as they are encountered, has been well documented in the text comprehension literature. In a classic study, Bransford and Johnson (1972) demonstrated that providing a thematic title to participants prior to reading an ambiguous passage has dramatic effects on later recall. In their study, those who read the titles recalled approximately twice as much as those who read the ambiguous passage without the benefit of its title. This highlighted the power of a schema to activate relevant knowledge prior to the reading of a text and thereby produce better comprehension of that text.Anderson and Pichert (1978) showed how prior knowledge can influence what readers choose to recall about a text. Texts were presented which had two different interpretations. In one text, the main character could be a prisoner or a wrestler, whereas in the second text, an event could be interpreted as a card game or a music concert. Anderson and Pichert showed the paragraphs to groups of wrestlers and music students, and found that their subsequent recall was based on the interpretation they chose while reading the passage.

We analyzed the knowledge states, properties of questions, strategies, and interaction patterns of students and tutors. Students did attempt to self-regulate their knowledge by identifying knowledge deficits and asking questions that repair such deficits, but they need substantial training in improving question asking skills. Students answers to deep questions eg, why, why-not, how, what-if were poor in quality, so the tutor helped answer these questions in a collaborative process that took several conversational turns.

The residents were randomly assigned to view sexually explicit films charged in an obscenity case, violent materials, or control materials. The results showed that residents believe the sexually explicit films charged in the case did not appeal to a self-reported shameful, morbid, or unhealthy (prurient) interest in sex, and are not patently offensive. Community members indicated they would be substantially less accepting of the sexually explicit materials if they contained rape and bondage, and they showed virtually no acceptance of materials including children actors under the age of 18.

There are systems with animated conversational agents, intelligent adaptive tutoring, interactive simulations, and other features designed to engage learners and promote deeper comprehension. One system is AutoTutor, a learning environment that tutors students by holding a conversation in natural language. AutoTutor’s design was inspired by explanation-based constructivist theories of learning, intelligent tutoring systems that adaptively respond to student knowledge, and empirical research on dialogue patterns in tutorial discourse. AutoTutor presents challenging questions and then engages in mixed initiative dialogue that guides the student in building an answer. It provides feedback to the student on what the student types in (positive, neutral, negative feedback), pumps the student for more information, prompts the student to fill in missing words, gives hints, fills in missing information, identifies andTechnology-Based Education: Bringing Researchers and Practitioners Together, pages 143–167",Arthur C Graesser and Natalie Person and Zhijun Lu and Moon Gee Jeon and Bethany McDaniel,36,18278138646744820932,Technologybased education: Bringing researchers and practitioners together,,143-167,,Learning while holding a conversation with a computer,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nf0nDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA143&dq=info:xGyQ6kH-qP0J:scholar.google.com&ots=Va-JcUDbc4&sig=o7QSn-Q89YZE_TrYmtLSZ3Os8gs,,2005,/scholar?cites=18278138646744820932,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:LjlpjdlvIbIC

24294,"Our approach to the study of theme is distinctly psychological and computational. Our ultimate goal is to investigate psychological theories that explain how humans comprehend text. Quite clearly, theme is a very important level of analysis in these theories. If a reader fails to mentally construct a theme that satisfies various constraints in the explicit text, then the reader has somehow failed to build a cognitive representation that is globally coherent. Simply put, the reader has lost sight of the forest for the trees. There obviously are other levels of analysis that are important to comprehension, but the construction of an appropriate theme is a good litmus test of successful comprehension (Graesser, Golding, and Long, 1991; Graesser, Singer, and Trabasso, 1994; Williams, 1993). Theme questions are quite common in the psychometric tests of comprehension that are taken by millions of students in the United States each year. The most popular test is the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) developed by Educational Testing Service. The student first reads a text and then selects which of 5 test options is the best theme for the text. One of the options is regarded as the best theme among the set of alternatives. Interestingly, students are rarely explicitly taught how to extract themes from texts in the school system, but they are frequently evaluated on their ability to perform this complex cognitive skill.

24295,"When a literary narrative is comprehended, such as a novel or a short story, the readers ideally construct multiple agents in their cognitive representations. Each agent is a human entity that is normally capable of speaking, perceiving, believing, knowing, wanting, acting, and experiencing emotions. One ensemble of agents consists of the characters in the story. Character agents are very salient in the text and in the minds of the readers as they construct their mental story worlds. The protagonists, antagonists, and other main characters are more salient than the minor characters and those characters that are functionally props. A second ensemble of agents consists of the narrator, narratee, writer, and imaginary reader. These agents will be called “pragmatic” agents because they address the communicative exchange between the narrator and narratee, or between the writer and reader. Pragmatic agents are frequently invisible to the reader, particularly those readers who have not received formal training on how to read literature. What are the virtues in viewing literary stories as linguistic products of multiple agents?

24303,"Questions arise as a natural part of the learning process in classrooms, tutoring, computer-based training, and other learning environments. Students may request an explanation, a clarification, or a concrete example, or they may make some other form of inquiry that signals uncertainty. Student questions are learner centric because they reflect the learner's lack of specific knowledge or inability to comprehend. The role of student questions is particularly important in computer-based distributed learning, where instruction is available any time, anywhere, for anyone. There needs to be a mechanism for students to get a timely response to a spontaneous question. An underlying concern, therefore, is the impact of question-asking on learning. How does the process of question-asking and interpreting answers influence learning, performance, and student satisfaction? There is ample evidence that the rate of student question-asking in the classroom is extremely low compared with other learning environments, such as one-onone tutoring (Graesser, McNamara, & VanLehn, 2005; Graesser & Person, 1994).

24307,"Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computerized learning environments that incorporate computational models from the cognitive sciences, learning sciences, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, mathematics, and other fields. An ITS tracks the psychological states of learners in fine detail, a process called student modelling. The psychological states may include subject matter knowledge, skills, strategies, motivation, emotions, and other student attributes. An ITS adaptively responds with activities that are both sensitive to these states and that advance its instructional agenda. The interaction between student and computer evolves in a flexible fashion that caters to the constraints of both the student and the instructional agenda. This is a marked departure from a book or a lecture, which unfold in a rigid linear order and are not tailored to individual students.The history of ITS was christened with the edited book by Sleeman and Brown (1982) entitled Intelligent Tutoring Systems. The contributors to the book were an interdisciplinary mixture of researchers in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and education. There was the vision that learning could substantially improve by developing adaptive learning environments that took advantage of the latest advances in intelligent systems. Some of these ITS attempted to model characteristics of human tutoring whereas others adopted ideal, rational models of intelligent systems.

AutoTutor is an animated pedagogical agent that holds a conversation in natural language, with spoken contributions by the learner. Thirty students completed a multiple-choice pre-test, a 35-minute training session, and a multiple-choice post-test. After completing the post-test, the students reviewed the tutorial interaction and were stopped at strategically sampled points for emotion judgments. At these points they judged what emotions they experienced on the basis of the dialogue history and their facial expressions. The emotions they judged were boredom, flow (engagement), frustration, confusion, delight, surprise, and neutral. A multiple regression analysis revealed that post-test scores were significantly predicted by pre-test scores and confusion, but not by any of the other emotions. The results support a theoretical framework that emphasizes the role of cognitive disequilibrium (perplexity) in promoting learning at deeper levels.

24329,"This chapter describes methods of analyzing the structures, functions, and representations of text. The lens is on the text, but we will selectively identify salient implications for cognitive processes and educational practice. The primary emphasis is also on automated methods of text analysis. That is, a computer system receives the text, performs processes that implement computational algorithms, and produces a text analysis on various levels of language and discourse structure. However, sometimes there are theoretical components of text that cannot be handled by computers so it is necessary to have human experts annotate or structure the text systematically. Human annotation schemes are identified in cases when it is beyond the scope of computer technologies to perform such text processing mechanisms. A systematic analysis of the text is no doubt important to any comprehensive theory of reading and any application designed to improve reading in school systems. Reports on reading comprehension research acknowledged that there is a complex interaction among characteristics of the reader, the tasks that the reader is to perform, the socio-cultural context, and the properties text itself (National Reading Panel, 2000; McNamara, 2007; Snow, 2002). Investigations of such interactions are facilitated by precise measures of the properties of the text at various levels of analysis: words, sentences, paragraphs, entire texts. Readers may excel at some levels, but have deficits at others, so it is necessary to measure and record the various levels.

The approach takes into account the full lexico—syntactic context of both the Text and Hy—pothesis and relies heavily on the concept of subsumption. It starts with mapping the Text and Hypothesis into graph—structures where nodes represent concepts and edges represent lexicO—syntactic rela—tions among concepts. Based on a subsumption score between the Text—graph and Hypothesis—graph an entailment decision is made. A novel feature Of our approach is the handling Of negation.

AutoTutor takes the learner’s typed verbal contributions, speech, and actions as input and accommodates events in different media to trigger or change paths of conversations. It also sends commands to the learning system for execution, such as presenting pictures and launching scenarios (Cai, Feng, Baer & Graesser, 2014).There are many steps in composing an AutoTutor conversation with one or more computer agents and a human learner.

These domains are ideal for ITS’s, because they cazl bc easily represented and because the type of interaction between the student and the tutor can be limited to entering a few simple numbers, symbols, or ke)~’ords. Students need help in other areas, but without the ability to robustly understand a student’s input, ITS’s in these areas are inherently limited.

Algebra and geometry tutors have been the basis for two years’ high school math curriculum (Anderson et al. 1995). College students have learned physics from an ITS (VanLehn et al. 1998). Another system helped military personnel learn to troubleshoot faults in electronic equipment (Lesgold et al. 1992).

24349,"We hypothesize that cognitively engaged readers dynamically adjust their reading times with respect to text complexity (ie, reading times should increase for difficult sections and decrease for easier ones) and failure to do so should impair comprehension. This hypothesis is consistent with theories of text comprehension but has surprisingly been untested. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing 4 datasets in which participants (N= 484) read expository texts using a self-paced reading paradigm. Participants self-reported mind wandering in response to pseudorandom thought-probes during reading and completed comprehension assessments after reading. We computed two measures of cognitive coupling by regressing each participant’s paragraph-level reading times on two measures of text complexity: Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level and Word Concreteness scores.

24350,"We present a machine learning model that uses particular attributes of individual questions asked by teachers and students to predict two properties of classroom discourse that have previously been linked to improved student achievement. These properties, uptake and authenticity, have previously been studied by using trained observers to live-code classroom instruction. As a first-step in automating the coding of classroom discourse, we model question properties based on the features of individual questions, without any information about the context or domain. We then compare the machine-coded results to two referents: human-coded individual questions and “gold standard” codes from existing data. The performance achieved by the models is as good as human experts on the comparable task of coding individual questions out of context. Yet ultimately, this study highlights the need to draw on contextualizing information in order to most completely identify question properties associated with individual questions.",Borhan Samei and Andrew M Olney and Sean Kelly and Martin Nystrand and Sidney D'Mello and Nathan Blanchard and Xiaoyi Sun and Marcy Glaus and Art Graesser,24,13706398002399047949,Grantee Submission,,,,Domain Independent Assessment of Dialogic Properties of Classroom Discourse.,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED566380,,2014,/scholar?cites=13706398002399047949,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:S2WlVNSe3u4C
24351,"In this study, we compared Entailer, a computational tool that evaluates the degree to which one text is entailed by another, to a variety of other text relatedness metrics (LSA, lemma overlap, and MED). Our corpus was a subset of 100 self-explanations of sentences from a recent experiment on interactions between students and iSTART, an Intelligent Tutoring System that helps students to apply metacognitive strategies to enhance deep comprehension. The sentence pairs were hand coded by experts in discourse processing across four categories of text relatedness: entailment, implicature, elaboration, and paraphrase. A series of regression analyses revealed that Entailer was the best measure for approximating these hand coded values. The Entailer could explain approximately 50% of the variance for entailment, 38% of the variance for elaboration, and 23% of the variance for paraphrase. LSA contributed marginally to the entailment model. Neither lemma-overlap nor MED contributed to any of the models, although a modified version of MED did correlate significantly with both the entailment and paraphrase hand coded evaluations.

The construction of a conceptual graph structure includes three major steps, which are summarized as: segment information into statement nodes, assign each statement node to a node category and interrelate nodes by labeled, directed arcs.

The assessment framework defined by the PISA ColPS 2015 expert group crossed three major collaboration processes with four problem solving processes that were adopted from the PISA 2012 individual problem solving assessment to form a matrix of 12 specific skills. The three major collaboration processes are (1) establishing and maintaining shared understanding;(2) taking appropriate action; and (3) establishing and maintaining team organization. The four problem solving processes are exploring and understanding the problem, representing and formulating the problem, planning and executing strategies, and monitoring and reflecting on the problem-solving activities. This article discusses how the problem-solving dimension was integrated with the collaboration dimension. We also discuss how computer agents were involved in the PISA ColPS 2015 assessment in order to ensure a satisfactory assessment of collaborative problem solving.

Roles have distinct patterns of behavioral engagement (i.e., active or passive, leading or following), contribution characteristics (i.e., providing new information or echoing given material), and social orientation (i.e., individual or group). Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals.

It locates this phenomenon in current conceptions of learning and teaching, far removed from traditional ideas of one-way transmission of knowledge. Exactly what happens to promote learning by teaching is explored. Examples of learning by teaching are discussed and it is noted that this happens in school, university and the workplace, as well as through the Internet. Learning by teaching within the student body is then explored, and many different methods described. The organizational features needed to improve learning by teaching consciously and deliberately are investigated. These can be before teaching, during teaching or after teaching. Evidence-based practical guidance is given. Of course teachers can deploy learning by teaching for themselves, but what if they also organize their students to teach each other, thereby giving many more opportunities to discuss, practise, explain and question?

24365,"Twenty-five years ago my colleagues and I (the first author of this chapter) were in an intense debate over what inferences are generated during text comprehension. It was a lively debate. At the one end there was the minimalist position that predicted the only inferences that were encoded were those that were activated quickly by associations in longterm memory and those that were triggered by obstacles in text cohesion that forced more deliberate thought (McKoon and Ratcliff, 1992). At the other end was the promiscuous position, typically by researchers outside of psychology (ranging from literature to computer science) that postulated that a very large and unconstrained set of inferences were generated by virtue of background knowledge and experiences. My research team advocated an intermediate constructionist position (Graesser, Singer, and Trabasso, 1994; Singer, Graesser, and Trabasso, 1994) that attempted to predict what subset of inferences are generated on the basis of what we know about social, discourse, and cognitive mechanisms. These mechanisms stretched beyond the memory-based models of the minimalist position and into concerns of the goals and emotions of people and the explanations of events that occur in our everyday worlds. A book edited by Graesser and Bower (1990) articulated the various theoretical positions, methods to study inference generation, and of course empirical data.A flurry of models and empirical findings evolved in the 1990s in an effort to pin down what inferences were generated under what conditions.

Although intelligent tutoring systems have been around for several decades (Carbonell, 1970; Sleeman & Brown, 1982; & Wenger, 1987), pedagogical agents did not appear until about ten years ago (Chan & Baskin, 1990). Pedagogical agents have been designed to produce a range of behaviors that include the ability to reason about multiple agents in simulated environments (Eliot & Woolf, 1996), act as a peer, co-learner, or competitor (Chan, 1996; Dillenbourg, Jermann, Schneider, Traum, & Buiu, 1997; Frasson et al., 1996), generate multiple …",Nathalie K Person and Arthur C Graesser,22,6700007253213759411,"Encyclopedia of Education, Macmillan, New York",,1169-1172,,Pedagogical agents and tutors,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6700007253213759411&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2006,/scholar?cites=6700007253213759411,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:eAUscmXIlQ8C

The current research examines which features of the dialog can account for the learning gains, and assesses AutoTutor's appropriate use of dialog. Specifically, we explored the dialog patterns from natural tutoring interactions with AutoTutor and analyzed how short pedagogical feedback is related to learning.

The fact that integration is necessary for giving the text cohesion is a familiar notion in the study of rhetoric and in composition manuals. Some investigators pointed out that inferences are often necessary for accomplishing textual integration. New information in a sentence must be connected to a unique antecedent in the representation. Integration of new information is a delayed process taking place at specific locations rather than continuously with each new-argument noun. There are characteristic differences between readers in terms of integration processes. Slower readers tend to integrate at linguistic junctions, whereas fast readers rely on both physical layout and linguistic junctions.

A web-based instructional tutor is a practical solution for comprehension instruction, because many adults have busy schedules or transportation problems and because many literacy teachers have limited knowledge of comprehension training (National Research Council (NRC), 2011). CSAL AutoTutor is an intelligent tutoring system on the web that delivers comprehension instruction. The system includes two computer agents that hold a conversation with the human and with each other (called trialogues, Graesser, Li, & Forsyth, 2014a; McNamara, O’Reilly, Best, & Ozuru, 2006) and thereby guide the human in learning comprehension skills and using the computer facility. The CSAL AutoTutor curriculum has 35 lessons with trialogues that focus on specific comprehension strategies. The AutoTutor lessons each take 10 to 50 minutes to complete and are assigned by teachers on the research team (in adult literacy centers) in a hybrid intervention with both teachers and computer facilities. The strategies are aligned with a PACES intervention (see below), which teachers have successfully implemented (face-to-face) to improve reading comprehension in high school students with reading difficulties (Lovett, Lacerenza, De Palma, & Frijters, 2012).

A fundamental goal of this serious game is to engage students during learning through natural language tutorial conversations. A tight integration of cognition, discourse, motivation, and affect is desired to meet this goal. Forty-six undergraduate students from two separate colleges in Southern California interacted with Operation ARIES! while intermittently answering survey questions that tap specific affective and metacognitive states related to the game-like and instructional qualities of Operation ARIES!. After performing a series of data mining explorations, we discovered two trends in the log files of cognitive-discourse events that predicted self-reported affective states. Students reporting positive affect tended to be more verbose during tutorial dialogues with the artificial agents.

24400,"Discourse comprehension is a very rich, multilevel cognitive activity. Consider what it takes to read a simple news story. The words contain letters, pronunciation patterns, meanings, and sometimes emotional nuances. Sentences have syntactic composition, semantic ideas, and stylistic features. Deep comprehension requires the construction of referents of nouns, a discourse focus, presuppositions, and plausible inferences. The reader needs to distinguish old (given) versus new information in the discourse and to acknowledge implicitly what is shared knowledge among individuals in the discourse community (called the common ground). At more global levels, the reader needs to identify the category of the discourse (eg, objective reports versus editorials), the rhetorical structure, perspectives of different people, and sometimes the attitude of the writer. The processing of all of these levels is effortlessly achieved at a rate of 150 to 400 words per minute by a proficient adult reader. It is simply astonishing that we can understand anything that we read given the many levels of language and discourse that must be mastered. The various levels of oral conversation and printed text have been identified by discourse researchers over the years. Discourse researchers in the cognitive tradition typically include five levels (Graesser, Millis, and Zwaan, 1997; van Dijk, 2008; van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983):1) Surface code The words and syntax that are expressed verbatim. 2) Textbase The semantic representation of the explicit text in a stripped down form that removes surface details with few if any semantic consequences.

ELIZA simulated a client-centered Rogerian psychotherapist that attempts to get the clients to talk about their problems and self-discover possible solutions. ELIZA syntactically converted the users’ statements into questions and comments to encourage the users to express themselves. ELIZA had minimal linguistic and semantic resources, but rather relied on recognizing a finite class of keywords and a modest set of production rules to maintain the conversation.

24433,"Imagine that on some unlucky weekday morning your coffee machine breaks down. For many of us, notably the authors of this chapter, this would be a serious problem. One way of solving this urgent problem is by physically fumbling with the broken machine, trying to ﬁx it by using problem-solving heuristics or sheer trial and error. As an alternative, text would come to the rescue. You could read the manual that came with the machine. You could look in a book on household repairs. You could also consult the Internet. When you pursue any of these latter options, you must be able to comprehend the text and apply what you have learned. This chapter explores the factors that predict your success in solving problems such as the broken coffee machine after reading a text. Whenever texts are successfully used to solve a problem, the solver must accurately represent both the problem and the messages presented in the texts. A text representation is a cognitive representation that has some reference to elements, features, or structural patterns in the explicit text. Many factors contribute to the construction of text representations. To put it simply, two classes of factors are properties of the text (such as its organization into topics, subtopics, and sentences) and properties of the reader (such as domain-speciﬁc knowledge and general reading skill). One of the central assumptions of this chapter is that text representations constrain problem solving.

24435,"In the late 1960s an organization theory of memory was advanced by George Mandler (1967, 1972) and a group of other researchers studying memory and cognition ('Ihlving & Donaldson, 1972). The theory included at least three major assumptions. The ﬁrst assumption is that knowledge in long-term memory is organized in the form of a hierarchical structure of concept nodes. For example, consider the hierarchical structure that underlies the animal kingdom. The most superordinate node (animal) directly dominates a handful of nodes at a second level (reptile, bird, ﬁsh, amphibian, mammal), whereas any given node at the second level (eg, mammal) dominates a set of nodes at a third level (dog, cat, monkey, etc.), and so on.A second assumption proposed by Mandler (1967) is that there is a limit to the storage capacity or number of units associated with any given node. Speciﬁcally, approximately ﬁve units are directly subordinate to any given concept node in a hierarchy. We refer to this as the limited fanout assumption.

24442,Coh-Metrix is a web-based application currently in development that automatically evaluates text. It uses two central concepts from discourse processing: text-based cohesion and situation-model based coherence. Cohesion is the degree to which components of the text are linked. Coherence is the representation of the world that the text conveys. Our intention is for Coh-Metrix to eventually map the cohesion of a text to the background knowledge and reading skills of the reader. Coh-Metrix will then be able to give feedback to a writer about which aspects of the text are cohesive and which lack cohesion. This will enable the writer to determine which aspects of the text need to be improved.

24443,"Most models of text comprehension assume that readers create a multilevel representation of texts. These text representations in memory are coherent wholes in normal and successful reading. Nonetheless, because texts are processed sequentially, text comprehension requires the integration of inн formation across sentences to create a coherent representation of the entire text. This creates a problem of explaining how the information that is active in short-term memory (STM) from the current sentence is related to the representation of the prior text. This representation should be accessible so that the presently processed information can be tied to the previously read text and thereby create local and global coherence. Models differ on the analysis of this coherence-building process. There are local coherence models, also called minimalist or linear models by van den Broek and Lorch (1993). Examples of local coherence models are those of Kintsch (1988) and McKoon and Ratcliff (1992).

24444,"One of the enduring problems in American education is fostering the development of children’s literacy skills. Many children of otherwise normal intelligence and academic ability come to the formal schooling environment with weak and underdeveloped skills in comprehending discourse (National Assessment of Educational Progress, 1995). This often places these children at risk for subsequent school failure (Juel, 1992; Slavin, 1994). Thus, a significant challenge for educators is how to design learning environments that support the development of literacy skills for all students, especially those whose initial skills place them at risk. Responding to such a challenge requires detailed knowledge of the development of children’s capabilities for representing simple and complex forms of discourse, coupled with ways to adequately assess those capabilities.

24446,"Many of us have had the vision of learners acquiring STEM subject matters by being immersed in motivating learning environments (such as games) that advance learners to new levels of mastery. Concepts in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are complex and difficult, and require learning at deeper levels than merely memorizing facts, rules, and procedures. Learners would ideally be challenged and motivated to improve on mastering complex topics that might not be acquired with traditional training methods. They would spend hundreds of hours in a hunt for a solution to a problem that few have solved, for the sweet spot in a trade-off between two or more factors, or for a resolution to a set of incompatible constraints. This is precisely the vision of progress for training in the 21st century. How can deep learning be achieved in a motivating learning environment? Games provide a good first place to look for answers because well-designed games are motivating and some meta-analyses have reported positive impacts of games on learning (Mayer, 2011; O’Neil & Perez, 2008; Ritterfeld, Cody, & Vorderer, 2009; Shute & Ventura, 2013; Tobias & Fletcher, 2011; Wouters, van Nimwegen, van Oostendorp, & van der Spek, 2013). This chapter explores the prospects of integrating games with intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). The hope is that there can be learning environments that optimize both motivation through games and deep learning through ITS technologies.

24458,"Background: Pedagogical agents are computerized talking heads or embodied animated avatars that help students learn by performing actions and holding conversations with the students in natural language. Dialogues occur between a tutor agent and the student in the case of AutoTutor and other intelligent tutoring systems with natural language conversation. The agents are adaptive to the students' actions, verbal contributions, and in some systems their emotions (such as boredom, confusion, and frustration). Focus of Study: This paper explores several designs of trialogues (two agents interacting with a human student) that have been have been productively implemented for particular students, subject matters, and depths of learning. The two agents take on different roles, but often serve as peers and tutors. There are different trialogue designs that address different pedagogical goals for different classes of students. For example, students can (a) observe vicariously two agents interacting,(b) converse with a tutor agent while a peer agent periodically chimes in, or (c) teach a peer agent while a tutor rescues a problematic interaction. In addition, agents can argue with each other over issues and ask what the human student thinks about the argument. Research Design: Trialogues have been developed for systematic experimental investigations in several studies that measure student impressions, learning gains from pre-test to post-test on objective tests, and both cognitive and affective states during learning.

24468,"Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is one of the important 21st century skills that has attracted interest in international assessments, national assessments of middle and high school students, colleges, business, and the military (Griffin & Care, 2015; Hesse, Care, Buder, Sassenberg & Griffin, 2015; NRC, 2011; OECD, 2013; Sottilare et al., 2015). CPS is an essential skill in the home, the workforce, and the community because much of the planning, problem solving, and decision making in the modern world is performed by teams. The success of a team can be threatened by a social loafer, an uncooperative unskilled member, or a counterproductive alliance, whereas it can be facilitated by a strong team member that draws out different perspectives, helps negotiate conflicts, assigns roles, promotes team communication, and guides the team to overcome troublesome obstacles (Fiore, Wiltshire, Oglesby, O’Keefe & Salas, 2014; Salas, Cooke & Rosen, 2008).CPS differs from individual problem solving (IPS) in ways that may have both positive and negative consequences. CPS allegedly has advantages over IPS because 1) there is a more effective division of labor, 2) the solutions incorporate information from multiple sources of knowledge, perspectives, and experiences, and 3) the quality of solutions is stimulated by ideas of other team members.

24470,"Education leaders have called for a significant expansion in the use of computer games and simulations, intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), and other virtual learning environments in both formal and informal learning contexts (Graesser, 2013; Honey & Hilton, 2011; Sottilare, Graesser, Hu & Holden, 2013). To accomplish this will require that curriculum developers be able to author and customize such technologies for integration into specific curricula, adaptation to local needs, and alignment with changing standards (Clark, Nelson, Sengupta & D’Angelo, 2009; Honey & Hilton, 2011; Mitrovic et al., 2009). Research on the development of ITSs has shown that anywhere from 100 to 1000 hours of authoring time are needed to produce just 1 hour of instruction (Koedinger & Mitrovic, 2009). The substantial time commitment and expertise required place significant limitations on the creation of sophisticated virtual learning environments.“Our holy grail,” Vincent Aleven and colleagues have suggested, is “to create cost-effective tools that non-programmers can use to create and deliver sophisticated tutors for real-world use”(Vincent Aleven et al., 2009).Prior studies on authorware development suggest that building such tools is both ambitious and potentially transformative (Koedinger, Aleven, Heffernan, McLaren & Hockenberry, 2004; Murray, Blessing & Ainsworth, 2003; Murray, 1999).

It appears that the best strategy for grading essays is to use student derived ideal answers and statistical models that accommodate inferences.

24475,"We have been developing learning environments with animated conversational agents. The agents manage a mixed-initiative dialog between the learner and the computer system either by a direct conversational interaction or by serving as a navigational guide on a web site. Two of the systems simulate human tutors by (a) presenting difficult questions that require deep reasoning,(b) attempting to comprehend the learner’s typed input,(c) formulating dialog acts that are sensitive to the learner’s contributions, and (d) speaking to the student with the animated agent. AutoTutor teaches computer literacy whereas Why/AutoTutor teaches conceptual physics (Graesser, VanLehn, Rose, Jordan, & Harter, 2001).

24476,"When a reader is lost in a book, the wheels of comprehension move on many levels. Most of the wheels need to be in working order and the wheels must mesh in harmony. Damage to a single wheel can spoil the entire experience. This chapter focuses on three wheels that need to mesh when adults comprehend literary short stories: plot, agents, and emotions. The plot consists of a structured configuration of events, actions, goals, plans, and conflicts among protagonists. The agents include the story characters and the pragmatic agents (that is narrator, narratee, reader, writer). Each of these agents has a point of view that witnesses some of the actions and events in the plot. Regarding emotions, it is important to track the emotions of both the characters and the reader as the plot unfolds. Our contention is that a captivating short story has a clever plot, has multiple agents with different points of view, has a complex texture of emotions, and has harmony among these components. No doubt, there are other wheels that amplify the aesthetic experience, such as novelty, metaphor, and stylistics (Gibbs 1999; Ibsch et al. 1991; Schmidt 1982; Steen 1994). But our contention is that plot, agency, and emotions are central. Brewer's' structural affect theory'was the first model in discourse psychology that seriously attempted to integrate plot, agency, and emotions (Brewer 1996; Brewer and Lichtenstein 1981; Brewer and Ohtsuka 1988) According to this theory, the emotions of the reader are systematically determined by the configuration of the plot and the knowledge states of various agents.

24478,"This paper proposes that abstract concepts are represented as contextually derived structures. According to this abstract structure theory, abstract concepts are related to mostly temporal and spatial structures that underlie and can be extracted from concrete situations. Linguistic context elements of abstract concepts, such as verbs and prepositions, express these structures, and can thus aid in the acquisition of such concepts. The paper presents results from a corpus study that supports the hypothesis, and discusses implications.We propose that abstract concepts, such as faith or notion, are represented as abstract structures, which represent particular contexts in which they occur. Abstract concepts are not directly perceivable, but are often used in verbal descriptions of situations, or in utterances related to a situation. Such utterances have to unambiguously point out the entity that is referred to by the abstract noun. We argue that the relevant abstract structures can be inferred from their linguistic context, in particular, from verbs and prepositions used with the abstract nouns.",Katja Wiemer-Hastings and Arthur C Graesser,12,9034598904950014687,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,22,,,Contextually representing abstract concepts with abstract structures,https://escholarship.org/content/qt4zt536f8/qt4zt536f8.pdf,22,2000,/scholar?cites=9034598904950014687,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:QYdC8u9Cj1oC
24479,"Soaring software costs make the economic consequences of even minor productivity improvements in the process of software development substantial. Estimates in 1985 place US software costs at $70 billion, worldwide software costs at $140 billion, and the growth rate at 12%(Boehm, 1987). It is also well-known that a large percentage of custom-developed systems are unsuccessful because they are late, over budget, or fail to meet specifications. Maintenance costs that run from two to four times the original development cost of a system are partially a byproduct of this failure (Shemer, 1987). Nevertheless, most informed information systems (IS) researchers and practitioners have recognized that there is no panacea for the problem of software productivity. This is a multifaceted problem that must be attacked on various fronts.From the standpoint of error frequency and error cost, the determination of information requirements is a most crucial stage. It is during this stage that the systems analyst must have the greatest interaction with the user. The direct interview of the user is still a primary means of obtaining the information necessary to begin building a system (Awad, 1985). Some practitioners identify this process indirectly as a source of"" software gaps""(Barnes, 1989) or directly as a"" communication bottleneck""(Hurd, 1989). By and large, very little is known about the role of questioning in the process of information requirements determination.

24480,"As the title of this chapter conveys, we hope to clarify the relationship between context and cognition. Are they bosom buddies, polite acquaintances, mortal enemies, or complete strangers? We hope to persuade the reader that any explanatory theory of either cognition or context must adopt the position that they are bosom buddies. At a minimum, a polite acquaintance is needed for any program of research that aspires to capture the important empirical findings and to be reasonably broad in scope. For the purposes of this chapter, cognition should be construed in its broadest sense. Cognition is not confined to fixed mental capacities that are grounded either in biology, in neurophysiology, or in information theory. Cognition also includes the knowledge embodied in an individual’s culture, social history, and personal goals.It is well beyond the scope of this chapter to offer a rigorous, complete, and accurate definition of context. There have been serious attempts to define context in philosophy (Houts, this volume; Pepper, 1942), in developmental psychology (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, 1986; Cohen & Siegel, this volume; Rogoff, 1982), and in virtually every discipline within the cognitive sciences (eg, linguistics, artificial intelligence, sociology).

Such models will represent a better understanding of how the brains of biological organisms not only form perceptual categories of their environments during development, but also develop effective patterns of behavior through the dynamic self-organization of neurological patterns of activ-ity.",Robert Kozma and Arthur C Graesser,11,10698711525749676185,Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society,,405,Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,Models of ontogenetic development for autonomous adaptive systems,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mJAclUVF8jIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA405&dq=info:mdivznJ1eZQJ:scholar.google.com&ots=eTUVbET7F9&sig=6CBY3fxmp8Xv-x92_PUDrfwUWdo,,2001,/scholar?cites=10698711525749676185,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:Dip1O2bNi0gC
24491,"When individuals answer questions, they tap multiple sources of information that embody world knowledge. We assume that each information source is a structured database containing content nodes that are connected by relational arcs. Structured databases are incorporated in various types of information systems, such as intelligent tutoring systems, expert systems, and decision support systems. We also assume that there are a variety of question-answering strategies that produce good answers by accessing particular information sources and systematically selecting nodes within each information source. A psychological theory of question answering would (at minimum) document the question-answering strategies that are associated with different categories of questions. Consider a scenario in which an experienced computer user is teaching a novice how to use a computer system. Suppose that the novice asks the following question:"" Why do you save your program every 15 minutes?"" One strategy of answering this question consists of a logical trace of facts and rules that justifies the action of saving the program. This strategy is precisely the one that many rule-based expert systems execute when"" why"" questions are answered (Buchanan & Shortliffe, 1984). This logic-based strategy could produce Answer 1 as follows.Answer 1. There is some likelihood that the computer will crash (1). The amount of wasted programming work should be minimized (2). If the computer system crashes, you will lose all work since the last time you saved the program (3).

The results indicated that, irrespective of tutor, students’ ratings of engagement, enjoyment, and perceived learning decreased across sessions, but these ratings were not correlated with actual learning gains.

We investigated a method to track engagement during self-paced reading by analyzing reading times. We propose that a breakdown in the relationship between reading time and text complexity can reveal disengagement. A discrepancy (or decoupling) between attention resources and text complexity was computed via the absolute difference between reading times and the text’s Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, a measure of text complexity. As expected, decoupling varied as a function of text complexity. We also found that text complexity differentially impacted decoupling profiles for different types of participants (ie, high vs. low comprehenders, fast vs. slow readers).

24525,"Providing the optimal level of desired challenge and flow during instruction can be difficult for any type of educational/learning setting (ie, traditional classroom-based instruction, one-to-one peer tutoring, online/hybrid learning environments, etc.). The delicate art of scaffolding has been a key area of interest among educational researchers and psychologists over the last 30 years due to its advantage in promoting learning educational environments. According to Wood, Bruner, and Ross (1976), scaffolding was originally defined as an “adult controlling those elements of the task that are essentially beyond the learner’s capacity, thus permitting him to concentrate upon and complete only those elements that are within his range of competence”(p. 9). With the scaffolding process, learners are able to carry out a task, achieve a goal, or solve a problem that they could not on their own accord. Although not originally connected, scaffolding is often explained in terms of Vygotsky’s ZPD, which suggests that learning is a social process that elevates the learner from their actual development level to a “higher level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance and in collaboration with more capable peers”(Vygotsky, 1978, p. 86). A scaffold is considered to be a temporary support and is gradually removed (“faded”) once the learner reaches their potential and becomes sufficient at performing the task on his/her own. The overall notion is that a novice can best reach his/her learning potential with scaffolding provided by a more knowledgeable adult/expert, ie, a parent, teacher, tutor, peer (Lajoie, 2005; Puntambekar & …",Heather K Holden and Anne M Sinatra,8,3993981792421700547,Design recommendations for intelligent tutoring systems,,265-282,,Instructional strategies for ITSs,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BNWEBAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA265&dq=info:w2OseEd5bTcJ:scholar.google.com&ots=jKj4FyJj3F&sig=gow6AzmS8Z99e1-bvgLWasW4Lnk,2,2014,/scholar?cites=3993981792421700547,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:TiIbgCYny7sC

24536,"I. INTRODUCTION|| success cases in computational discourse demonstrate that it is not too early to build automatic systems of discourse analysis. However, there is a large road ahead of us. One of the challenges in computational discourse lies in evaluating how well the computer system is performing. One solution is to compare the computer output to human experts. For example, in the assessments of Foltz's Automated Essay Grader, the grades generated by the computer had a correlation of. 73 with an expert human grader, whereas a pair of human experts correlated. 71. This is indeed impressive performance—a clear success case. The problems surface when human judges disagree and therefore there is no solid gold standard. All scientific analyses of discourse requires a modicum of agreement among discourse analysts regarding the (a) assignment of discourse excerpts to particular theoretical categories (eg, speech act categories, genre categories, main vs. subordinate ideas) or (b) ratings of dis-course excerpts on theoretical dimensions (eg, hierarchical level, dis-course focus, whether an author has an intention). That is why good discourse researchers report interjudge agreement scores in all of their discourse analyses. Unfortunately, some discourse categories and dimensions are so abstract, subtle, or murky that there is not a sufficient foundation for researchers to agree. Nevertheless, to be fair, this is not a unique problem for the discourse level of language analysis.

24540,"Learner modeling is a central component in any tutoring system that also claims to be intelligent. A learner model is a set of learner characteristics that impact learning and therefore is important for adapting instruction to each individual learner and thereby maximize learning. Indeed, research has shown that learners’ diverse backgrounds require tailoring instruction to each individual learner or, more realistically in classroom settings, to homogeneous groups of learners (Corcoran, Mosher, & Rogat, 2009). It should be noted that a major advantage of computerbased instruction, including Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), over classroom instruction is the potential of offering tailored instruction to each and every learner. These systems presumably can be scaled up in the sense that once developed for one user they could be easily replicated or modified to handle many users. Learner modeling is a particular case of user modeling, which constitutes a central component in any user adaptive system. User adaptive systems tailor their behavior to the individual user’s characteristics in order to optimize the value of their function with respect to the user (Conati, Gertner, & VanLehn, 2002; VanLehn, 2006). We focus here on user models in ITSs, ie on learner models.The learner model plays a role in both the outer and inner loop of ITSs (VanLehn, 2006). The outer loop handles macro-adaptivity in the sense that it selects tasks and other instructional materials to present to the learner. The outer loop also selects a mode for the task, eg, demonstrating a step-by-step solution to the task or just providing hints. The inner loop manages the tutor-tutee interaction …",Vasile Rus and William Baggett and Elizabeth Gire and Don Franceschetti and Mark Conley and Arthur Graesser,7,6509147938312489601,Learner Models.

To many of us who are active in discourse psychology, it is Tom who had the intellectual vision and genuine passion that was needed to launch the field. That vision was needed to sell our ideas to experimental psychologists, cognitive scientists, and to members of the various disciplines that contribute to discourse analysis. The passion was needed for everyone to stay motivated during the confused, unsettled stage when the field was discovering and inventing itself.Tom Trabasso’s role in launching discourse psychology is a matter of public record. He was the obvious choice to be the first president of the Society for Text and Discourse (ST&D) in 1991. It was Tom who made ST&D a legal entity, while Bruce Britton prepared the bylaws and Art Graesser arranged for Discourse Processes to be the official journal of the Society. The first meeting of the annual ST&D conference was held within a few miles of Tom’s laboratory at the University of Chicago.

24552,"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) plays an important role in analyzing text data from education settings. LSA represents meaning of words and sets of words by vectors from a k-dimensional space generated from a selected corpus. While the impact of the value of k has been investigated by many researchers, the impact of the selection of documents and the size of the corpus has never been systematically investigated. This paper tackles this problem based on the performance of LSA in evaluating learners’ answers to AutoTutor, a conversational intelligent tutoring system. We report the impact of document sources (Wikipedia vs TASA), selection algorithms (keyword based vs random), corpus size (from 2000 to 30000 documents) and number of dimensions (from 2 to 1000). Two AutoTutor tasks are used to evaluate the performance of different LSA spaces: a phrase level answer assessment (responses to focal prompt questions) and a sentence level answer assessment (responses to hints). We show that a sufficiently large (eg, 20,000 to 30,000 documents) randomly selected Wikipedia corpus with high enough dimensions (about 300) could provide a reasonably good space. A specifically selected domain corpus could have significantly better performance with a relatively smaller corpus size (about 8000 documents) and much lower dimensionality (around 17). The widely used TASA corpus (37,651 documents scientifically sampled) performs equally well as a randomly selected large Wikipedia corpus (20,000 to 30,000) with a sufficiently high dimensionality (eg, k>= 300).",Zhiqiang Cai and Arthur C Graesser and Leah Windsor and Qinyu Cheng and David W Shaffer and Xiangen Hu,6,14696812291361493198,Journal of educational data mining,,,,Impact of corpus size and dimensionality of LSA spaces from Wikipedia articles on AutoTutor answer evaluation,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10098439,,2018,/scholar?cites=14696812291361493198,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:1YatL4jblGcC

24594,"This paper describes the purpose, goals, and guiding questions for the Adaptive Instructional System (AIS) standards workshop within the 2018 Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) Conference Industry Track. Adaptive instructional systems (AISs) use human variability, learner goals and preferences, and other learner/team attributes along with instructional conditions to develop/select appropriate strategies (domain-independent policies) and tactics (actions). The goal of adaptive instruction is to optimize learning, performance, retention, and the transfer of skills between training environments and the work or operational environment where the skills learned during training are to be applied. The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Learning Technologies Standards Committee (LTSC) established a study group in December 2017 to evaluate the efficacy of AIS standards and the authors of this paper proposed this workshop (and several others) to inform stakeholders and solicit their participation. The interaction with stakeholders at the ITS conference will be through the ideas presented in paper presentations and via an expert panel composed of the authors of this paper and other authors in this workshop.",Robert Sottilare and Avron Barr and Robby Robson and Xiangen Hu and Arthur Graesser,4,6829218558861583656,Proceedings of the Adaptive Instructional Systems Workshop in the Industry Track of the 14th International Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,49-53,,Exploring the opportunities and benefits of standards for adaptive instructional systems (AISs),https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Sottilare/publication/328296318_Exploring_the_Opportunities_and_Benefits_of_Standards_for_Adaptive_Instructional_Systems_AISs/links/5bc52f87458515f7d9bf1914/Exploring-the-Opportunities-and-Benefits-of-Standards-for-Adaptive-Instructional-Systems-AISs.pdf,,2018,/scholar?cites=6829218558861583656,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:djft3U1LymYC
24595,"In the United States, more than 15 % of adults are struggling with low literacy skills. Adults who struggle with reading are a heterogeneous group with an extremely varied set of skills and experiences. Difficult circumstances often dictate their ability to attend classes regularly thus leading to problems in their ability to engage with and retain learning strategies. The Center for the Study of Adult Literacy (CSAL) has designed an adaptive, web-based instructional tutor that could meet the struggling adult learners' needs for individualized instruction and emotional support. Each CSAL AutoTutor lesson utilizes two computerized agents (a peer agent and a tutor agent) in a trialogue conversation with the adult learner. These agents give the learner guidance, support, and a narrative through which to view each lesson. The agents also allow the adult learner the opportunity to interact and collaborate in a range of scenarios …",Arthur C Graesser and Whitney Baer and Shi Feng and Breya Walker and Danielle Clewley and David P Hays and Daphne Greenberg,4,7603588393780167308,,,3-25,Academic Press,Emotions in adaptive computer technologies for adults improving reading,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128018569000013,,2016,/scholar?cites=7603588393780167308,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:ufKn5pxu7C0C
24596,"AutoTutor started as an intelligent tutoring system that teaches conceptual sciences by holding natural language conversations with learners (Graesser, Wiemer-Hastings, Wiemer-Hastings, & Kreuz, 1999). Since the 1990s, several AutoTutor systems have been developed, including the earlier ones that teach physics, computer literacy and the later ones that teach critical thinking skills (Forsyth, Graesser, Pavlik, Cai, Butler, Halpern, & Millis, 2013), adult literacy (CSAL AutoTutor), and others. AutoTutor Conversation Engine (ACE) is the first external tutoring service integrated into releases of GIFT (Sottilare, Holden, Goldberg, & Brawner, 2013; Nye, Hu, Graesser, & Cai, 2014). In GIFT, AutoTutor is responsible for handling intelligent natural language conversations (Sottilare, 2014).GAMETE (Game-based Architecture for Mentor-Enhanced Training Environments) provided a practical example of linking ACE to game-based learning environments (Engimann, Santarelli, Zachary, Hu, Cai, Mall & Goldberg, 2014). GAMETE sets up links between AutoTutor and a game environment, TC3sim (Tactical Combat Casualty Care Simulation). Learners’ performance in TC3sim is used to determine what AutoTutor conversation to invoke. Learners’ performance in the AutoTutor conversation is used to decide the next step of the game. This kind of integration is “interruptive”, in the sense that any time a conversation starts, the game interaction is interrupted. A learner does not interact with the game until the conversation ends.",Zhiqiang Cai and Arthur C Graesser and Xiangen Hu and Benjamin D Nye,4,12778342849977981840,Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) Users Symposium (GIFTSym3),,169,,CSAL AutoTutor: integrating rich media with AutoTutor,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EaeDDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA169&dq=info:kBsXlx7LVbEJ:scholar.google.com&ots=66WwEnMoXv&sig=31tcZ1fhTai-R2hy2E0lvkSySMY,,2015,/scholar?cites=12778342849977981840,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:zdX0sdgBH_kC

However, it is unclear to what extent these formality metrics are similar to the formality construct perceived by humans. This study first investigated what linguistic features predicted the text formality as humans constructed, then developed a weighted formality model, and finally tested this measure in different approaches. The corpus of this study consisted of 390 excerpts in TASA corpus with three genres: language arts, social studies and science. The five Coh-Metrix dimensions were used to develop the weighted formality model. Results showed the weighted model perceived by humans was constructed by five dimensions as theories constructed, but each dimension contributed differently to formality construct. This formality model was evaluated through comparisons between human construct of formality, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and genres.

24601,"Digital instructional technology can be designed to adapt education and training to provide each individual learner with a unique experience that is tailored to their aptitude, prior learning, interests, and goals. While there are a number of potential ways in which digital technology could adapt, most systems typically implement only a few. Durlach and Spain (2014) proposed a Framework for Instructional Technology (FIT), which lays out various ways of implementing mastery learning, corrective feedback, and support using digital technology. The framework provides terminology that allows researchers, developers, and designers to characterize instructional systems with greater precision than merely labeling a system as adaptive. FIT can be used to specify precisely how it is adaptive. In FIT, mastery learning is broken down into two separate components, micro-sequencing and macro-sequencing. Micro-sequencing applies to situations in which a given mastery criterion has yet to be met, and a system must determine what learning activity will best promote mastery of the current goal. It can roughly be equated with remediation. Macro-sequencing applies to situations in which a mastery criterion has just been reached and a system must determine the new mastery goal, and what learning activity to provide next. It can be equated with progression to a new topic or deeper level of understanding. For each of the four system behaviors (micro-sequencing, macro-sequencing, corrective feedback, and support), FIT outlines five different methods of potential implementation. Except for macro-sequencing, the five methods of implementation fall along a …",Paula J Durlach,4,16973128721753608200,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,297-310,,Support in a framework for instructional technology,https://www.memphis.edu/iis/projects/pdfs/design-recommendations-its-volume2.pdf#page=332,2,2014,/scholar?cites=16973128721753608200,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:dj1AAMDQi3QC

24603,"Time costs for authoring content have traditionally been a hurdle for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). This paper introduces a novel form-based authoring tool for rapidly developing natural language intelligent tutoring dialogs and trialogs. This tool is designed to have a minimal learning curve and require no understanding of programming, formal logic, or rule-based systems. These tutoring scripts are based on the Shareable Knowledge Object (SKO) framework and the AutoTutor tutoring engine. Tutoring content is authored by instructors or content specialists in a step-by-step process through web-based forms, which are stored in cloud servers. These objects are processed to populate tutoring scripts that drive dynamic interactions with learners. Up to three trialogs can be authored to form a series (eg, an introduction, main dialog, and exit dialog). These conversations can be either interactive tutoring sessions or vicarious dialogs (eg, agents talking to each other). The SKO tutoring modules generated by this system can be delivered using AutoTutor Lite and AutoTutor Web services, which are integrated with recent versions of the GIFT framework. Challenges and opportunities for this authoring tool are discussed.Authoring tools for ITSs are an important topic for reducing the cost and expanding the applications for ITSs. Considering that estimates for ITS content development can range up to 200 hours of development for a single hour of instruction, rapid authoring tools are vital for scalability (Koedinger et al., 2004).

We discuss these in the context of an expert system for scriptwriting which assists in plot construction.

The six stages in this method are: (1) becoming familiar with the topic, (2) free generation of key concepts, (3) question answering on information from the free generation task, (4) problem solving in the context of a particular exemplar, (5) exemplar generation, and (6) modifying and critiquing the prototype.

While diverse in perspectives, these theories and models uniformly agree that essential aspects of complex problem solving include iteration and inquiry.

What is needed, but not adequately articulated and validated, is a theoretical taxonomy of question-asking to better understand and guide a learner’s reasoning process.

24620,"The World Wide Web plays a central role in our daily reading activities. Whenever inclined, we can rapidly access, understand, and use an amazing amount of information from a broad spectrum of the most up-to-date resources. However, many have argued that this unbridled access may be cause for concern. In particular, professional gatekeeping is essentially absent on the Internet. Virtually anyone can publish regardless of topic expertise, credibility, and for the most part accountability. Accordingly, readers routinely encounter misinformation that has been provided, intentionally or unintentionally, even if they are unaware. This reality poses the question: Are people optimally prepared to engage in inquiry using resources they find on the web? In prior eras, most documents were written and edited by professionals so the reader of expository texts could reasonably assume that the information was correct. In modern times, the preponderance of misinformation requires that we take on a greater responsibility to face and overcome additional challenges during reading. As in the past, successful comprehension requires an ability to engage in basic reading skills adequately, such as decoding print, identifying the meaning of words, interpreting sentences, and getting the gist of a text. However, comprehending digital resources additionally requires a more active, constructive process in which the individual has to reflect critically on what is read, what we call a critical stance.

Therefore, we think that measuring and using human opinions, particularly negative ones, about the virtual agent’s responses in real time can play an important role in developing a better responding mechanism.It is challenging to obtain human opinions about the virtual agents in real time for the intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with a single human participant. Post-task surveys are generally used to evaluate how satisfied humans are with the virtual agents at the end of the task. Think-aloud protocols are used to probe how humans interact with the virtual agent in real time. However, the post-task survey approach cannot capture real-time opinions of humans toward the virtual agents, whereas the concurrent thinkaloud approach is often too intrusive and may get in the way of eliciting the real opinions from the human participants.

The proposed conceptualization also fits the general (dictionary) definition of strategy as “a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim” or “pattern in a stream of decisions”(Henry Mintzberg; from Wikipeda entry on Strategy), and tactics as local decisions about “actions”(to be precise, as local decisions to choose actions) in the plan shaped by the strategy.

24635,"The core notion of a learner model is not complex intuitively. We simply need to record, represent, and track characteristics of the learner before, during, and after learning. The mission is accomplished when the learner model accommodates all of the variables that are ever considered in the history and future of intelligent tutoring systems, with all variables being adequately represented for all systems. The theoretical problem is that the set of variables and their representation is not a closed system, but rather grows over time as a moving target. The practical problem is that it is expensive to identify, track, store, update, and later retrieve the ever-growing universal set of variables. The mapping problem is that the alignment between the theoretical variables and computer code is often vague, incomplete, or incompatible. The computational problem is that complex interactions among learner variables create a combinatorial explosion that is temporally insurmountable. In light of these multiple problems, there is no alternative than to pursue sensible compromises.The chapters in this section have identified the major challenges in developing a learner model for GIFT.

24636,"Learner modeling is a central component in any tutoring system that also claims to be intelligent. A learner model is a set of learner characteristics that impact learning, and therefore, is important for adapting instruction to each individual learner and thereby maximize learning. Indeed, research has shown that learners’ diverse backgrounds require tailoring instruction to each individual learner or, more realistically in classroom settings, to homogeneous groups of learners (Corcoran, Mosher & Rogat, 2009). It should be noted that a major advantage of computer-based instruction, including ITSs, over classroom instruction is the potential of offering tailored instruction to each and every learner. These systems presumably can be scaled up in the sense that once developed for one user they could be easily replicated or modified to handle many users. Learner modeling is a particular case of user modeling, which constitutes a central component in any user adaptive system. User adaptive systems tailor their behavior to the individual user’s characteristics in order to optimize the value of their function with respect to the user (Conati, Gertner & VanLehn, 2002; VanLehn, 2006). We focus here on user models in ITSs, ie, on learner models.The learner model plays a role in both the outer and inner loop of ITSs (VanLehn, 2006).

In order to explore the space of possible predictors that the system could use to infer verb meanings, we performed a statistical analysis of the corpus that had been used to test the computational system. There were various syntactic and semantic features of the verbs that were significantly diagnostic in determining verb meaning. We also evaluated human performance at inferring the verb in the same set of sentences. The overall number of correct predictions for humans was quite similar to that of the computational system, but humans had higher precision scores.

24662," Coding is a process of assigning meaning to a given piece of evidence. Evidence may be found in a variety of data types, including documents, research interviews, posts from social media, conversations from learning platforms, or any source of data that may provide insights for the questions under qualitative study. In this study, we focus on text data and consider coding as a process of identifying words or phrases and categorizing them into codes to facilitate data analysis. There are a number of different approaches to generating qualitative codes, such as grounded coding, a priori coding, or using both in an iterative process. However, both qualitative and quantitative analysts face the same coding problem: when the data size is large, manually coding becomes impractical. nCoder is a tool that helps researchers to discover and code key concepts in text data with minimum human judgements.

24663,"There are four components in a minimalist model of Self-Improvable Adaptive Systems (SIAIS)(Hu, Tong, Cai, Cockroft, & Kim, 2019). These four components are 1) human learners that are assumed constantly self-improving (ie, learning); 2) self-improvable learning resources that are either human resources (trainers/teachers, for example) or digital resources such as digital tutors which are capable of changing (improving) constantly; 3) learning environments that are diverse physical or virtual locations, contexts, and cultures in which students learn; 4) learning processes that are instructional sequence for any given domain for particular learner groups (such as grades). One publicly available important framework for self-improvable digital resource in SIAIS is Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), which is an empirically-based, service-oriented framework of tools, methods and standards to make it easier to author computer-based tutoring systems (CBTS), manage instruction and assess the effect of CBTS, components and methodologies (“Overview-GIFT-GIFT Portal,” nd).

24664,"Most of existing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) applications involve one or at most two interactive conversational avatars (CAs) and one student (Graesser et al., 2012; Hu, Morrison, & Cai, 2013). It is reasonable to consider a case where using multiple (two or more) avatars and multiple human learners are copresent in the same interactive intelligent tutoring environment (IITE). This chapter explores a computational model that assesses the quality of contributions of avatars and the verbal behavior of human learners during a sequence of turns in natural language interactions, where a “turn” in a conversation is the time one of the participants contribute. The total number of turns is the total number of contributions. This approach is a further development of an earlier chapter (Hu, Morrison, & CAI, 2013) in volume I of this series.The collaborative exchanges we consider in this chapter follow some specific assumptions in the application scenarios, as specified below.

24667,"The development of a complex, adaptive learning platform presents many challenges, particularly in difficult topics like electrical engineering that require deep understanding of technical concepts and their interrelationships. One approach to handling this challenge is to build a system that integrates an ensemble of adaptive intelligent learning environments as well as static learning resources (technical manuals, diagrams, simulations) so that the right resource is delivered to the right person at the right time. We instantiated this approach in a project funded by the Office of Naval Research with technology and learning standards guided by the Army Research Laboratory and Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative.

24672,"Conversation-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) attempt to help students learn by holding a conversation in natural language. Most of the systems consist of dialogues between the human learner and the computer tutor, who take turns in the conversation. Two or more agents can also hold conversations with a learner. For example, in trialogues the learner interacts with two agents, such as a tutor and a peer, or two peers. Trialogues allow the ITS to exhibit conversation skills, for the learner to view, in addition to advancing the learning of the subject matter. Most of these dialogue-based ITSs also have external media, such as a picture, table, diagram, or interactive simulation. The designers of conversation-based ITSs need to worry about the coordination and timing of the conversational turns among the learners, agents, and dynamic external media. Designers of these ITSs also need to worry about what each agent looks like. An agent can vary from a minimalist depiction of the human persona (such as a chat message) to a very realistic depiction, such a fully embodied avatar in a virtual world.The core of the conversation-based ITSs resides in natural language, discourse, and communication. There are three basic tasks in these conversation systems:(1) interpret the meaning of the learner’s language and discourse,(2) assess how these verbal contributions might update the student model on knowledge, skills, and strategies, and (3) generate tutor dialogue moves that advance the pedagogical agenda. The authoring tools need incorporate components that accommodate all of these tasks in addition to creating the agent persona and …",Arthur Graesser,2,3459086554678680444,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,195,,Authoring conversation-based tutors,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Sottilare/publication/278620644_Design_Recommendations_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_-_Volume_3_Authoring_Tools_and_Expert_Modeling_Techniques/links/55a2415c08aea815dffc1c70/Design-Recommendations-for-Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems-Volume-3-Authoring-Tools-and-Expert-Modeling-Techniques.pdf#page=217,,2015,/scholar?cites=3459086554678680444,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:fixghrsIJ_wC
24673,"Interdisciplinary approaches to identifying, understanding, and remediating people's reliance on inaccurate information that they should know to be wrong. Our lives revolve around the acquisition of information. Sometimes the information we acquire—from other people, from books, or from the media—is wrong. Studies show that people rely on such misinformation, sometimes even when they are aware that the information is inaccurate or invalid. And yet investigations of learning and knowledge acquisition largely ignore encounters with this sort of problematic material. This volume fills the gap, offering theoretical and empirical perspectives on the processing of misinformation and its consequences. The contributors, from cognitive science and education science, provide analyses that represent a variety of methodologies, theoretical orientations, and fields of expertise. The chapters describe the behavioral consequences of relying on misinformation and outline possible remediations; discuss the cognitive activities that underlie encounters with inaccuracies, investigating why reliance occurs so readily; present theoretical and philosophical considerations of the nature of inaccuracies; and offer formal, empirically driven frameworks that detail when and how inaccuracies will lead to comprehension difficulties.

24682,"A nimated conversational agents play a central role in some visions of advanced learning environments. Imagine a virtual world that has a close correspondence with everyday scenarios and problems, with human-like cyber agents that interact with students and help them learn by holding a con-versation in natural language. The cyber agents may take on different roles: mentors, tutors, peers, players in multiparty games, or avatars in the virtual worlds. The students communicate with the agents through speech, keyboard, gesture, touch-panel screen, or conventional input channels. In turn, the agents express themselves with speech, facial expression, gesture, posture, and other embodied actions. In essence, students and agents have face-to-face conversations in the con-text of authentic situations and problems. The students are highly engaged in their interactions with the agents in the virtual worlds because the system dynamically adapts to their cognitive, emotional, and motivational states. The entire system is also embedded in a game environment in which the students score points to the extent that their speech and actions reflect mastery of the material. These are serious games—games that help the students acquire important academic and techni-cal content. This vision of virtual worlds with agents is not science fiction. Outstanding examples of virtual environments with agents are those developed at the University of Southern California, funded by the US Army, National Science Foundation (NSF), and other agencies.

Two important speech act categories are evaluations and suggestions. Latent semantic analysis and principal components analyses helped us discover clusters of comments involving evaluations and suggestions. The comments of mentors were also significantly aligned with epistemic frame elements that motivate the comments at a deeper level of discourse and pedagogy. Such alignments were validated by logistic regression analyses on a sample of handcoded judgments of the frame elements.

Participants searched a set of websites on the causes of the eruption of Mount St. Helens. SEEK was designed to encourage students' critical thinking through several devices: spoken hints on a Google search page, pop-up questions and ratings on dimensions of critical stance (PUR), and a pop-up journal on critical stance (PUJ). We assessed whether SEEK improved students' critical thinking compared with a"" search only""(Navigation) control condition. SEEK did improve the critical thinking, as manifested in essays on causes of the volcanic eruption, but did not improve learning gains and students' ability to differentiate the quality of sites.

The ATEC system presents a battlefield situation and then initiates a dialog between a virtual mentor instructional agent and a student as they collaboratively discuss the situation. The virtual mentor poses questions, evaluates student responses, determines the sequence of questions, and ultimately assesses performance on the basis of the specificity of questioning and the depth of probing and hinting that is needed to adequately answer the questions. The results of the ATEC development effort showed some of the capabilities and limitations of tutorial dialog systems, and indicated areas for additional research and development.Descriptors:",Joan M Ryder and Arthur C Graesser and Jean-Christophe Le Mentec and Max M Louwerse and Ashish Karnavat,2,1331566975874552107,,,,CHI SYSTEMS INC FORT WASHINGTON PA,A dialog-based intelligent tutoring system for practicing battle command reasoning,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA425430,,2004,/scholar?cites=1331566975874552107,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:nRpfm8aw39MC

24693,"Multiple agents are constructed when a reader deeply comprehends a novel or short story. Each agent has human qualities in the sense that the agent is capable of speaking, perceiving, believing, knowing, wanting, acting, and experiencing emotions. There is a society of character agents, those within the space of the storyworld. These character agents include the protagonists, the antagonists, minor characters, and characters that are functionally props. There normally is one agent for each character in the storyworld, although it is possible in principle for multiple agents in the mind to be attached to a single character referent. For example, Superman and Clark Kent are conceptually two separate agents but the same referent. A novel about a person with multiple personalities (Sibyl or The Three Faces of Eve) would have one character in flesh and blood but functionally several agents in the reader's mind. When a character radically changes in a literary narrative, a reader might construct functionally separate agents, as in the case of the child being different than the adult in an autobiography or the case of a character being inflicted with amnesia and ending up fundamentally transformed. However, these complex and fuzzy instances of agency are not the concern of this article. There was only one agent per character in the storyworlds associated with the literary short stories that we investigated. In addition to the society of character agents, there is a second ensemble of agents that we will call pragmatic agents. The pragmatic agents include the narrator, narratee, writer, imaginary reader, and actual reader.

24701,"This chapter describes some attempts to promote deep learning through principles of learning science and technologies with computer agents. Learning environments with conversational agents have been developed to serve as substitutes for human tutors, teachers, peers, and students. The agents can be programmed to apply learning science principles systematically at varying degrees of computational sophistication. The most rudimentary agents deliver instruction, tell the learners what to do next, and interact with other agents to model ideal behavior, strategies, reflections, and social interactions. Intelligent agents are adaptive to the learners’ actions, verbal contributions, emotions, and other psychological states. For example, AutoTutor helps students learn by holding a dialogue in natural language or staging a three-way trialogue that has two agents interacting with the student. These agentbased systems have often facilitated deep learning more than conventional learning environments on a variety of subject matters and skills, including science, technology, engineering, mathematics, research methods, metacognition, and reading comprehension.

How do we handle different roles of users?

24718,"An authoritative overview of current research on human attention, emphasizing the relation between cognitive phenomena observed in the laboratory and in the real world. Laboratory research on human attention has often been conducted under conditions that bear little resemblance to the complexity of our everyday lives. Although this research has yielded interesting discoveries, few scholars have truly connected these findings to natural experiences. This book bridges the gap between “laboratory and life” by bringing together cutting-edge research using traditional methodologies with research that focuses on attention in everyday contexts. It offers definitive reviews by both established and rising research stars on foundational topics such as visual attention and cognitive control, underrepresented domains such as auditory and temporal attention, and emerging areas of investigation such as mind wandering and embodied attention. The contributors discuss a range of approaches and methodologies, including psychophysics, mental chronometry, stationary and mobile eye-tracking, and electrophysiological and functional brain imaging. Chapters on everyday attention consider such diverse activities as driving, shopping, reading, multitasking, and playing videogames. All chapters present their topics in the same overall format: historical context, current research, the possible integration of laboratory and real-world approaches, future directions, and key and outstanding issues.

24719,"AutoTutor is a class of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that helps students learn by holding a conversation in natural language (Graesser et al., 2004, 2012; Nye, Graesser & Hu, in press). AutoTutor’s intelligent conversation framework has been integrated into many learning systems that range from tutorial dialogues on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics (such as computer literacy, and physics) to trialogues (ie, two agents and a human) on critical thinking and reading comprehension (Graesser, Li & Forsyth, 2014; Millis et al., 2011; Halpern et al., 2012; Forsyth et al., 2013). Examples of trialogues under construction (https://www. youtube. com/channel/UCGoWLJj6BXZ6X2KIRLYrgZw) can be viewed for a more concrete illustration of the nature of these conversations. AutoTutor is an advanced conversation framework that can be used to generate conversation scripts and be integrated into most learning systems. AutoTutor takes the learner’s typed verbal contributions, speech, and actions as input and accommodates events in different media to trigger or change paths of conversations. It also sends commands to the learning system for execution, such as presenting pictures and launching scenarios (Cai, Feng, Baer & Graesser, 2014).There are many steps in composing an AutoTutor conversation with one or more computer agents and a human learner. Authoring an AutoTutor conversation includes preparing spoken contributions for each computer agent, specifying conditions at which a speech is delivered, determining the points at which human learners’ responses and/or environmental events are expected …",Arthur Graesser and Xiangen Hu,1,14536321693517835702,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Authoring Tools and Expert Modeling Techniques,,199,Robert Sottilare,AutoTutor script authoring tool,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=uL3mCQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA199&dq=info:tm3vQpBju8kJ:scholar.google.com&ots=uaRgjFuzNb&sig=QEeLR6GDY0valtUQjFYUYIZKjfU,,2015,/scholar?cites=14536321693517835702,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:Nnq8S6OXqDYC
24720,"It is widely believed that information in print, spoken, and digital media is replete with inaccuracies, especially now that there is less editing of content in most media outlets. Inaccurate information may range from a single sentence that conveys a fact or claim to lengthy discourse that incorporates a deeply flawed mental model. Sometimes there are explicit contradictions within a text or between texts. At other times the contradictions require inferences and careful scrutiny with respect to prior knowledge. This is impossible or difficult for readers who have low knowledge about the subject matter. They cannot identify false information or resolve contradictions without conceptual knowledge about the domain. Individuals respond in a variety of ways to these inaccuracies. The most gullible readers accept virtually all content as true and miss most contradictions. The most skeptical readers question the veracity of most content and are on the lookout for contradictions. Most individuals undoubtedly fall somewhere in between these two extremes on the gullible–skeptical continuum. Most of the chapters in this volume investigate how individuals by themselves process and respond to the inaccurate information. Do readers notice such information? Do they ask questions about it? Do they discard it? Do they abandon the information source altogether? Do they read a different information source to check it out? Do they challenge the author?

This is part of a larger project that aims at investigating the language of leaders and how their language changes over their stay in power. Here, we analyze the speeches of a leader who stayed in power for a long period of time, ie more than 30 years. We measure cohesion of speeches in the original language, which is Arabic in our case, as well as in English, based on human translations of the original speeches. The cohesion is measured in two different ways: using word overlap and Latent Semantic Analysis. Because of the morphological complexity of Arabic, the word overlap measure of cohesion becomes challenging in Arabic. Latent Semantic Analysis, which is totally unsupervised, is applied similarly for Arabic and English. The results show that cohesion has a general down trend over time and that during and after major crises the leader’s speeches exhibit an increase in cohesion which can be explained as an attempt on leader’s behalf to make his policies more clear, most likely as a form of post-crisis management.",Lubna Shala and Vasile Rus and Arthur C Graesser,1,13789127939940112927,,,,,A bilingual analysis of cohesion in a corpus of leader speeches,http://www.cs.memphis.edu/~vrus/publications/2014/FLAIRS-14.ShalaRus.pdf,,2014,/scholar?cites=13789127939940112927,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:OzeSX8-yOCQC

With each new word, participants decided whether the sentences came from a narrative, science, or history text.

This study develops a method for automatically categorizing noun phrases into one of three categories of givenness/newness, using the taxonomy of Prince (1981) as the gold standard. The central computational technique used is span (Hu et al., 2003), a derivative of latent semantic analysis (LSA). We analyzed noun phrases from two expository and two narrative texts. Predictors of newness included span as well as pronoun status, determiners, and word overlap with previous noun phrases.

24739,"One-on-one tutoring that encourages students to explain their answers has long been known to be an effective means of increasing student performance, even when the tutors are far from experts in the field concerned (eg, Chi, de Leeuw, Chiu, and LaVancher, 1994; Bloom, 1984). The design of effective Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) is an area of active research that attempts to take advantage of the benefits of this type of tutoring with the added convenience of automated, just-in-time teaching interventions. Validating ITS dialogues requires comparison with human tutors constrained to conditions similar to those found in ITS interfaces. A basic assumption in the design of ITS is that student productions (questions, statements, and side comments) can be categorized in a way that permits selection of an appropriate tutor response. Advanced ITSs attempt to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) components to give the student an intervention tailored to their specific needs. For these systems to work, a detailed modeling of the conversations that occur during a domain specific tutoring session is desirable. This study addresses two questions posed by the comparison of ITSs to human tutors. The first is the degree of variance that can be expected between expert tutors in a given discipline, in this instance physics. The second is the extent to which the productions of expert tutors vary from one tutor to another and if experience has any impact on the set of dialog moves employed by domain expert tutors.

24753,"I have proposed previously that language comprehension can be described as structure building, and I have sketched a simple framework to use as a guide. I call this framework the Structure Building Framework. According to the Structure Building Framework, the goal of comprehension is to build cohesive mental representations, or structures. The first process involved in building a structure is laying a foundation. The next process involves developing the structure by mapping on incoming information when that information coheres with the pre vious information. However, if the incoming information is less coherent, com prehenders employ a different process: They shift to initiate a new substructure. Thus, most representations comprise several branching substructures. The building blocks of mental structures are memory nodes. Memory nodes are activated by incoming stimuli. Their initial activation forms the foundation of mental structures. Incoming information often is mapped onto a developing structure because the more coherent the incoming information is with the pre vious information, the more likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. How ever, the less coherent the incoming information, the less likely it is to activate similar memory nodes. If the incoming information is less coherent, it activates different nodes, and the activation of these different nodes forms the foundation for a new substructure.",In BK Britton and AC Graesser,1,18356286487689203898,,,289-311,Erlbaum,"The structure-building framework: What it is, what it might also be, and why",https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Morton_Gernsbacher/publication/267509022_The_Structure_Building_Framework_What_it_is_what_it_might_also_be_and_why/links/5757264508ae5c6549042581/The-Structure-Building-Framework-What-it-is-what-it-might-also-be-and-why.pdf,,1996,/scholar?cites=18356286487689203898,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:RVqaWcrwK10C
24754,"Psychological theories of literary comprehension attempt to explain how various types of literary devices influence comprehension, appreciation, and memory for literary text. Each literary device is a conceptual configuration that depends on, and is constrained by, features of the text and the knowledge-base of the reader. With rare exception, a literary de-vice will have no impact on the reader if the reader lacks important world knowledge that is relevant to the text and tacit knowledge about the literary device. Moreover, writers intentionally incorporate literary devices to have particular effects on the reader. Therefore, all three components of a literary communication system must be synchronized for literary comprehension to succeed: the author, the text, and the reader. Psychologists have investigated literary devices at various levels of text analysis. At the surface level, there are systematic phonological patterns (eg, rhyme, alliteration, asso-nance) and syntactic constructions (Van Peer 1986). At the level of sentence meaning, there are different forms of figurative language, such as metaphor, irony, understatement, and hyperbole (Kreuz & Roberts 1993; Steen 1989; Van Peer 1986). The literary devices at the macro level are more diverse, are less well defined, and have received substantially less attention in psychological research. Examples of these macro literary devices include epiphany, deviations from norms, manipulations of point of view (eg, character, narrator, versus writer), plot configurations that map text structure to reader emotion (eg, sus-pense, surprise, curiosity), deliberate ambiguity, and unity in diversity (Brewer & Ohtsuka 1988 …",Arthur C Graesser and Max A Kassler and Katinka Dijkstra and Roger J Kreuz and Rolf A Zwaan and Bonnie McLain Allen,1,8035854006995200542,,,,na,Comprehending Novel Mental Models of Time in Einstein’s Dreams,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8035854006995200542&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1995,/scholar?cites=8035854006995200542,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:CB2v5VPnA5kC

I had found that college students read narrative texts approximately twice as fast as expository texts, yet recall scores were approximately twice as high for the narratives (see Graesser, 198 1). These differences could not be attributed to topic familiarity, word frequency, syntactic complexity, or dozens of other pedestrian variables. A satisfactory explanation was deeper and more fascinating. I was entirely convinced that narrative representations have a privileged status in the cognitive system, a conclusion that has been embraced more recently by Bruner (1986), Schank (1990), and other researchers in the cognitive sciences.

Unfortunately, however, researchers have encountered some serious bottlenecks in their investigations of thesethree areas. This chapter presents an overview of our program of research in cognitive psychology a program that has directly confronted some of the troublesome bottlenecks in advancing a scientific understanding of world knowledge, language comprehension, and reasoning. Consider first some of the problems involved with world knowledge. Individuals have a boundless inventory of concepts, facts, rules, experiences, and routines stored in memory so there is a staggering volume of information that presumably must be examined. Indeed, some researchers are convinced that taking stock of world knowledge is a tedious enterprise to be circumvented at all costs. We believe that such an attitude is shortsighted. We are in a society that is facing a serious information-explosion problem. As the amount of available information increases, an individual's knowledge base becomes more specialized and/or more fragmented. Hirsch's bestseller Cultural Literacy (1987) identified some of the problems in a society of individuals who share very little common knowledge.

24764,"Collaborative learning is a process that involves a group of people working together on a shared learning goal. Traditional classroom collaborative learning requires learners to be at the same location. With internet support, team members can now collaborate online. Many online tutoring systems have been developed to allow learners to participate in group collaborations from distant locations. Collaborators bring different ideas and experiences to the group, working online to construct answers to questions and solutions to problems. Talking is an important feature in collaboration. As Golub (1988) pointed out, it is in the talking that much of the learning occurs. Online collaborative learning environments can easily provide utilities for collaborators to talk through chat or messaging interfaces.Group members in online collaborative learning environments are not necessarily all human. Instead, some can be intelligent computer agents. An intelligent computer agent is a software robot that performs tasks a human user may do on computers. Such agents have “brains” that can find answers to questions or solutions to problems. In addition, they could talk through avatars that can deliver speeches, gesture, and convey emotions. Such talking agents may play different roles, such as a tutor who helps an online student learn specific concepts, a peer student who provides alternative perspectives, a teacher who guides a team through a complete learning path, a facilitator who maintains healthy social interaction among team members, etc. The role a talking agent plays is usually specified by the types of tasks the agent takes, the manner in which the agent …",Zhiqiang Cai and Andrew J Hampton and AC Graesser and Xiangen Hu and Jody L Cockroft and David W Shaffer and Michael C Dorneich,1,4243152152198001892,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,169-177,,Roles of Talking Agents in Online Collaborative Learning Environments,https://gifttutoring.org/attachments/download/3029/Design%20Recommendations%20for%20ITS_Volume%206%20-%20Team%20Tutoring_final.pdf#page=177,6,,/scholar?cites=4243152152198001892,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:QI7uKX5mnFEC

24774,"A fundamental approach to developing self-improving intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is to have different sources of assessment on the quality of the decisions, solutions and algorithms. The sources of assessment can be categorized in various ways, but we identify the major categories as being theoretical models, computational algorithms, human judgments, and empirical performance. Quality is high on the theoretical model front when an implementation (ie, decision, solution, algorithm, or entire system) is compatible with the features of a theory, model, or hypotheses that is widely accepted in scientific research and practice. The quality of a computational algorithm increases to the extent that implementation is fast, efficient, complete, general, interoperable, and so on. There are different stakeholders who can provide human judgments of an implementation: learners, instructors, learning engineers, researchers, and supervisors. Empirical performance includes learning gains, engagement, and other psychological measures that can be objectively measured and that validate the success of an implementation.The main point of this chapter is to make the case that all sources of assessment have limitations that designers of self-improving intelligent tutoring systems (SI-ITSs) need to consider.

However, developing authoring tools for authors to create systems that can be self-improving is still a challenging problem.For over four decades, researchers have been trying to develop computer tutoring systems that could be as effective as professional human tutors (Smith & Sherwood, 1976). The effectiveness of tutoring, either human tutoring or computer tutoring, is usually measured by the relative effect size compared to conventional instructional activities without tutoring. The effect size of professional human tutoring was once expected to be 2.0 (Bloom, 1984), whereas untrained human tutoring and computer tutoring is approximately 0.8 (VanLehn, 2011). The tutoring process is a sequence of interactions between a tutor and an individual student. An effective tutor should be able to guide the student to go through a path that is relatively short, if not the shortest, in a learning process. The tutor helps a student in each step of the learning process by recommending learning content, giving immediate feedback and hints, providing and explaining ideal solutions, correcting misconceptions and answering questions (Graesser, Hu, & Sottilare, 2018).

Evidence may be found in a variety of data types, including documents, research interviews, posts from social media, conversations from learning platforms, or any source of data that may provide insights for the questions under qualitative study. In this study, we focus on text data and consider coding as a process of identifying words or phrases and categorizing them into codes to facilitate data analysis. There are a number of different approaches to generating qualitative codes, such as grounded coding, a priori coding, or using both in an iterative process. However, both qualitative and quantitative analysts face the same coding problem: when the data size is large, manually coding becomes impractical. nCoder is a tool that helps researchers to discover and code key concepts in text data with minimum human judgements. Once reliability and validity are established, nCoder automatically applies the coding scheme to the dataset. However, for concepts that occur infrequently, even with an acceptable reliability, the classifier may still result in too many false negatives. This paper explores these problems within the current nCoder and proposes adding a semantic component to the nCoder.

24779,"Relatedness between user input and an ideal response is a salient feature required for proper functioning of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) using natural language processing. Improper assessment of text input causes maladaptation in ITSs. Meta-assessment of user responses in ITSs can improve instruction efficacy and user satisfaction. Therefore, this paper evaluates the quality of semantic matching between user input and the expected response in AutoTutor, an ITS which holds a conversation with the user in natural language. AutoTutor's dialogue is driven by the AutoTutor Conversation Engine (ACE), which uses a combination of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Regular Expressions (RegEx) to assess user input.

24781,"Navigating a career constitutes one of life’s most enduring challenges, particularly within a unique organization like the US Navy. While the Navy has numerous resources for guidance, accessing and identifying key information sources across the many existing platforms can be challenging for sailors (eg, determining the appropriate program or point of contact, developing an accurate understanding of the process, and even recognizing the need for planning itself). Focusing on intermediate goals, evaluations, education, certifications, and training is quite demanding, even before considering their cumulative long-term implications. These are on top of generic personal issues, such as financial difficulties and homesickness when at sea for prolonged periods. We present the preliminary construction of a conversational intelligent agent designed to provide a user-friendly, adaptive environment that recognizes user input pertinent to these issues and provides guidance to appropriate resources within the Navy. User input from “counseling sessions” is linked, using advanced natural language processing techniques, to our framework of Navy training and education standards, promotion protocols, and organizational structure, producing feedback on resources and recommendations sensitive to user history and stated career goals. The proposed innovative technology monitors sailors’ career progress, proactively triggering sessions before major career milestones or when performance drops below Navy expectations, by using a mixed-initiative design.

24787,"Vector based word representation models are typically developed from very large corpora with the hope that the representations are reliable and have wide coverage, ie they cover, ideally, all words. However, we often encounter words in real world applications that are not available in a single vector-based model. In this paper, we present a novel Neural Network (NN) based approach for obtaining representations for words that are missing in a target model from another model, called the source model, where representations for these words are available, effectively pooling together their vocabularies and the corresponding representations. Our experiments with three different types of pretrained models (Word2vec, GloVe, and LSA) show that the representations obtained using our transformation approach can substantially and effectively extend the word coverage of existing models. The increase in the number of unique words covered by a model varies from few to several times depending on which model vocabulary is taken as reference. The transformed word representations are also well correlated (average correlation up to 0.801 for words in Simlex-999 dataset) with the native target model representations indicating that the transformed vectors can effectively be used as substitutes of native word representations. Furthermore, an extrinsic evaluation based on a word-to-word similarity task using the Simlex-999 dataset leads to results close to those obtained using native target model representations.",Arthur C Graesser and Vasile Rus,0,,"Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing: 18th International Conference, CICLing 2017, Budapest, Hungary, April 17–23, 2017, Revised Selected Papers",,17,Springer,Pooling Word Vector Representations Across Models,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=dDNyDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=info:iwsDIn4dYiYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=qnACImW1o2&sig=kuYQwjHnwYZ20kHqL5UGknfAAdQ,10761,2018,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:MSzX15-gZgkC

24789,"Collaborative learning is a process that involves a group of people working together on a shared learning goal. Traditional classroom collaborative learning requires learners to be at the same location. With internet support, team members can now collaborate online. Many online tutoring systems have been developed to allow learners to participate in group collaborations from distant locations. Collaborators bring different ideas and experiences to the group, working online to construct answers to questions and solutions to problems. Talking is an important feature in collaboration. As Golub (1988) pointed out, it is in the talking that much of the learning occurs. Online collaborative learning environments can easily provide utilities for collaborators to talk through chat or messaging interfaces.Group members in online collaborative learning environments are not necessarily all human. Instead, some can be intelligent computer agents. An intelligent computer agent is a software robot that performs tasks a human user may do on computers. Such agents have “brains” that can find answers to questions or solutions to problems. In addition, they could talk through avatars that can deliver speeches, gesture, and convey emotions. Such talking agents may play different roles, such as a tutor who helps an online student learn specific concepts, a peer student who provides alternative perspectives, a teacher who guides a team through a complete learning path, a facilitator who maintains healthy social interaction among team members, etc. The role a talking agent plays is usually specified by the types of tasks the agent takes, the manner in which the agent …",Zhiqiang Cai and Andrew J Hampton and Art Graesser and Xiangen Hu and Jody L Cockroft and David W Shaffer and Michael C Dorneich,0,,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Volume 6-Team Tutoring,,169,US Army Research Laboratory,ROLES CHAPTER 16–OF TALKING AGENTS IN ONLINE COLLABORATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=-j5qDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA169&dq=info:eDIbHm038ykJ:scholar.google.com&ots=WI1ATjVa5p&sig=0sxxJvlIWQMpyVqzyX7fgVIxJRw,6,2018,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:AkvegQHRDQ8C

24794,"Educators and researchers who analyze discourse from learning contexts increasingly rely on automated analyses of text data. One use case is the development of classifiers that label discourse events, such as turns of talk, based on their semantic content. Such classifiers can be implemented with keyword lists; however, these users may find it difficult to generate lists that thoroughly cover the semantic content they want to identify--that is, they can generate a short list, but may leave out many important words. A tool that suggests words that are highly semantically related to a short word list would thus benefit these users. This paper investigates three LSA based Nearest Neighbor algorithms, including vector sum, subspace and maximum similarity. The vector sum algorithm sums the LSA vectors of given words and finds nearest neighbors using the LSA cosine of word vectors to this combined vector. The subspace algorithm uses the given word vectors to span a subspace and find nearest neighbors according to the vector projection to the subspace. The maximum similarity algorithm uses the maximum similarity of a word to each of the given words to find nearest neighbors. These algorithms were evaluated using word lists from prior studies of student discourse. The results show that (1) the maximum similarity algorithm provides the best suggestions and takes the shortest time when the nearest neighbors of each word are cached;(2) that a domain specific LSA space out performs a general LSA space; and (3) optimal rare word filtering improves performance.",Zhiqiang Cai and Zachari Swiecki and Brendan Eagan and Xiangen Hu and Art C Graesser and David W Shaffer,0,,"Presentation at the Forty-eighth annual meeting of the society for computer in psychology, New Orleans",,,,Suggesting keywords for automated discourse analysis using LSA nearest neighbors,https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10081322,,2018,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:VHM5RxzNINsC

A correlation analysis between theoretical levels and performance (accuracy and time) supported this trend. These results affirm that adults with low literacy tend to have more proficiency for basic reading levels than for deeper discourse levels. In addition, the results of exact binomial test showed that hints or prompts were effective in scaffolding learning reading. Furthermore, we describe how response accuracy on the four comprehension components can provide a more nuanced diagnosis of reading problems than a single overall performance score. More fine-grained diagnoses can assist both educators wanting more detailed insight into learner difficulties, and ITS developers looking to improve the personalization and adaptivity of …",Genghu Shi and Anne M Lippert and Andrew J Hampton and Su Chen and Ying Fang and Arthur C Graesser,0,,,,105-112,,Diagnostic Assessment of Adults' Reading Deficiencies in an Intelligent Tutoring System.,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01911756/file/ITS2018%20Workshop%20proceedings.pdf#page=105,,2018,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:K-tzbvM8PMoC

24801,"As a generalized framework for intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) integrates various types of ITS modules. Among all the modules, conversational ITS modules might be the most complex one, since it adds complex conversations to any type of ITS environment. Each type of module in ITS may have its specific considerations on domain modeling. This chapter presents our experience in domain modeling on “AutoTutor”, which has been integrated as a conversation module in GIFT.The domain model has long been considered as one of the major components of an ITS. For example, Elsom-Cook (1997) assumed that the structure of an ITS is around a “trinity” of components:“the knowledge about the domain being taught, about how to interact with the learner, and about the student.” Murray (1999) described four models in authoring ITSs: the interface model, the domain model, the teaching model, and the student model. In the preface of the first book of this series, Sottilare, Graesser, Hu and Holden (2013) indicated that domain models in an ITS contain “the set of skills, knowledge, and strategies of the topic being tutored.” They added that a domain model “normally contains the ideal expert knowledge and also the bugs, mal-rules, and misconceptions that students periodically exhibit.”",Zhiqiang Cai and Arthur Graesser and Xiangen Hu,0,,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,205,,–Domain Modeling in AutoTutor,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=0suvDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA205&dq=info:WC-DCHa29nIJ:scholar.google.com&ots=6OBjtZ0GV_&sig=3o7sQ5__kKn6EIUWB8od2U0Qq1M,,2016,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:IvSMUa3B7yYC

The chapter argues for a different emphasis than is found in some approaches to narrative an emphasis on situation.

It is hypothesized that disengagement is marked by a decrease in time investment as compared with the demands made on the reader by the text. In this study, self-paced reading times for screens of text were predicted by a text complexity score called formality; formality scores increase with cohesion, informational content/genre, syntactic complexity, and word abstractness as measured by the Coh-Metrix text-analysis program. Cognitive decoupling is defined as the difference between actual reading times and reading times predicted by text formality. Decoupling patterns were found to differ as a function of the serial position of the screens of text and the text genre (ie, informational, persuasive, and narrative) but surprisingly not as a function of reader characteristics (reading speed and comprehension).

In that book, he made a number of astute observations on frowns, the contexts that elicit them, their evolutionary value, their special status in the arsenal of human expressions, and their ubiquity as a form of emotional expression from infancy to mortality. Darwin observed that frowns often accompanied incongruence during deep thought and effortful deliberation, but not during simple reflection, orientation of attention, or meditation. He reasoned that frowns were an expressive correlate of the intention to focus attention on distant objects, which can be achieved by contracting the eye muscles so as to restrict incoming light to objects of immediate relevance. Though once associated with voluntary muscle control in the service of visual perception, Darwin hypothesized that through millions of years of evolution, the frown was involuntarily associated with information seeking, as is the case when one encounters a disruption in a train of thought. Although not explicitly mentioned by Darwin, in some contexts, the furrowed brow is accompanied by feelings of cognitive disequilibrium (Piaget, 1952), or cognitive",Sidney K D’Mello and Arthur C Graesser,0,,International Handbook of Emotions in Education,,289,Routledge,University ofNotre Dame and University ofMemphis,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8_UjAwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA289&dq=info:DXLD3VRULzYJ:scholar.google.com&ots=FbUUnQiKtA&sig=EvBw2LYGzPc0Vh7EQKVPyV-upoE,,2014,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:raTqNPD5sRQC

24811,"The goal of this chapter is to present theory and data that describe a model of argument understanding and conflict resolution. Settling disagreements, disputes, and differences of opinion are among the most frequent activities that take place during conversational interaction in daily life. Not only do conflicts occur among individuals, but they occur among groups at both the national and international levels. Given the frequency and importance of conflictual interaction, and the negative consequences that result when negotiations fail, it is critically important that we develop a theory of how arguments and conflicts are understood.Despite the many different approaches to argument and conflict resolution, a theory of argument understanding has not been well formulated. When argumentative understanding has been investigated, it has been considered primarily within a framework in which arguers are thought to be biased, irrational, or lacking in the logical or formal abilities needed to pursue and understand disagreements between people (Bazerman, 1986; Kuhn, 1991). Our theory of argumentation is different from most approaches because it assumes that arguers experience a clarity of attention during a dispute, undertake goal-directed action to resolve a disagreement, and possess an ability to understand and respond to the dialogic content that is generated during negotiation. Two dimensions particularly characterize our theory and set it apart from traditional approaches to argument and conflict resolution (eg, Toulmin, 1958). First, we believe that arguers always understand a dispute within the context of their personal and interpersonal goals.

During reading, the successful comprehender connects the various events, persons, and objects that he or she encounters so that the text appears to be a coherent whole rather than a random list of facts and events. Frequently, the relations between parts of a text are implicit and, therefore, must be inferred. If all goes well, the result of inferential processing is a mental rep resentation of the text that is relatively stable and that can be accessed at a later point in time to answer questions, retell the story, and so forth.

24820,"In the age of the intelligent machine, training of humans inevitably requires training for transfer. If we knew exactly what a person should do in a situation, we could program a computer or robot to do it instead. However, no two situations are exactly the same so uncertainty and differences arise in matches between the current situation and episodes of the past. Modeling transfer has traditionally meant getting as close as possible to modeling the total expertise trainees were expected to have in handling episodes of the past and future.

One possibility is to model knowledge (general or specific) that would permit a person to represent a situation in a form that can be handled by diverse training and transfer trajectories. A second possibility would be to establish a principled way to prioritize which knowledge should be overlearned so that it can be “stretched” to novel situations not covered in training.

24823,"Discourse comprehension is viewed from a multilevel framework that includes the levels of words, syntax, textbase, situation model, rhetorical structure, genre, and pragmatic communication. Discourse researchers investigate the cognitive representation of these levels and the process of constructing them during comprehension. Comprehension frequently is successful at all levels, but sometimes there are communication misalignments, information gaps, ungrounded symbols, and other comprehension obstacles that increase processing time or that lead to comprehension breakdowns. Psychologists have developed a number of psychological models of discourse comprehension, such as the the construction-integration, constructionist, and indexical-embodiment models. Advances in corpus and computational linguistics have allowed interdisciplinary researchers to systematically analyze the words, syntax, semantics, cohesion, situation model, world knowledge, and global structure of texts with computers. These computer analyses help researchers discover new discourse patterns, test hypotheses more rigorously, assess potential confounding variables, and scale texts on difficulty.",Arthur C Graesser and Carol M Forsyth,0,,The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Psychology,,475,Oxford University Press,30 Discourse Comprehension,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ktFMAgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA475&dq=info:vP4ccBIvBNMJ:scholar.google.com&ots=TeIxWYQn7Q&sig=Mf-UlmrCyqAG9YY65oNi-5MzozQ,,2013,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:jtI9f0ekYq0C
24824,"Research on cognitive maps has shown that Gestalt grouping and simplification processes are at work when building spatial representations. Recent studies in perceiving and judging event temporal relations have provided some evidence that people perform grouping by imposing boundaries on the incoming influx of simultaneous activities, and that the coterminous span is perceived as one discrete event following and/or being followed by events unfolding along a single track (ie, one agent and one goal at a time). The current study investigated the Gestalt grouping and simplification that readers bring to the comprehension of text when they think about the mental representations of the events being depicted in the text. The participants read pairs of actions described in sentences and judged the temporal relations by performing a seven-alternative forced choice task and a drawing task.

24838,"The ubiquity of hypermedia learning environments poses several challenges for researchers and educators. Learning with these non-linear, mutli-representational, open-ended learning environments typically involves the use of numerous metacognitive and self-regulatory processes such as planning, knowledge activation, metacognitive monitoring and regulation, and reflection (Azevedo, 2008, 2009; Greene & Azevedo, 2009; Moos & Azevedo, 2008; Schraw, 2007; Veenman, 2007; Winne & Hadwin, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008). Unfortunately, learners do not always regulate these processes when learning with hypermedia. As such, learners’ failure to regulate limits the instructional effectiveness of these environments to enhance learning about complex and challenging topics. In this chapter we will describe how we have used hypermedia environments to assess learners’ self-regulated learning (SRL).

24841,"In the first part of our talk we will briefly recall some general findings supporting the idea that some preposed adverbials can index one or several sentences following their host sentence. We will show that, owing to this characteristic, these adverbials–which we call framing adverbials–can assume specific organisational functions at the discourse level. Consequently, they must be considered as discourse-relational markers, comparable to anaphors and connectives. We will then examine the modern uses of the adverb parallèlement ‘in a parallel way’, and of the prepositional phrases (PPs) par ailleurs ‘(lit.) by elsewhere→ besides’ and d'ailleurs ‘(lit.) from elsewhere→ by the way’which originally have similar spatial contents. The last part of our talk will be devoted to en effet ‘indeed’in Old and Modern French.The question we address in this presentation is how extrapredicative adverbs and PPs can acquire framing functions and eventually–for some of them–become connectives. This trend is even more puzzling, from a linguistic point of view, given the fact that framing adverbials have forward discourse scope, while connectives have backward discourse scope. This development, as will be shown, seems conditioned by the transition to a stage where adverbials become anaphoric.",W Vonk and LGMM Hustinx and WHG Simons and RA Zwaan and MC Langston and AC Graesser,0,,Book of Abstracts/Résumés des communications,,14,,"From FRAMING adverbials to connectives Michel Charolles, Benjamin Fagard, Laure Sarda",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.455.2237&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=16,22,2009,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:2v_ZtQDX9iAC

24843,"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) are highly effective in supporting student learning, but are difficult to build. The Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) project started over 6 years ago with the goals of making it easier for experienced programmers, and possible for non-programmers to create an ITS. CTAT supports tutor building through programming by demonstration, an approach that has been successful in a range of application areas, but that has been applied to only a very limited degree to ITS authoring. Using CTAT, an author creates a tutor by demonstrating correct and incorrect problem solving behaviors, rather than by writing code. The resulting tutors, called exampletracing tutors, evaluate student behavior by flexibly comparing it against the demonstrated problem-solving examples. A key question is whether programming-by-demonstration can support sophisticated tutor behavior. We illustrate that example-tracing tutors are capable of sophisticated tutoring behaviors, going well beyond VanLehn’s (2006) minimum criterion for ITS status. They provide step-by-step guidance on complex problems while recognizing multiple student strategies and maintaining multiple interpretations of student behavior when there is ambiguity. Example-tracing tutors have been built and used in real educational settings for a wide range of application areas. Development time estimates from these projects indicate that CTAT improves the cost-effectiveness of ITS development by a factor of 48, compared to historical estimates.Although there is a lot of variability in these kinds of estimates, they nevertheless support our hope that lowering the skill …",Vincent Aleven and Eugene C Freuder and Arthur C Graesser and James Pustejovsky and Jan Wiebe,0,,,,,,Invited Talks,https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/43f9/e714d852c75a642db92aa854de485ca69f2d.pdf,,2009,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:unp9ATQDT5gC

24853,"How can the cognitive science community take what they have learned from decades of laboratory research and make it useful to shaping instruction as it occurs in school? This question has been of interest over the past thirty years (eg, Carver & Klahr, 2001), but much of what has been learned by cognitive scientists continues to remain within the cognition community and is not widely applied to student learning in the classroom. The papers presented in this symposium provide cutting-edge examples of research that build on systematic cognitive science research, and are being tested with children in school settings. The talks describe how iterative laboratory and classroom research efforts move our understanding of learning and instruction forward. The symposium papers examine how to use what cognitive science has learned about meta-cognition, spacing, deep explanations, and interactive adaptive tutoring in order to support learning in school-aged students.

24857,"The relationship between emotions and learning was investigated by tracking the affective states that college students experienced while interacting with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. An emotionally responsive tutor would presumably facilitate learning, but this would only occur if learner emotions can be accurately identified. After a learning session with AutoTutor, the affective states of the learner were classified by the learner, a peer, and judges trained on Ekman’s Facial Action Coding system. The classification of the trained judges was more reliable and matched the learners much better than the low scores of untrained peers. This result suggests that peer tutors may be limited in detecting the affective states of peer learners. Classification accuracy was poor at constant intervals of polling (every 20 seconds) but much higher when individuals declared that an affect state had been experienced.",Patrick Chipman and Sidney K D'Mello and Barry Gholson and Art Graesser and Bethany McDaniel and Amy Witherspoon,0,,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society,28,,,Detection of Emotions during Learning with AutoTutor,https://escholarship.org/content/qt2tb300fm/qt2tb300fm.pdf,28,2006,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:dhpJJ7xvgBgC

One can hope that this handbook will help clear up confusion for those who are still uncertain about what discourse processes are. And for those to whom the topic is familiar, this handbook will serve as a roadmap regarding where the field is going.

Important factors of LSA influence the generation of high quality LSA space including the size of the corpus, the weight (local or global) functions, number of dimensions to keep, etc. These factors are often difficult to determine and as a result hard to control for.

We randomly assigned 132 college students to one of three conditions: AutoTutor without simulations, AutoTutor with simulations, and a Monte Carlo AutoTutor that randomly generated dialogue moves. A pretest-posttest design was used to measure learning gains, as measured by objective multiple choice questions. All versions of AutoTutor were successful in promoting learning. The Monte Carlo AutoTutor produced significantly lower gains than the interactive simulation version for higher knowledge learners, and the direction of the three means were in the predicted direction.

24867,"Perhaps we should start with some questions. What do you need to learn to understand the title of this chapter? What does “processing coherence relations” mean? Why should a teacher, let alone a student, care about co-herence? We care about coherence because we believe, based on years of research, that processing coherence relations is a cornerstone of comprehension. Coherence breaks down when there are gaps in the text and the reader has trouble handling them. The text is less coherent when there are many conceptual and structural gaps in the text and the reader does not possess the knowledge to fill them. At the other end of the continuum, the text is progressively more coherent to the extent that there are few gaps and the reader has the prerequisite knowledge. This chapter identifies the specific cues or characteristics of text that fortify coherence. Our research, and that of many others, has pointed to various properties of the text as one important foundation for improving readers’ comprehension.

24868,"Researchers became interested in discourse when they became dissatisfied with the sentence or utterance as the unit of analysis in their investigations of language. It is quite correct that printed texts consist of a sequence of sentences, and that oral conversations consist, more or less, of a sequence of spoken utterances. However, discourse cannot be entirely reduced to sentences and utterances. Discourse has a context, cohesion, coherence, and rhetorical structure that weaves together and transcends the sentences/utterances. The context includes the participants in the acts of communication (speaker, listener, overhearer, reader, writer, narrator, narratee), the communication setting and goals, the pragmatic ground rules, the subject matter knowledge, and a host of other components that situate the discourse event (see chapter by Grimshaw).

By contrast, an exotropic theory is not confined within the bounds of its object of study. Rather, it is cosmoramic, typically embedding its central problematic in a context where the processes of its maintenance and change originate in its interaction with other universes of experience. From this point of view, the object of study in an exotropic theory is a component of what Lemke (1984, 1993) calls a “dynamic open system,” changing and being changed by its reciprocal engagement with the other components of the larger system.(p. 13)I locate discussions of narrative discourse at the intersection of a broad range of exotropic theories concerned with narrative on the one hand and discourse on the other.

ETAT follows 3 steps: segmentation of a text into nodes, classification of the unidentified nodes, and linking the nodes with relational arcs. ETAT automatically constructs a graph in the form of nodes and their interrelationships, along with various attendant statistics and information about non-interrelated, isolated nodes.

24883,"The fundamental challenge of personnel management in the military is to assign the right person to the right job at the right time. This process is traditionally broken down into problems of recruitment, selection, classification, and retention of soldiers. The workshop on “Military Psychology in Personnel Management” explored how these problems are handled in different countries and how science and technology can facilitate the process. Participants in the workshop expressed interest in collaborative projects between nations.Personnel management in the military has traditionally has been subdivided into the problems of recruitment, selection, classification, and retention. Soldiers are recruited through advertisements, through interactions between recruiters and prospective soldiers, and sometimes by government policies. Prospective soldiers are selected if they meet some set of standards, such as minimum cut-off scores on tests. Soldiers are classified to jobs and billets by matching the their profile of test scores, histories, and interests to the minimum requirements of the jobs/billets. And finally, soldiers are retained if there is a sufficient amount of incentives and stimulation to keep the soldier interested in a military career. The above four problems become progressively more challenging to the extent that there is a demand for more jobs and there is competition from other enterprises. For example, when the economy is extremely good, individuals find it much more attractive to work in business and industry instead of the military. It becomes extremely difficult to fill jobs in high technology and medicine when the salaries are doubled or tripled in the …",Arthur C Graesser,0,,This work relates to Department of the Navy Grant N00014-00-1-1086 issued by Office of Naval Research International Field Office.

Rather, understanding is achieved when readers are able to activate and apply their text-appropriate world knowledge in order to generate inferences regarding what the text is about. Furthermore, readers use their world knowledge in order to infer how elements of a text are related, and thus ensure that their mental representation of the text is coherent. Although there is consensus among discourse-processing researchers regarding the importance of world knowledge in understanding and achieving text coherence, there has been considerable theoretical conjecture and empirical research regarding what kinds of knowledge-based inferences readers normally generate during comprehension (Graesser, Singer, & Trabasso, 1994; Magliano & Graesser, 1991; McKoon & Ratcliff, 1992).

24890,"Over the past 25 years, research on text comprehension and production has evolved along separate paths and theoretical perspectives. However, there recently have been attempts to integrate the processes of comprehension and writing. This chapter addresses the links between the reading and writing of narratives in children.Text comprehension research has been blessed with a wealth of empirical studies and theoretical elaboration. The research was initially inspired by Kintsch’s psychological models in the mid-1970s (Kintsch, 1974; Kintsch & van Dijk, 1978), and has blossomed during the 1980s and 1990s (Britton & Graesser, 1996; Gernsbacher, 1994; Graesser, Gernsbacher, & Goldman, 1997; Graesser, Millis, & Zwaan, 1997; van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983; Weaver, Mannes, & Fletcher, 1995). Text comprehension is now viewed as a complex process that coordinates multiple levels of text representation, including the surface code (ie, wording and syntax), the rhetorical structure, the referential situation model (what the text is about), and the pragmatic communication between speaker/author and listener/reader. In-vestigations of narrative comprehension serve as an excellent example of the dynamics between empirical studies and theoretical elaboration.

Basic skills (such as decoding and syntactic analysis), access to semantic and episodic memory, attention and working memory, reasoning, and knowledge of reading strategies all need to come together for reading comprehension to be successful.

24902,"When people comprehend discourse, the speech or printed messages are not merely copied into their minds. Instead, the human mind actively constructs various types of cognitive representations (that is, codes, features, meanings, structured sets of elements) that interpret the linguistic input. These cognitive representations may incorporate words, syntax, sentential semantics, speech acts, dialogue patterns, rhetorical structures, pragmatics, real and imaginary worlds, and many other levels discussed in this volume. Each type of cognitive representation is functionally important during the processes of comprehending and producing text and talk. During the last 25 years, cognitive psychologists have explored how the human mind represents the information in various types of cognitive representations. Cognitive psychologists have discovered that some of these cognitive representations are not equivalent to the symbolic representations that have been proposed by many formal linguists, logicians, and computer scientists. For example, suppose that a husband and wife are in the middle of a heated argument and the wife dramatically exclaims,'If you don't leave, my clothes are going to Boston!'A traditional logician would construct a'truth table'that specifies the truth values of all combinations of the husband's leaving versus not leaving, and of the clothes going versus not going to Boston.

Cognitive psychologists once believed that reasoning consisted of the application of context-free rules to content-free symbolic expressions. Syllogisms constituted one of the paradigmatic examples of such reasoning. Researchers investigated the extent to whch the solutions to syllogisms conformed to truth tables, propositional calculus, and predicate calculus. It did not matter what the symbolic expressions meant or what they referred to because the essence of reasoning lay in the proper application of rules that were simple, well-formed, and universally valid.

24918,"Some of our knowledge about particular concepts is acquired by active inquiry in the form of question asking and answering. For example, suppose that a group of adults were having a conversation about music and someone mentioned the term oboe. Adults unacquainted with the concept of oboe might ask a series of questions in order to fill gaps in their knowledge base. They might begin by asking,“What does oboe mean?”“What does an oboe look like?” or “What does an oboe sound like?” The more knowledgeable adults might ask esoteric questions, such as “What causes an oboe to have such a nasal sound?” or “How can an oboe player prevent the sound from going flat?” The content and representation of a particular concept presumably is to some extent determined by active inquiry. Active inquiry is manifested in a variety of behavioral and cognitive activities. The most obvious form of active inquiry consists of verbal question asking and answering. Search behavior is another obvious manifestation of active inquiry. When a person searches a house for a set of lost keys, for example, the underlying question that motivates the person's actions is,“Where are the keys?” The process of problem-solving may be construed as a form of inquiry in the sense that the problem-solver implic-",Mark C Langston,0,,Categorization by Humans and Machines: Advances in Research and Theory,,411,Academic Press,ASKING QUESTIONS,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=G-gYMjkNXYYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA411&dq=info:lIHiv0hZ4kUJ:scholar.google.com&ots=37Wxcrwo0M&sig=4XZWqL18dx24e1SKwoxe8Qwz1Us,29,1993,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:pyW8ca7W8N0C

24920,"One-to-one tutoring is more effective than alternative training methods, yet there have been few attempts to examine the process of naturalistic tutoring. This project explored dialogue patterns in two corpora: graduate students tutoring undergraduates in research methods, and high school students tutoring 7th graders in algebra. We analyzed pedagogical strategies. feedback mechanisms, question asking, question answering, and pragmatic assumptions during the tutoring process. One pervasive dialogue pattern was a five-step frame:(I) tutor asks question,(2) student answers question.(3) tutor gives short feedback on answer quality,(4) tutor and student collaboratively improve on answer quality, and (5) tutor assesses the student's understanding of the answer. Tutor questions were primarily motivated by curriculum scripts and the process of coaching students through exemplar problems--rarely by attempts to diagnose and remediate the student's idiosyncratic knowledge deficits.Dialogue patterns were simulated by two computational models: a recurrent connectionist network and a recursive transition network.

24933,"Creativity has been one of the most difficult human faculties to investigate systematically. Nearly everyone has a favorite story that illustrates how a creative solution to a difficult problem seemed to emerge from a chaotically organized assortment of clues, all of which seemed to defy systematicity. In the context of science, philosophers have essentially abandoned the unruly problem of creativity. McGuire (Chapter 8) aptly points out, for example, that the problem of verifying (testing) the validity of a scientific hypothesis has received intense philosophical inquiry and is perhaps overemphasized in scientific methods courses. In contrast, the problem of discovering or gen-erating a scientific hypothesis involves creative processes which have generally been outside of the provinces of philosophy and methods courses. Fortunately, there are some who have attempted to understand creativity in science. Historians, for example, have documented some of the creative processes and accomplishments of famous scientists. Sociologists have identified social, political, and cultural forces that either encourage or discourage creativity. Creativity has been a direct object of inquiry in psychology for at least a century. Consequently, psychologists have identified some of the reg-ularities and mechanisms that underly the creative process. The three chapters in this section (by Simonton, McGuire, and Gruber) represent some of psy-chology's recent contributions. It would not be surprising if psychology were to take a leadership role in the interdisciplinary metascience arena when it comes to identifying creative processes in science.

24949,"This chapter explores the symbolic procedures that humans execute when they answer complex questions. Complex questions invite elaborate verbal descriptions. For example, we could ask a number of complex questions about President Reagan cutting the research budget: Why did Reagan cut the budget? How did Reagan cut the budget? What enabled Reagan to cut the budget? What is the consequence of Reagan’s cutting the budget? When did Reagan cut the budget? Where did Reagan cut the budget? and What is the signiﬁcance of Reagan’s cutting the budget? These complex questions may be contrasted with simple questions that involve discrete or continuous judgments on some dimension. For example, simple questions include truth veriﬁcation questions and “rating scale” type questions: Did Reagan cut the research budget? and How much do you like Reagans cutting the budget? Psychologists know very little about the symbolic procedures of complex questions. Psychologists have vigorously investigated simple questions during the last two decades (Clark & Clark, 1977; Collins & Loftus, 1975; Collins & Quillian, 1969; Kintsch, 1974; McCloskey & Glucksberg, 1979; Reder, I982; Singer, 1980; Smith & Medin, 1981; Smith, Shoben, & Rips, 1974).

24953,"The regression equation is one of the informative products of a multiple regression analysis. In our application, the regression equation generates a set of predicted sentence reading times that optimally match the obtained reading times. There is a slope coefficient for each predictor variable in the regression equation. We were particularly interested in these slope coefficients because they estimate the processing time that is uniquely associated with specific predictor variables. Multiple regression analyses were also performed on the reading times of individual readers, resulting in a profile of slope coefficients for each reader. We could ultimately compare the profiles of different readers. Most researchers believe that comprehension is somehow related to the way readers allocate their cognitive resources to different text components during reading. At this point in the science, however, researchers understand very little about the relationship between resource allocation and comprehension (see Reynolds & Anderson, 1981). In order to investigate this relationship, we administered a comprehension test on the passages after the subjects read them. The readers' comprehension scores were ultimately correlated with the slope coefficients of the reading time regression equations. These analyses provided some informative clues as to why some readers have poor comprehension of what they read. Thus, the profile of slope coefficients for individual readers are useful in the sense that they can predict and diagnose comprehension problems.",Arthur C Graesser and James R Riha,0,,"New Methods in Reading Comprehension Research:[papers Presented at a Conference at the University of Arizona, Dec. 10-11, 1981]",,183,Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc Incorporated,OVERVIEW OF METHODOLOGY,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8981935565304156881&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1984,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:eAlLMO4JVmQC

24978,"The Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) provides standardized ways to build high performance intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). The authoring tools in GIFT allow authors to create highly interactive learning content that adapts to learners’ individual characteristics (Cai, Graesser, & Hu, 2015). However, developing authoring tools for authors to create systems that can be self-improving is still a challenging problem.For over four decades, researchers have been trying to develop computer tutoring systems that could be as effective as professional human tutors (Smith & Sherwood, 1976). The effectiveness of tutoring, either human tutoring or computer tutoring, is usually measured by the relative effect size compared to conventional instructional activities without tutoring. The effect size of professional human tutoring was once expected to be 2.0 (Bloom, 1984), whereas untrained human tutoring and computer tutoring is approximately 0.8 (VanLehn, 2011). The tutoring process is a sequence of interactions between a tutor and an individual student. An effective tutor should be able to guide the student to go through a path that is relatively short, if not the shortest, in a learning process. The tutor helps a student in each step of the learning process by recommending learning content, giving immediate feedback and hints, providing and explaining ideal solutions, correcting misconceptions and answering questions (Graesser, Hu, & Sottilare, 2018).

24979,"A fundamental approach to developing self-improving intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is to have different sources of assessment on the quality of the decisions, solutions and algorithms. The sources of assessment can be categorized in various ways, but we identify the major categories as being theoretical models, computational algorithms, human judgments, and empirical performance. Quality is high on the theoretical model front when an implementation (ie, decision, solution, algorithm, or entire system) is compatible with the features of a theory, model, or hypotheses that is widely accepted in scientific research and practice. The quality of a computational algorithm increases to the extent that implementation is fast, efficient, complete, general, interoperable, and so on. There are different stakeholders who can provide human judgments of an implementation: learners, instructors, learning engineers, researchers, and supervisors. Empirical performance includes learning gains, engagement, and other psychological measures that can be objectively measured and that validate the success of an implementation.The main point of this chapter is to make the case that all sources of assessment have limitations that designers of self-improving intelligent tutoring systems (SI-ITSs) need to consider. There is no perfect gold standard. Designers bicker endlessly on which theoretical model to adopt and on the adequacy of a computational algorithm. Humans disagree in their judgments and typically rely on simple cognitive heuristics when making judgments and decisions. Many would agree that empirical performance should be high in the priority of …",Arthur C Graesser and Jeanine A DeFalco and Jody L Cockroft,0,,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,169,,"–SIMPLE HUMANS, EVOLVING COMPUTATION, SMART INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS",https://tradem.gifttutoring.org/attachments/download/3410/DesignRecommendationsforITS_Volume7_SelfImprovingSystemsBook.pdf#page=177,,,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:wE8AsS3ykUMC

24981,"This paper describes two affect-sensitive variants of an existing intelligent tutoring system called AutoTutor. The new versions of AutoTutor detect learners’ boredom, confusion, and frustration by monitoring conversational cues, gross body language, and facial features. The sensed cognitive-affective states are used to select AutoTutor’s pedagogical and motivational dialogue moves and to drive the behavior of an embodied pedagogical agent that expresses emotions through verbal content, facial expressions, and affective speech. The first version, called the Supportive AutoTutor, addresses the presence of the negative states by providing empathetic and encouraging responses. The Supportive AutoTutor attributes the source of the learners’ emotions to the material or itself, but never directly to the learner. In contrast, the second version, called the Shakeup AutoTutor, takes students to task by directly attributing the source of the emotions to the learners themselves and responding with witty, skeptical, and enthusiastic responses.

On one hand Operation ARIES! is an educational tool that was developed by experts in the learning sciences, but on the other hand it is a fantasy game with a science-fiction plot and students compete against other players using the knowledge they learn. Operation ARIES! was designed for advanced high school students, undergraduate university and college students, and soldiers in the military. Students learn the material by engaging in interactive conversations with agents that adapt to their skill level, by applying the acquired knowledge in critiques of ecologically valid case studies, and by generating their own questions about incomplete research while interrogating suspected alien scientists.The game can be adopted and implemented by educators in various ways. First, it is appropriate for introductory courses in science (eg, psychology, biology, and chemistry), critical thinking, and research methods. Second, students can complete Operation ARIES! in 15-25 hours as an in-class activity, as a homework assignment, or combination of the two. Third, because the game includes different modules or levels, it is possible for educators to pick and choose which will be most applicable to their needs.

24989,"AutoTutor is a type of intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that uses natural language conversation to help students learn (Graesser, 2016; Graesser, Forsyth & Foltz, 2016; Graesser, Person, Harter & Tutoring Research Group, 2001; Zapata-Rivera, Jackson & Katz, 2015). In a traditional classroom learning environment, a teacher delivers knowledge to a group of students in a linear way. That is, all students in the class follow the same learning path as the teacher plans. Computer tutoring makes it possible to allow each student to go through one’s own learning path that maximizes learning and minimizes the cost. ITSs are designed to meet these objectives (Sottilare, Graesser, Hu & Goldberg, 2014).ITSs are capable of adaptively selecting learning objects to deliver to an individual learner. The selection mechanism is basically a mapping from learning objects to learners’ profiles. In this chapter, learning objects refer to digital entities that may be used for learning, education, or training. They could be of very different grain sizes. A learning object could be as large as an entire knowledge domain, such as mathematics, psychology, music, science, etc. A learning object could be as small as a single step in the process of solving a problem. To match learning objects with learners’ profiles at a specific point of a learning process, there have to be computable measures that sufficiently characterize learning objects and learners.",Zhiqiang Cai and Arthur C Graesser and Xiangen Hu and Bor-chen Kuo,0,,Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems,,309,,–Assessment in AutoTutor,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Sottilare/publication/319330321_Design_Recommendations_for_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_Volume_5_-_Assessment_Methods/links/59a55beb458515a339332fc1/Design-Recommendations-for-Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems-Volume-5-Assessment-Methods.pdf#page=317,,,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:UKB2i6g6GNMC

In that book, he made a number of astute observations on frowns, the contexts that elicit them, their evolutionary value, their special status in the arsenal of human expressions, and their ubiquity as a form of emotional expression from infancy to mortality. Darwin observed that frowns often accompanied incongruence during deep thought and effortful deliberation, but not during simple reflection, orientation of attention, or meditation. He reasoned that frowns were an expressive correlate of the intention to focus attention on distant objects, which can be achieved by contracting the eye muscles so as to restrict incoming light to objects of immediate relevance. Though once associated with voluntary muscle control in the service of visual perception, Darwin hypothesized that through millions of years of evolution, the frown was involuntarily associated with information seeking, as is the case when one encounters a disruption in a train of thought. Although not explicitly mentioned by Darwin, in some contexts, the furrowed brow is accompanied by feelings of cognitive disequilibrium (Piaget, 1952), or cognitive",Sidney K D’Mello and Arthur C Graesser,0,,,,,,University of Notre Dame and University of Memphis,https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/TopicsInCognitiveScience/DMelloConfusion-Reprint.pdf,,,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:ZysSsiWj_g4C

25005,"Previous research on inference generation has focused primarily on narrative text (eg, stories, scripts, fables) rather than expository text (eg, encyclopedia articles, textbooks). This is not surprising in light of the fact that more knowledge—based inferences are generated in narrative prose (Graesser, 1981). Writers of narratives rely to a great extent on the shared knowledge between writer and readers because the primary func-tion of narrative text is to entertain the reader with characters who perform actions in a ﬁctive world. In contrast, the primary function of expository text is to convey new information about a topic to the reader. Since the information is new, the writer attempts to capture important material explicitly (Britton & Black, 1984). Expository texts seem dry in com-parison, but their importance is obvious when one considers their impact on education and everyday life.

25018,"There are many aspects of human-human learning interactions that can contribute to an assessment of a student’s knowledge and ability level. The equations and diagrams the student creates while solving a problem are just one type of interaction language that can influence an evaluation of the student. Questions and comments that the student produces during the problem solving while deciding what equations and diagrams to generate, and the student’s responses to questions and guidance, can be revealing as well. In learning systems, however, student assessment has been primarily limited to interpreting equation and diagram manipulations, and the timing and type of help requests a student makes relative to a menu of available help.Many efforts are under way to increase the ways in which students can communicate with a learning environment. One area of exploration is the addition of both spoken and written natural language understanding and generation capabilities to equation and diagram manipulation interfaces. Mixing natural language with algebraic and graphical forms of communication demonstrates that each cannot be analyzed completely separately and then combined, since each can influence the analysis of the others. For example, an explicit or implicit presence of equations, diagrams, and formal domain concepts can heavily influence the content and form of the natural language used by the student and the system, and vice versa, so that the natural language used may",Pamela W Jordan and Maxim Makatchev and Peter Wiemer-Hastings and Bert Bredeweg and Vania Dimitrova and Brad Goodman and Art Graesser and Helmut Horacek and Ivana Kruijff-Korbayová and H Chad Lane and Chas Murray and Carolyn Rosé,0,,,,,,Workshop scientific committee,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.101.573&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:Y9VhQm-5nPIC

One problem addresses statistical properties of an LSA space when it is used as a measure of similarity, while the second problem addresses the limited use of dimensional information in the vector representation. With respect to the statistical aspect of LSA, we propose using the standardized value of cosine matches for similarity measurements between documents. Such standardization is based on both the statistical properties of the LSA space and the properties of the specific application. With respect to the dimensional information in LSA vectors, we propose three different methods of using LSA vectors in computing similarity between documents. The three methods adapt to (1) learner perspective,(2) context, and (3) conversational history.

When the text is in the narrative genre, such as a simple story, the situation model is a mental microworld of events and actions, with characters performing actions in the pursuit of goals, events that present obstacles to the goals, conflicts between characters, methods of resolving conflicts, and emotional reactions to the events and conflicts. If the reader has sufficient time and motivation, the mental microworld can have quite vivid elaborations that flesh out details of the spatial setting, the style and procedure of actions, and the properties of objects that characters use. There may also be content that refers to mental states of characters (what they believe, know, perceive, and want). Mental models are created from information in the text as well as knowledge of the reader. It is comparatively easy for adults to construct situation models for narrative texts because the microworlds have a close correspondence to everyday experiences. In contrast, it is more difficult to construct a situation model for informational texts, such as an expository text on a scientific mechanism. Ideally, the reader would be able to construct a mental model of the components, causal chains, and processes that capture a scientific mechanism.

25042,"Instruction Based on Tutoring Tutoring is the typical solution that students, parents, teachers, principles and school systems turn to when the students are not achieving expected grades and educational standards. There are serious worries in the community when a school is not meeting the standards of a high stakes test, and teachers are anxious about the prospects of losing their jobs due to the criteria and policies of No Child Left Behind. Schools and families worry when a student runs the risk of losing a scholarship or when an athlete may be cut from a team. Tutors step in to help under these conditions. Wealthier families might end up paying $200 per hour for an accomplished tutor to rescue save a son or daughter. However, these expectations may be rather high, considering that most tutors are same-age peers of the students, slightly older cross-age tutors, citizens in the community, and paraprofessionals who have had little or no training on tutoring pedagogy. Nevertheless, their tutoring can be effective in helping students learn, as we will document in this chapter.Although most tutors in school systems have little or no tutoring training, there are many examples of excellent tutoring programs that are grounded in the science of learning. One notable example is the Reciprocal Teaching method that helps students learn how to read text at deeper levels (Palincsar & Brown, 1984, 1988). The tutoring method engages the tutor and students in a dialogue that jointly constructs the meaning of the text. The dialogue is supported with the use of four strategies: generating questions, summarizing text segments, clarifying unfamiliar words and …",Arthur C Graesser,0,,,,,,"Graesser, AC, Olney, A., Cade, W.(2009).

25043,"Commentary on Causal Prescriptive Statements Causal prescriptive statements are necessary in the social sciences whenever there is a mission to help individuals, groups, or organizations improve. Researchers inquire whether some variable or intervention A causes an improvement in some mental, emotional, or behavioural variable B. If they are satisfied that A causes B, then they can take steps to manipulate A in the real world and thereby help people by enhancing B. It is this utility in helping people that makes it imperative to test causal prescriptive statements with rigorous methodology and to rule out extraneous third variables and confounding variables as being the true cause instead of variable A. Aside from the utility of helping people, tests of causal prescriptive statements are important for advancing scientific theories of the mechanisms that underlie cognition, emotion, and behaviour. Causal statements are not essential for advancing all sciences. Astronomy and some areas of physics are essentially descriptive so researchers are not obsessed with questions of causality. Nevertheless, rigorous tests of causal statements are always a welcome addition to a science.Consider an example with no relevance to educational psychology. Most of us have had the experience of our automobile engine breaking down, hopefully not on a dangerous highway. Who would be the best person to help us in this situation?

However, sometimes the tutor is a peer of the tutee who plays the role of a tutor, even though the tutor and tutee are at approximately the same level of subject matter mastery.

Theoretical bases exist for three contrasting hypotheses. The speech facilitation hypothesis predicts that spoken input will increase learning, whereas the text facilitation hypothesis predicts typed input will be superior. The modality equivalence hypothesis claims that learning gains will be equivalent. Previous experiments that tested these hypotheses were confounded by automated speech recognition systems with substantial error rates that were detected by learners. We addressed this concern in two experiments via a Wizard of Oz procedure, where a human intercepted the learner’s speech and transcribed the utterances before submitting them to the tutor. The overall pattern of the results supported the following conclusions:(a) learning gains associated with spoken and typed input were on par and quantitatively higher than a nointervention control,(b) participants’ evaluations of the session were not influenced by modality, and (c) there were no modality effects associated with differences in prior knowledge and typing proficiency.

25062,"The paper presents a study in which participants learned computer literacy by having a spoken conversation with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. Thirty students completed a multiple-choice pre-test, a 35-minute training session, and a multiple-choice post-test. After completing the post-test, students reviewed their tutorial interaction and judged what emotions they experienced on the basis of the dialogue history and their facial expressions. Our results revealed that many measures of performance were impervious to poor or modest speech recognition accuracy, which is compatible with a soft constraint-based model. Speech recognition errors had a very subtle impact on learning as well as participants’ emotions and attitudes.",Sidney K D’Mello and Brandon King and Michal Stolarski and Patrick Chipman and Arthur Graesser,0,,,,,,Speech and Language Technology in Education (SLaTE2007),https://www.isca-speech.org/archive_open/slate_2007/sle7_049.html,,,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C
25063,"読むという行為は主に現在読んでいる句や文を直前に読んだものと結びつけることである. そこには局所的な首尾一貫性が存在する. その首尾一貫性の成立には多くの要因が絡み, 多様な過程が必要である. 例えば, ある考えの重複, 因果関係や照応関係そして文間の意味関係などである. 首尾一貫性を明示的に成立させる言語標識としては numeral (first), sequence markers (next, finally), relevance indicators (in summary), logical connectives (and, therefore, but) が挙げられる. これらは読み手がテキスト内の文間の関係を築くのを促す機能を持っている.1.

25064,"The paper presents two studies where participants learned computer literacy by having a spoken conversation with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. In the first study 30 students completed a pre-test, a 35-minute training session, and a post-test. The results revealed that significant learning occurred despite considerable speech recognition errors. The second study utilized a repeated measures design where 23 participants completed a pre-test, a 3-part tutorial session (speech input, text input, no intervention), and a post-test. Learning gains for the speech and typed conditions were on par and significantly higher than the control. Speech recognition error rates were not correlated with learning. We address the implications of our findings for learning environments that support spoken student responses.",Sidney K D’Mello and Brandon King and Patrick Chipman O’Meed Entezari and Arthur Graesser,0,,,,,,Do You Understand Me?

25065,"PREG is a conceptual model of human question asking. The model contains a set of production rules that specify the conditions under which children and adults ask questions when they read expository texts. The essence of PREG’s question asking mechanism is the existence of discrepancies between the representation of text information and the reader’s world knowledge, with a mediating role of pragmatics and metacognition. Both the explicit text and the world knowledge are represented in the form of a conceptual graph structure. Comparisons between text representations and readers’ knowledge are carried out by examining the three components of conceptual graph structures: words, statements, and links between statements. Some of the predictions of PREG were tested on a corpus of questions generated by 8 th grade and 12 th grade students who read short scientific texts. These predictions were …",Arthur C Graesser,0,,,,,,PREG: Elements of a Model of Question Asking José Otero,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=325278174544304691&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,SA-2DGsAAAAJ:KaMxkj08jr0C
