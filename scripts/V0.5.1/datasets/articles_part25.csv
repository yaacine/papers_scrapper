25005,"This paper proposes a mechanism for equation-based congestion control for unicast traffic. Most best-effort traffic in the current Internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol, TCP. However, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time.

25012,"A number of large-scale distributed Internet applications could potentially benefit from some level of knowledge about the relative proximity between its participating host nodes. For example, the performance of large overlay networks could be improved if the application-level connectivity between the nodes in these networks is congruent with the underlying IP-level topology. Similarly, in the case of replicated Web content, client nodes could use topological information in selecting one of multiple available servers. For such applications, one need not find the optimal solution in order to achieve significant practical benefits. Thus, these applications, and presumably others like them, do not require exact topological information and can instead use sufficiently informative hints about the relative positions of Internet hosts.

In this paper, we propose an application-level multicast scheme capable of scaling to large group sizes without restrictingthe service model to a single source.

25021,"This paper investigates the current problems found with audio applications over the MBONE (Multi-cast Backbone Overlay)/Internet, and, based on preliminary studies, describes possible solutions. The authors describe how current audio applications work, and how this structure enables redundancy to be a viable solution to the problem of packet loss. The paper proposes the use of synthetic speech coding algorithms (vocoders) to provide redundancy; the algorithms produce a very low bit-rate stream, which used alone give very mechanical sounding speech. Preliminary experiments show that normal speech repaired with synthetic quality speech is intelligible, even for very high loss rates. The paper goes on to investigate how the redundancy might be included in an audio application for use over the Internet. The application of this work is multimedia conferencing over the Internet. The work is based on experiences in multi-way multimedia conferencing demonstrations from Project MICE (Multimedia Integrated Conferencing for Europe) (using the popular tool `vat'), Project ReLaTe (Remote Language Teaching over SuperJANET), and preliminary experiments.  Experience has shown that the major problem with the MBONE for audio is one of packet loss. Packet loss occurs for a number of reasons: when routers become congested, when packets arrive too late to be played back, or when scheduling difficulties in a multi-tasking operating system occur.

It dynamically allocates to domains multicast address ranges from which groups initiated in the domain get their multicast addresses.

The problem is one of adapting the compression without requiring video servers to reencode the data, and fitting the resulting stream into the rapidly varying available bandwidth. At the same time, rapid fluctuations in quality will be disturbing to the users and should be avoided. We present a mechanism for using layered video in the context of unicast congestion control. This quality adaptation mechanism adds and drops layers of the video stream to perform long-term coarse-grain adaptation, while using a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism to react to congestion on very short timescales.

25046,"Despite the success of proxy caching in the Web, proxy servers have not been used effectively for caching of Internet multimedia streams such as audio and video. Explosive growth in demand for web-based streaming applications justifies the need for caching popular streams at a proxy server close to the interested clients. Because of the need for congestion control in the Internet, multimedia streams should be quality adaptive. This implies that on a cache-hit, a proxy must replay a variable-quality cached stream whose quality is determined by the bandwidth of the first session. This paper addresses the implications of congestion control and quality adaptation on proxy caching mechanisms for streaming applications. We present a finegrain replacement algorithm for layered-encoded multimedia streams at Internet proxy servers, and describe a pre-fetching scheme to smooth out the variations in quality of a cached stream during subsequent playbacks. This enables the proxy to perform quality adaptation more effectively and maximizes the delivered quality. We also extend the semantics of popularity and introduce the idea of weighted hit to capture both the level of interest and the usefulness of a layer for a cached stream. Finally, we show that interaction between our replacement algorithm and pre-fetching results in the state of the cache converging to the optimal state such that the quality of a cached stream is proportional to its popularity, and the variations in quality of a cached stream are inversely proportional to its popularity. This implies that after serving several requests for a stream,",Reza Rejaie and Mark Handley and Haobo Yu and Deborah Estrin,174,2263962706954397326,Proc. 4th Int.

However, long periods when the sender is idle or application-limited can lead to the invalidation of the congestion window, in that the congestion window no longer reflects current information about the state of the network. In this paper we propose a simple modification to TCP’s congestion control algorithms to decay the congestion window cwnd after the transition from a sufficiently-long applicationlimited period, while using the slow-start threshold ssthresh to save information about the previous value of the congestion window.An invalid congestion window also results when the congestion window is increased (ie, in TCP’s slow-start or congestion avoidance phases) during application-limited periods, when the previous value of the congestion window might never have been fully utilized. We propose that the TCP sender should not increase the congestion window when the TCP sender has been application-limited (and therefore has not fully used the current congestion window).

We present Wedge, a system well suited to the splitting of complex, legacy, monolithic applications into fine-grained, least-privilege compartments. Wedge consists of two synergistic parts: OS primitives that create compartments with default-deny semantics, which force the programmer to make compartments' privileges explicit; and Crowbar, a pair of run-time analysis tools that assist the programmer in determining which code needs which privileges for which memory objects. By implementing the Wedge system atop Linux, and applying it to the SSL-enabled Apache web server and the OpenSSH login server, we demonstrate that Wedge allows fine-grained compartmentalization of applications to prevent the leakage of sensitive data, at acceptable performance cost.

25058,"Traditional multicast routing mechanisms (eg DVMRP and MOSPF 1, 2]) were intended for use within regions where groups are widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When group members, and senders to those group members, are distributed sparsely across a wide area, these schemes are not e cient; data packets or membership report information are periodically sent over many links that do not lead to receivers or senders, respectively. This characteristic lead the Internet community to investigate multicast routing architectures that e ciently establish distribution trees across wide-area internets, where many groups are sparsely represented and where bandwidth is not uniformly plentiful due to the distances and multiple administrations traversed. E ciency is evaluated in terms of the state, control message processing, and data packet processing required across the entire network in order to deliver data packets to the members of the group. The Protocol Independent Multicast {Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) architecture:(a) maintains the traditional IP multicast service model of receiver-initiated membership;(b) uses explicit joins that propagate hop-by-hop from members' directly connected routers toward the distribution tree.(c) builds a shared multicast distribution tree centered at a Rendezvous Point, and then builds source-speci c trees for those sources whose data tra c warrants it.(d) is not dependent on a speci c unicast routing protocol; and (e) uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying network conditions and group dynamics.",Stephen Deering and Deborah Estrin and Dino Farinacci and Mark Handley and Ahmed Helmy and Van Jacobson and Ching-gung Liu and Puneet Sharma and David Thaler and Liming Wei,136,9495074313119582792,,,1336837772.1524313230-747404841.1522487116,Proposed Experimental RFC,Protocol independent multicast-sparse mode (PIM-SM): motivation and architecture,https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~helmy/papers/PIM-Arch-2.pdf,,1996,/scholar?cites=9495074313119582792,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC

Members first join a multicast tree rooted at this rendezvous point in order to receive data packets sent to the group.

25071,"This paper proposes a mechanism for equation-based congestion control for unicast traffic. Most best-effort traffic in the current Internet is well-served by the dominant transport protocol TCP. However, traffic such as best-effort unicast streaming multimedia could find use for a TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism that refrains from reducing the sending rate in half in response to a single packet drop. With our mechanism, the sender explicitly adjusts its sending rate as a function of the measured rate of loss events, where a loss event consists of one or more packets dropped within a single round-trip time. We use both simulations and experiments over the Internet to explore performance. Equation-based congestion control is also a promising avenue of development for congestion control of multicast traffic, and so an additional reason for this work is to lay a sound basis for the later development of multicast congestion control.",Sally Floyd and Mark Handley and Jitendra Padhye and Jörg Widmer,98,4077850154280606278,Technical Reports,,,,Equation-based congestion control for unicast applications: the extended version,https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/768/,,2000,/scholar?cites=4077850154280606278,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC
25072,"Multipath transport protocols have the potential to greatly improve the performance and resilience of Internet traffic flows. The basic idea is that if flows are able to simultaneously use more than one path through the network, then they will be more resilient to problems on particular paths (eg transient problems on a radio interface), and they will be able to pool capacity across multiple links. These multiple paths might be obtained for example by sending from multiple interfaces, or sending to different IP addresses of the same host, or by some form of explicit path control.Multipath-capable flows should be designed so that they shift their traffic from congested paths to uncongested paths, so that the Internet will be better able to accommodate localized surges in traffic and use all available capacity. In effect, multipath congestion control means that the end systems take on a role that is normally associated with routing, namely moving traffic onto paths that avoid congestion hotspots, at least to whatever extent they can given the paths they have available. When a flow shifts its traffic onto less congested paths, then the loss rate on the less congested path will increase and that on the more congested path will decrease; the overall outcome with many multipath flows is that the loss rates across an interconnected network of paths will tend to equalize. This is a form of load balancing, or more generally resource pooling [14], described further in § 2.",Costin Raiciu and Damon Wischik and Mark Handley,97,9308730262172924372,"University College London, London/United Kingdom, Tech.

25090,"by Mark Handley, ACIRI and Jon Crowcroft, University College London hen you need to send data to many receivers simultaneously, you have two options: repeated transmission and broadcast. Repeated transmission may be acceptable if the cost is low enough and delivery can be spread out over time, as with junk mail or electronic mailing lists. Otherwise, a broadcast solution is required. With real-time multimedia, repeated delivery is feasible, but only at great expense to the sender, who must invest in large amounts of bandwidth. Similarly, traditional broadcast channels have been very expensive if they cover significant numbers of recipients or large geographic areas. However, the Internet offers an alternative solution: IP multicast effectively turns the Internet into a broadcast channel, but one that anyone can send to without having to spend huge amounts of money on transmitters and government licenses. It provides efficient, timely, and global many-to-many distribution of data, and as such may become the broadcast medium of choice in the future.The Internet is a datagram network, meaning that anyone can send a packet to a destination without having to preestablish a path. Of course, the boxes along the way must have either precomputed a set of paths, or they must be relatively fast at calculating one as needed, and typically, the former approach is used. However, the sending host need not be aware of or participate in the complex route calculation; nor does it need to take part in a complex signaling or call setup protocol. It simply addresses the packet to the right place, and sends it. This procedure may be a more complex procedure if …",Mark Handley and John Crowcroft,52,8594417874614343248,The Internet Protocol Journal,4,2-19,,Internet multicast today,http://www.pop-rs.rnp.br/~berthold/etcom/redes2-2000/artigos/ipj_2-4.pdf.gz,2,1999,/scholar?cites=8594417874614343248,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC

25117,"In this thesis I examine scaling aspects of IP-multicast based multimedia conferencing systems. The thesis is that application level semantics must be used in protocol design to cope with various forms of failure, and that these systems should be designed to permit inconsistencies in order to scale. I present an examination of the network conditions that such applications must face as motivation, and examine application designs for two aspects of multimedia conferencing as validation. These applications are a distributed shared editor and a distributed session directory. The general design principle of Application Level Framing (ALF) was applied during the design of these applications. I show that ALF can and should be applied in a wider context than that stated in the original ALF paper from Clark and Tennenhouse, and that it results in applications that perform well and are very robust to a wide variety of conditions. However it can also lead to designs that are difficult to generalise from. The design methodology of lightweight sessions as proposed by Van Jacobson and based on IP multicast presents a large design space in which very few points have been mapped.  This thesis explores some of this design space. In the chapter on shared editors, I examine the effects of designing for robustness and redundancy in shared tools, and conclude that solutions resulting from such design perform well but are very specific to the design task and cannot easily be abstracted.

25122,"By simultaneously using multiple paths through the Internet, multipath transport protocols have the potential to greatly improve performance, resilience and flexibility. Further, by linking the congestion behavior of the subflows of a connection, it is possible to move traffic away from congested paths, allowing network capacity to be pooled and better handling surges in traffic. In this paper we show that existing algorithms that achieve such resource pooling have a few problems, which stem from the differences between fluid flow models and packet-level behavior. Further, these algorithms are poor at detecting and using capacity when congestion levels vary rapidly, as they do in the Internet. We propose the principle of equipoise as a balance to resource pooling, and present a class of algorithms that achieve different degrees of resource pooling and equipoise. We show how to dynamically adapt the aggressiveness of multipath flows so they compete fairly in the current Internet. We use a combination of real deployment and packet-level simulation to show that the emergent behavior of these algorithms is robust, the algorithms are fair to existing TCP, and achieve both equipoise and resource pooling.",Damon Wischik and Costin Raiciu and Mark Handley,15,15304874616825518295,,,,,Balancing Resource Pooling and Equipoise in Multipath Transport,https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~djw1005/Research/ucl_research/mtcpa.pdf,,2010,/scholar?cites=15304874616825518295,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:bnK-pcrLprsC

25126,"WiFi's physical layer has increased in speed from 802.11 b's 11 Mbps to the Gbps rates of emerging 802.11 ac. Despite these gains, WiFi's inefficient MAC layer limits achievable end-to-end throughput. The culprit is 802.11's mandatory idle period before each medium acquisition, which has come to dwarf the duration of a packet's transmission. This overhead is especially punishing for TCP traffic, whose every two data packets elicit a short TCP ACK. Even frame aggregation and block link-layer ACKs (introduced in 802.11 n) leave significant medium acquisition overhead for TCP ACKs. In this paper, we propose TCP/HACK (Hierarchical ACKnowledgment), a system that applies cross-layer optimization to TCP traffic on WiFi networks by carrying TCP ACKs within WiFi's link-layer acknowledgments. By eliminating all medium acquisitions for TCP ACKs in unidirectional TCP flows, TCP/HACK significantly improves medium utilization, and thus significantly increases achievable capacity for TCP workloads.

The ISP's topology, routing, and traffic engineering, often over multiple paths, together determine congestion and latency within its backbone.

We introduce low-latency path diversity (LLPD), a metric that captures a topology's flexibility to accommodate traffic on alternative low-latency paths. We explore to what extent 116 real backbone topologies can, regardless of routing system, keep latency low when demand exceeds the shortest path's capacity.

25149,"As 802.11 wireless networks proliferate, interference becomes increasingly severe, particularly in dense, urban environments. These networks are usually operated by different users (eg., tenants in apartments). In this paper, we develop techniques for mitigating interference between such loosely cooperating 802.11 MIMO APs and clients, which do not share a high-speed wired backplane or central controller. We propose CoOperative Power Allocation (COPA), an approach to concurrent wireless medium access that combines fine-grained, per-subcarrier power allocation, nulling, and multi-stream transmission to claim capacity that status-quo approaches cannot. Jointly turning these knobs allows COPA to allocate subcarriers to senders partially, rather than all-or-nothing, and to embrace a measure of interference when doing so increases capacity.",Georgios Nikolaidis and Mark Handley and Kyle Jamieson and Brad Karp,6,7269495150178839425,,,1-13,,COPA: cooperative power allocation for interfering wireless networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2716281.2836103,,2015,/scholar?cites=7269495150178839425,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C

25154,"Currently, Internet congestion control relies on a windowbased mechanism embedded in TCP. This mechanism uses implicit and binary congestion feedback. The feedback is implicit because the sender has to interpret a packet loss as a signal of congestion to which it reacts by halving its sending window. The feedback is binary because the sender knows only whether there is congestion (a packet loss) or there is no congestion (no loss). As a result, the sender must probe the network and continuously oscillate between under-and over-loading its bottleneck. While this protocol is scalable and robust, its implicit and binary feedback does not benefit from the substantial congestion information the routers have.This paper proposes a precise-feedback congestion control protocol, where the network explicitly informs the senders about congestion and how to react to it. Our protocol bases its control decision on the level …",Dina Katabi and Mark Handley,5,11672618188317026525,Proc.

25155,"This paper explores the potential of improving Internet congestion control by providing precise congestion feedback to the sources instead of the implicit and binary feedback used by TCP. We propose a window-based protocol in which each sender maintains its congestion window and round trip time and communicates this information to the routers in a congestion header attached to every packet. The routers use the congestion header to tell each sender the exact amount by which to increase or decrease its congestion window. They apportion the feedback among the flows based on their congestion windows and round trip times provided in the header. The proposed protocol does not require any per-flow state at the routers; nevertheless, its fairness is significantly superior to TCP’s. Further, the queue size under the new protocol is smaller, the link utilization is near optimal and the drop rate is zero in most cases. Moreover, the high responsiveness of the protocol allows efficient operation in very high bandwidth environments and dynamic environments with many short flows. We use simulations in various settings to demonstrate these desirable properties and explore their limitations.",Dina Katabi and Mark Handley,5,12394314891902029806,MIT-LCS Technical Report,0,20,,Using precise feedback for controlling congestion in the Internet,http://publications.csail.mit.edu/publications/pubs/pdf/MIT-LCS-TR-820.pdf,820,2001,/scholar?cites=12394314891902029806,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC

Traditionally, high performance network devices have been built on custom multi-core, specialized memory hierarchies, architectures which are well suited to packet processing. Recently, commodity PC hardware has experienced a move to multiple multi-core chips, as well as the routine inclusion of multiple memory hierarchies in the so-called NUMA architectures. While a PC architecture is obviously not specifically targeted to network applications, it nevertheless provides high performance cheaply. Furthermore, a few commodity switch technologies have recently emerged offering the possibility to control the switching of flows in a rather fine grained manner.

25180,"Can conventional techniques for server virtualization be applied to virtualizing network routers? Such virtual routers would have the potential to open up whole new business models for ISPs or even to provide multiple concurrent network architectures on a single shared physical network. In this paper we explore the design of a flexible and performant virtual router architecture running modern x86 rackmount systems. Each virtual router supported on the base virtualization platform can be independently managed, with the goal being to achieve near-optimal forwarding while still providing inter-router isolation and the flexibility to run nonstandard forwarding code. The difficulty lies in balancing performance, flexibility and isolation. We examine the issue of how well suited the new commodity hardware architectures are for full router virtualization. By exploring the performance limitations and their causes we hope to scope the debate regarding this rapidly expanding area of research with some real data. Beyond this, we aim to examine the trends in PC architecture to foresee their impact on virtual routers, and infer where the use of such routers might be, or become, appropriate.",Norbert Egi and Adam Greenhalgh and Mark Handley and Mickäel Hoerdt and Laurent Mathy,1,3361855271796347164,,,,"Technical Report Research Note RN/08/XX, University College London, Lancaster University",Towards performant virtual routers on commodity hardware,https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.176.3060&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,2008,/scholar?cites=3361855271796347164,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:BrmTIyaxlBUC

25188,"Policy is a crucial component of today’s Internet, allowing ISPs to tune the default behavior of routing protocols to match economic and administrative needs. However, providing powerful and expressive policy controls in router software is not easy and only a few router implementations do this well.In this paper we describe the implementation of an extensible policy framework that can serve both current and future routing protocols. Designing for extensibility makes this hard because policy is both tightly coupled with the details of each specific routing protocol and can also describe subtle interactions between different protocols. Such a policy engine must have no in-built protocol-specific knowledge. However, it must also be capable of satisfying the needs of each specific protocol and cope with filters that span more than one protocol. We present the design of a single generic solution to this problem. Our highly extensible policy framework can support most, if not all, routing protocols with very little work needed on the part of the protocol implementor. We will demonstrate that all this flexibility and generality can be achieved with sufficient performance for even large complex backbone routers.",Andrea Bittau and Mark Handley,1,6130765736382342467,,,,,Decoupling Policy from Protocols: Implementation Issues in Extensible IP Router Software,http://krn.dk/xorp-virt/files/references/ref-18-xorp-mark-handley-policy.pdf,,,/scholar?cites=6130765736382342467,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:kRWSkSYxWN8C
25189,"Despite growing adoption of TLS, a significant fraction of TCP traffic on the Internet remains unencrypted. The persistence of unencrypted traffic can be attributed to at least two factors. First, some legacy protocols lack a signaling mechanism (such as a STARTTLS command) by which to convey support for encryption, thus making incremental deployment impossible. Second, legacy applications themselves cannot always be upgraded and therefore require a way to implement encryption transparently entirely within the transport layer.

25204,"This document describes the messages and procedures of the Negative-acknowledgment (NACK) Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol. This protocol is designed to provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services. NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgment mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to allow for operation with minimal"" a priori"" coordination among senders and receivers. A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol to fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) between the senders and receivers. The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways. The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable multicast transport (RMT) building blocks in its design.",Brian Adamson and Carsten Bormann and Mark Handley and Joseph Macker,0,,,,,,NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) Protocol draft-ietf-rmt-pi-norm-revised-06,http://www.academia.edu/download/50541545/NACK-Oriented_Reliable_Multicast_NORM_20161125-6476-s4196j.pdf,,2008,,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:_AeoHAGD03cC

25206,"The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport protocol that does not provide delivery guarantees and has built-in congestion control [3]. One may think of it as UDP with congestion control, or TCP without reliability. This makes DCCP ideal for multimedia applications that prefer, upon packet loss, sending new data instead of old (and now useless) retransmissions. The congestion control algorithm in DCCP is not fixed and applications may choose which one to use by selecting the appropriate Congestion Control Identifier (CCID). Currently, there are two CCIDs defined: CCID2 which is TCP-like and CCID3 which is TFRC [2]. In this paper we focus on the implementation issues of DCCP rather than on its design. Our work has been carried out as protocol research in the context of e-VLBI, an application where multiple data streams from different telescopes are correlated to produce an image. The requirements for e-VLBI are transmitting large amounts of data at a (very high) constant bit-rate, and packet loss can be tolerated. TCP is inadequate for e-VLBI due to its bad performance when dealing with large windows. UDP is partially suitable for e-VLBI since it may not be used on shared links (eg Internet, or shared academic networks) due to its lack of congestion control. DCCP is the best fit—it can transmit data at a constant bit-rate (CCID3) and in the case of congestion, it will back off. In the following sections we will discuss the major implementation differences in Linux between DCCP, TCP and UDP, followed by some performance considerations.",Andrea Bittau and Mark Handley,0,,,,,,Implementing DCCP: Differences from TCP and UDP,https://pos.sissa.it/041/003/pdf,,2007,,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:URolC5Kub84C

25236,"This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers.",PBX Customizable and J Rosenberg and J Peterson and H Schulzrinne and G Camarillo,0,,,,,,OZEKI Phone System XE,http://www.ozekiphone.com/voip-rfc-3550-113.html,,,,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:EPG8bYD4jVwC

25245,"Multicast routing enables efficient data distribution to multiple recipients. However, existing work has concentrated on extending single-domain techniques to wide-area networks, rather than providing mechanisms to realize inter-domain multicast on a global scale in the Internet. We describe an architecture for inter-domain multicast routing that consists of two complementary protocols. The Multicast Address-Set Claim (MASC) protocol forms the basis for a hierarchical address allocation architecture. It dynamically allocates to domains multicast address ranges from which groups initiated in the domain get their multicast addresses. The Border-Gateway Multicast Protocol (BGMP), run by the border routers of a domain, constructs inter-domain bidirectional shared trees, while allowing any existing multicast routing protocol to be used within individual domains.

In these applications, server should be able to perform end-to-end congestion control and quality adaptation to match the delivered stream quality to the average available bandwidth. The delivered quality is limited by the bottleneck bandwidth on the path to the client. This paper proposes a proxy caching mechanism for layered-encoded multimedia streams in the Internet to maximize the delivered quality of popular streams to interested clients. The main challenge is to replay a quality-variable cached stream while performing quality adaptation effectively in response to the variations in available bandwidth. We present a pre-fetching mechanism to support higher quality cached streams during subsequent playbacks and improve the quality of the cached stream with its popularity.

25257,"It has been claimed that multicast state cannot be aggregated. In this paper, we will debunk this myth and present a simple technique that can be used to aggregate multicast forwarding state. In particular, we present an interface-centric data structure model which allows aggregation of ranges of multicast addresses in the forwarding table. Understanding the limits of possible aggregation is critical to our knowledge of how IP multicast will scale as it becomes widely deployed. We show through analysis and simulation that some aggregation is possible, even under purely random address allocation and purely random group membership distribution. We further show how other methods of allocation can significantly improve the ability to aggregate, and how non-random distributions of membership can affect aggregation both positively and negatively.",Mark Handley and Dave Thaler,0,,,,,,On the Aggregatability of Multicast Forwarding State,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2628297439921768079&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,,,XRyUF6gAAAAJ:SdhP9T11ey4C
