26000,"The design of sustainable wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a very challenging issue. On the one hand, energy-constrained sensors are expected to run autonomously for long periods. However, it may be cost-prohibitive to replace exhausted batteries or even impossible in hostile environments. On the other hand, unlike other networks, WSNs are designed for specific applications which range from small-size healthcare surveillance systems to large-scale environmental monitoring. Thus, any WSN deployment has to satisfy a set of requirements that differs from one application to another. In this context, a host of research work has been conducted in order to propose a wide range of solutions to the energy-saving problem. This research covers several areas going from physical layer optimisation to network layer solutions. Therefore, it is not easy for the WSN designer to select the efficient solutions that should be …",Tifenn Rault and Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah and Yacine Challal,765,4131130361008006211,,,104-122,Elsevier,Energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks: A top-down survey,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128614001418,67,2014,/scholar?cites=4131130361008006211,A-ac-iAAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC

It has been demonstrated that the use of a mobile sink can significantly increase the network lifetime by balancing the load among nodes. However, in existing solutions, nodes either send their data through multihop towards the sink which induces energy consumption due to relaying process, or the nodes store the data until the sink comes at their vicinity, which usually requires an infinite buffer capacity or induces buffer overflow if the buffer is of fixed size. In this paper, we propose a new approach in which nodes send their data through multihop path of reduced length by offering nodes the possibility to buffer data while waiting the sink coming closer (not necessarily at node range), which exempts more sensors from relaying these data.

26077,"Maximizing the lifetime of energy constrained wireless sensor networks is a very challenging issue. It has been demonstrated that the use of a mobile sink can significantly increase the network lifetime by balancing the load among nodes. However, in existing solutions, nodes either send their data through multihop towards the sink or store the data until the sink comes at the node's vicinity, which usually requires an infinite buffer capacity. In this paper, we propose a new approach in which nodes send their data through multihop towards the sink, but they have the possibility to bufferize data while waiting the sink coming closer (not necessarily at node's radio range), which exempts more sensors from relaying these data. This strategy allows to save energy, while ensuring there is no data loss due to buffer overflow. We modelize the problem of optimizing WSN lifetime with limited buffer capacity and controlled mobile sink using a Linear Program (LP). For arbitrary topologies, our LP determines the sink sojourn times at each possible locations, the data transfer rates between nodes and the bufferized packets quantities. Compared to previous models, our solution achieves better lifetime and enables to generate and transmit more data to the mobile sink. We show that this lifespan prolongation does not results in an increased energy consumption at nodes level. Finally, the numerical results give useful indications for network dimensioning in terms of buffer capacity and link capacity.",Tifenn Rault and Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah and Yacine Challal,6,15381733373613487999,,,,,WSN lifetime optimization through controlled sink mobility and packet bufferization,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00871203/,,2013,/scholar?cites=15381733373613487999,A-ac-iAAAAAJ:bFI3QPDXJZMC

We show that the basic mapping from unitals to key pre-distribution allows us to achieve high network scalability. Nonetheless, this naive mapping does not guarantee a high key sharing probability. Therefore, we propose an enhanced unital-based key pre-distribution scheme providing high network scalability and good key sharing probability approximately lower bounded by 1− e 0.632.

The actuators are responsible for taking prompt decisions and react accordingly to the data gathered by sensor nodes. In order to ensure efficient actions in such networks, we propose a new routing protocol that provides QoS in terms of delay and energy consumption. The network is organized in clusters supervised by CHs (Cluster-Heads), elected according to important metrics, namely the energy capability, the riches of connectivity, which is used to select the CH with high node density, and the accessibility degree regarding all the actuators. The latter metric is the distance in number of hops of sensor nodes relative to the actuator nodes. This metric enhances more the network reliability by reducing the communication delay when alerting the actuator nodes, and hence, reducing the energy consumption. To reach efficiently the actuator nodes, we design a delay and energy sensitive routing protocol based on-demand routing approach. Our protocol incurs less delay and is energy efficient.

26128,"The quality of radio communication links decreases with high temperatures. In this paper, we investigate the effect of temperature on percolation-based connectivity in large scale wireless sensor networks and show that more energy can be saved by allowing some nodes to go to deep sleep mode when temperature decreases and links improve. We determine a closed-form formula for a threshold network density equation in function of temperature τ. Beyond λ*(τ), the network percolates and guarantees connectivity. Based on this result, we propose a simple yet efficient Temperature-Aware MAC plugin (TA-MAC) that enables the underlying MAC protocol to dynamically adapt the network effective density to allow further energy savings while maintaining network connectivity. TA-MAC can be potentially used with any wireless MAC protocol.

26136,"Recently introduced, Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising cryptographic method proposed by Sahai and Waters. This technique provides means for designing scalable and fine-grained access control. In ABE, data are encrypted with an access structure which is the logical expression of the access policy (eg: the data can be accessed by physician in cardiology division or by nurses). The cyphertext (encrypted data) can be decrypted by any user if his secret key has attributes that satisfy the access policy. The power of ABE is that we do not need to rely on the storage server for avoiding unauthorized data access since the access policy is embedded in the cyphertext itself. This makes ABE good solution to provide a fine-grained access control for medical applications, where data is outsourced on untrusted servers like the case of the Cloud. However, for emergency management, integrating ABE creates particular challenges for providing temporary access victims medical data when this is needed.

26147,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications and services have gained a huge deployment and adoption in different fields, such as the military domain (Defense or reconnaissance) and the civilian domain (Healthcare, surveillance, and transport). UAV operations are generally critical and require, during operations, a control link with the drones, which should be reliable with very low latency. To ensure low-latency, 5G architecture intends to deploy Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers, which provide cloud computing capabilities close to the end-users. Consequently, it is envisioned that the AutoPilot application will be deployed at the MEC in order to ensure a low latency connection to the drones. However, the high mobility of drones makes the migration of the AutoPilot applications among MEC servers unavoidable; in order to maintain a low latency connection with the flying drones. This may lead to frequent downtime of the service, which may impact the AutoPilot performances, and hence service migrations should be limited as much as possible. Accordingly, this paper aims to reduce the number of service migrations of drones by introducing novel algorithms that act at the mission planning phase, where the path of the drones is defined.",Samir Si-Mohammed and Adlen Ksentini and Maha Bouaziz and Yacine Challal and Amar Balla,0,,,,,,UAV mission optimization in 5G: On reducing MEC service relocation,https://www.eurecom.fr/publication/6351/download/comsys-publi-6351.pdf,,,,A-ac-iAAAAAJ:8d8msizDQcsC

26157,"Peer-to-peer (p2p) networking technology has gained popularity as an efficient mechanism for users to obtain free services without the need for centralized servers. Protecting these networks from intruders and attackers is a real challenge. One of the constant threats on P2P networks is the propagation of active worms. Recent events show that active worms can spread automatically and flood the Internet in a very short period of time. Therefore, P2P systems can be a potential vehicle for active worms to achieve fast worm propagation in the Internet. Nowadays, BitTorrent is becoming more and more popular, mainly due its fair load distribution mechanism. Unfortunately, BitTorrent is particularly vulnerable to topology aware active worms. In this paper we analyze the impact of BitTorrent on active worm propagation in the Internet. We identify the characteristics that accelerate and decelerate their propagation, and develop a mathematical model of their propagation. We also provide numerical analysis results. This will help the design of efficient detection and containment systems.",Sinan Hatahet and Abdelmadjid Bouabdallah and Yacine Challal,0,,,,,,Topology Aware Worm Propagation in BitTorrent: Modeling and Analysis,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.411.5445&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,,,A-ac-iAAAAAJ:HE397vMXCloC
