6000,"A search for the Standard Model Higgs boson in proton–proton collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The datasets used correspond to integrated luminosities of approximately 4.8 fb− 1 collected at s= 7 TeV in 2011 and 5.8 fb− 1 at s= 8 TeV in 2012. Individual searches in the channels H→ Z Z (⁎)→ 4 ℓ, H→ γ γ and H→ W W (⁎)→ e ν μ ν in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H→ Z Z (⁎), W W (⁎), b b¯ and τ+ τ− in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H→ Z Z (⁎)→ 4 ℓ and H→ γ γ channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0±0.4 (stat)±0.4 (sys) GeV is presented.

6001,"The simulation software for the ATLAS Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider is being used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid.

In the focus are the investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking and linked to this the search for the Higgs boson as well as the search for Physics beyond the Standard Model. In this report a detailed examination of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector is provided, with a major aim being to investigate the experimental sensitivity to a wide range of measurements and potential observations of new physical processes.

6008,"The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb−1. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-k  t  algorithm with distance parameters R=0.4 or R=0.6.

Nine signal regions are considered with increasing missing transverse momentum requirements between  GeV and  GeV.

Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections.

The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation. After all corrections, the  resonance is used to set the absolute energy scale. For electrons from  decays, the achieved calibration is typically accurate to 0.05 % in most of the detector acceptance, rising to 0.2 % in regions with large amounts of passive material.

We select events in which one neutral B meson is fully reconstructed in a final state containing charmonium and the flavor of the other neutral B meson is determined from its decay products. The amplitude of the CP-violating asymmetry, which in the standard model is proportional to sin 2 β, is derived from the decay time distributions in such events.

6029,"Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay rates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production processes, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a  or a  boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes , , and . All results are reported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of the combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses the CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per experiment of approximately 5 fb  at  TeV and 20 fb  at  TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the two experiments are combined within the context of three generic parameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one on ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements with more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal yield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.090.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector boson fusion production process and for the  decay of  and  standard deviations, respectively.

6036,"A measurement of the jet activity in tt events produced in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented, using 2.05 fb^(−1) of integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The tt events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented as a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval definitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, Powheg, Alpgen and Sherpa. The experimental uncertainties are often smaller than the spread of theoretical predictions, allowing deviations between data and theory to be observed in some regions of phase space.",Melissa Franklin and John Huth and L Jeanty and M Kagan and David Lopez Mateos and Kevin Mercurio and Masahiro Morii and Hugh Philip Skottowe and G Zevi Della Porta,887,4063488935377422586,The European Physical Journal C,,,Springer Nature,Measurement of tt production with a veto on additional central jet activity in pp collisions at√ s= 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/33470698,,2012,/scholar?cites=4063488935377422586,jB7gVJAAAAAJ:ojlX30-wUrgC

To reconstruct ETmiss, fully calibrated electrons, muons, photons, hadronically decaying τ-leptons, and jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits and charged-particle tracks are used. These are combined with the soft hadronic activity measured by reconstructed charged-particle tracks not associated with the hard objects. Possible double counting of contributions from reconstructed charged-particle tracks from the inner detector, energy deposits in the calorimeter, and reconstructed muons from the muon spectrometer is avoided by applying a signal ambiguity resolution procedure which rejects already used signals when combining the various ETmiss contributions.

6045,"The inclusive Drell-Yan [1] production cross sections of W and Z bosons have been an important testing ground for QCD. Theoretical calculations of this process extend to next-to-leading order (NLO)[2–4] and next-to-next-toleading order (NNLO)[5–9] perturbation theory. Crucial ingredients of the resulting QCD cross section calculations are the parametrizations of the momentum distribution functions of partons in the proton (PDFs). These have been determined recently in a variety of phenomenological analyses to NLO QCD by the CTEQ [10, 11] group and to NNLO by the MSTW [12], ABKM [13, 14], HERAPDF [15, 16], JR [17], and NNPDF [18, 19] groups.

Compared to the initial measurement by the ATLAS Collaboration [20], the data set is enlarged by 100 and the luminosity uncertainty significantly reduced [21] from 11% to 3.4%. The CMS Collaboration has updated their initial measurement of total W and Z cross sections [22] to include data corresponding to an integrated luminosity similar to that used here [23]. Similar measurements have been performed at the p"" p collider Tevatron by the CDF and D0 collaborations [24, 25]. The presented cross section values are integrated over the fiducial region of the analysis and also extrapolated to the full kinematic range.

6052,"This paper presents the application of a variety of techniques to study jet substructure. The performance of various modified jet algorithms, or jet grooming techniques, for several jet types and event topologies is investigated for jets with transverse momentum larger than 300 GeV. Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects.

6060,"A search is presented for the pair production of heavy vector-like T quarks, primarily targeting the T quark decays to a W boson and a b-quark.

Data are analysed in the lepton-plus-jets final state, including at least one b-tagged jet and a large-radius jet identified as originating from the hadronic decay of a high-momentum W boson. No significant deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed in the reconstructed T mass distribution.

6076,"Results are reported from a search for supersymmetry in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, based on events with a single isolated lepton (electron or muon) and multiple jets, at least two of which are identified as b jets. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb− 1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2012. The search is motivated by supersymmetric models that involve strong-production processes and cascade decays of new particles.

These trends are not reproduced by predictions based on the Glauber model, which includes only the correlations from the collision geometry in the initial state.

6081,"The inspiration for this book came from François le Diberder. During his term as spokesperson for B 八 B 八 R he laid down a vision for the two B Factory detector collaborations, B 八 B 八 R and Belle, to work together on a book that would describe the methodologies used and physics results obtained by those experiments. A key ideal emphasized from the outset was that this book should be written from a pedagogical perspective; it should be of interest to the student and expert alike. This vision was presented during a B 八 B 八 R collaboration meeting on the island of Elba in May 2008 and a follow up Belle collaboration meeting at KEK, with visiting colleagues from the B 八 B 八 R collaboration, and was embraced by the community. A number of workshops involving people from the theoretical community as well as the two collaborations were held on four continents over the following years. The resulting book,“The Physics of the B Factories”, is a testament to the way that this concept captured the zeitgeist on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.This book is divided into three parts, the first of which provides a brief description of the B Factories, including a short (though not exhaustive) historical perspective, as well as descriptions of the detectors, ancillary data acquisition systems and data (re) processing systems that were built by the two detector collaborations in the late 1990’s.

In other cases, the highest energy jet is tagged as a b jet or as a light quark (uds) jet using secondary vertex or track impact parameter and momentum information. Comparing the two lower energy jets of the events with a tag in the highest energy jet to the anti-tagged gluon jets yields a direct comparison of b, uds and gluon jets, which are produced with the same energy of about 24 GeV and under the same conditions.

The measurement uses a data sample of 23× 10 6 ϒ (4 S)→ B B decays collected by the BABAR detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B Factory at SLAC. In this sample, we find events in which one neutral B meson is fully reconstructed in a CP eigenstate containing charmonium and the flavor of the other neutral B meson is determined from its decay products. The amplitude of the CP-violating asymmetry, which in the standard model is proportional to sin 2 β, is derived from the decay time distributions in such events.

6118,"Using the ATLAS detector, a centrality-dependent suppression has been observed in the yield of J/ψ mesons produced in the collisions of lead ions at the Large Hadron Collider. In a sample of minimum-bias lead–lead collisions at a nucleon–nucleon centre of mass energy s N N= 2.76 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 6.7 μb− 1, J/ψ mesons are reconstructed via their decays to μ+ μ− pairs. The measured J/ψ yield, normalized to the number of binary nucleon–nucleon collisions, is found to significantly decrease from peripheral to central collisions.

6142,"Properties of the Higgs boson are measured in the two-photon final state using 36.1 fb− 1 of proton–proton collision data recorded at s= 13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Cross-section measurements for the production of a Higgs boson through gluon–gluon fusion, vector-boson fusion, and in association with a vector boson or a top-quark pair are reported. The signal strength, defined as the ratio of the observed to the expected signal yield, is measured for each of these production processes as well as inclusively.

The combination is based on the analyses of the Higgs boson decay modes H→ γ γ, Z Z*, W W*, τ τ, b b, μ μ, searches for decays into invisible final states, and on measurements of off-shell Higgs boson production. Up to 79.8 fb− 1 of proton–proton collision data collected at s= 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector are used. Results are presented for the gluon–gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes, and for associated production with vector bosons or top-quarks. The global signal strength is determined to be μ= 1.1 1− 0.08+ 0.09.

6175,"This paper presents the method and performance of primary vertex reconstruction in proton–proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment during Run 1 of the LHC. The studies presented focus on data taken during 2012 at a centre-of-mass energy of  TeV. The performance has been measured as a function of the number of interactions per bunch crossing over a wide range, from one to seventy. The measurement of the position and size of the luminous region and its use as a constraint to improve the primary vertex resolution are discussed. A longitudinal vertex position resolution of about  is achieved for events with high multiplicity of reconstructed tracks. The transverse position resolution is better than  and is dominated by the precision on the size of the luminous region.

The search is performed in multilepton final states using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb−1 of proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at a center-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. Higgs boson decays to WW*, ττ, and ZZ* are targeted. Seven final states, categorized by the number and flavor of charged-lepton candidates, are examined for the presence of the Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV and a pair of top quarks. An excess of events over the expected background from Standard Model processes is found with an observed significance of 4.1 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of 2.8 standard deviations.

They are based on 20.3 fb−1 of pp collision data, produced at √s = 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy at the LHC and recorded by the ATLAS detector. The differential measurements are performed in bins of transverse momentum and rapidity of the four-lepton system, the invariant mass of the subleading lepton pair and the decay angle of the leading lepton pair with respect to the beam line in the four-lepton rest frame, as well as the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the leading jet.

6216,The differential cross-section for pair production of top quarks with high transverse momentum is measured in 20.3 fb− 1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The measurement is performed for t t events in the lepton+ jets channel. The cross-section is reported as a function of the hadronically decaying top quark transverse momentum for values above 300 GeV. The hadronically decaying top quark is reconstructed as an anti-k t jet with radius parameter R= 1.0 and identified with jet substructure techniques. The observed yield is corrected for detector effects to obtain a cross-section at particle level in a fiducial region close to the event selection.

The results of these studies in Monte Carlo simulations show that a simple pairwise combination of groomed jet mass and one substructure variable can provide a 50 % efficiency for identifying W bosons with transverse momenta larger than 200 GeV while maintaining multijet background efficiencies of 2–4 % for jets with the same transverse momentum.

A search was performed for top-quark pair-production events, with one top quark decaying through the t→ Zq FCNC (q= u, c) channel, and the other through the Standard Model dominant mode t→ W b. Only the decays of the Z boson to charged leptons and leptonic W-boson decays were considered as signal. Consequently, the final-state topology is characterised by the presence of three isolated charged leptons, at least two jets and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. No evidence for an FCNC signal was found.

6234,This article reports on a search for dark matter pair production in association with bottom or top quarks in  of  collisions collected at  TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events with large missing transverse momentum are selected when produced in association with high-momentum jets of which one or more are identified as jets containing -quarks. Final states with top quarks are selected by requiring a high jet multiplicity and in some cases a single lepton. The data are found to be consistent with the Standard Model expectations and limits are set on the mass scale of effective field theories that describe scalar and tensor interactions between dark matter and Standard Model particles. Limits on the dark-matter–nucleon cross-section for spin-independent and spin-dependent interactions are also provided. These limits are particularly strong for low-mass dark matter.

6249,Measurements of fiducial cross sections for the electroweak production of two jets in association with a Z-boson are presented. The measurements are performed using 20. 3 fb− 1 of proton-proton collision data collected at a centre-of-mass energy of= 8 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The electroweak component is extracted by a fit to the dijet invariant mass distribution in a fiducial region chosen to enhance the electroweak contribution over the dominant background in which the jets are produced via the strong interaction. The electroweak cross sections measured in two fiducial regions are in good agreement with the Standard Model expectations and the background-only hypothesis is rejected with significance above the 5σ level.

6272,"This paper describes the implementation and performance of a particle flow algorithm applied to 20.2 fb of ATLAS data from 8 TeV proton–proton collisions in Run 1 of the LHC. The algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons from consideration during jet reconstruction, instead using measurements of their momenta from the inner tracker. This improves the accuracy of the charged-hadron measurement, while retaining the calorimeter measurements of neutral-particle energies. The paper places emphasis on how this is achieved, while minimising double-counting of charged-hadron signals between the inner tracker and calorimeter. The performance of particle flow jets, formed from the ensemble of signals from the calorimeter and the inner tracker, is compared to that of jets reconstructed from calorimeter energy deposits alone, demonstrating improvements in resolution and …",Morad Aaboud and G Aad and B Abbott and J Abdallah and B Abeloos and SH Abidi and OS AbouZeid and NL Abraham and H Abramowicz and H Abreu and R Abreu and Y Abulaiti and BS Acharya and S Adachi and L Adamczyk and J Adelman and M Adersberger and T Adye and AA Affolder and T Agatonovic-Jovin and C Agheorghiesei and JA Aguilar-Saavedra and SP Ahlen and F Ahmadov and G Aielli and S Akatsuka and H Akerstedt and TPA Åkesson and AV Akimov and GL Alberghi and J Albert and MJ Alconada Verzini and M Aleksa and IN Aleksandrov and C Alexa and G Alexander and T Alexopoulos and M Alhroob and B Ali and M Aliev and G Alimonti and J Alison and SP Alkire and BMM Allbrooke and BW Allen and PP Allport and A Aloisio and A Alonso and F Alonso and C Alpigiani and AA Alshehri and M Alstaty and B Alvarez Gonzalez and D Álvarez Piqueras and MG Alviggi and BT Amadio and Y Amaral Coutinho and C Amelung and D Amidei and SP Amor Dos Santos and A Amorim and S Amoroso and G Amundsen and C Anastopoulos and LS Ancu and N Andari and T Andeen and CF Anders and JK Anders and KJ Anderson and A Andreazza and V Andrei and S Angelidakis and I Angelozzi and A Angerami and F Anghinolfi and AV Anisenkov and N Anjos and A Annovi and C Antel and M Antonelli and A Antonov and DJ Antrim and F Anulli and M Aoki and L Aperio Bella and G Arabidze and Y Arai and JP Araque and V Araujo Ferraz and ATH Arce and RE Ardell and FA Arduh and J-F Arguin and S Argyropoulos and M Arik and AJ Armbruster and LJ Armitage and O Arnaez and H Arnold and M Arratia and O Arslan and A Artamonov and G Artoni and S Artz and S Asai and N Asbah and A Ashkenazi and L Asquith and K Assamagan and R Astalos and M Atkinson and NB Atlay and K Augsten and G Avolio and B Axen and MK Ayoub and G Azuelos and AE Baas and MJ Baca and H Bachacou and K Bachas and M Backes and M Backhaus and P Bagiacchi and P Bagnaia and H Bahrasemani and JT Baines and M Bajic and OK Baker and EM Baldin and P Balek and T Balestri and F Balli and WK Balunas and E Banas and Sw Banerjee and AAE Bannoura and L Barak and EL Barberio and D Barberis and M Barbero and T Barillari and M-S Barisits and T Barklow and N Barlow and SL Barnes and BM Barnett and RM Barnett and Z Barnovska-Blenessy,177,352851877315860265,The European Physical Journal C,7,466,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Jet reconstruction and performance using particle flow with the ATLAS Detector,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-017-5031-2,77,2017,/scholar?cites=352851877315860265,jB7gVJAAAAAJ:P2d6BWbXU0IC

6301,"Correlations between the elliptic or triangular flow coefficients v m (m= 2 or 3) and other flow harmonics v n (n= 2 to 5) are measured using s N N= 2.76 TeV Pb+ Pb collision data collected in 2010 by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 7 μ b− 1. The v m− v n correlations are measured in midrapidity as a function of centrality, and, for events within the same centrality interval, as a function of event ellipticity or triangularity defined in a forward rapidity region. For events within the same centrality interval, v 3 is found to be anticorrelated with v 2 and this anticorrelation is consistent with similar anticorrelations between the corresponding eccentricities, ε 2 and ε 3. However, it is observed that v 4 increases strongly with v 2, and v 5 increases strongly with both v 2 and v 3.

6316,The jet fragmentation function and transverse profile for jets with 25 GeV<p T jet<500 GeV and |η jet|<1.2 produced in proton–proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV are presented. The measurement is performed using data with an integrated luminosity of 36 pb−1. Jets are reconstructed and their momentum measured using calorimetric information. The momenta of the charged particle constituents are measured using the tracking system.

It is based on an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb− 1 of pp collisions at TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The final state of interest is a disappearing track accompanied by at least one jet with high transverse momentum from initial-state radiation or by four jets from the gluino decay chain. The use of short track segments reconstructed from the innermost tracking layers significantly improves the sensitivity to short chargino lifetimes. The results are found to be consistent with Standard Model predictions. Exclusion limits are set at 95% confidence level on the mass of charginos and gluinos for different chargino lifetimes. For a pure wino with a lifetime of about 0.2 ns, chargino masses up to 460 GeV are excluded.

This allows for a search for high-mass W′ bosons in the range 1.5-3.0 TeV. b-tagging is used to identify jets originating from b-quarks. The data are consistent with Standard Model background-only expectations, and upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the W′→ tb cross section times branching ratio ranging from 0.16 pb to 0.33 pb for left-handed W′ bosons, and ranging from 0.10 pb to 0.21 pb for W′ bosons with purely righthanded couplings.

6382,"Proton collisions at the LHC have large cross-sections for the production of top quark pairs, W boson pairs, and Z bosons. The cross-section for each of these processes is predicted to a high precision within the standard model (SM) of particle physics. In this article, a global test of these SM predictions is presented through the study of a common final state including an oppositely charged electron and muon pair (eμ events). Specifically, a simultaneous measurement of the cross-sections of the pair production of top quarks (tt), W bosons (WþW−, written as WW), and tau leptons via the Drell-Yan mechanism (Z= γÃ→ ττ) is performed.

6383,"Similarities between leptons and quarks in the Standard Model (SM) suggest that they might be a part of some symmetry at energy scales above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale. In this type of symmetry, transitions between leptons and quarks, mediated by a new type of gauge boson, a leptoquark (LQ), may occur. LQs are putative color-triplet bosons with spin 0 or 1, and fractional electric charge [1]. They are predicted in many extensions of the SM, such as Grand Unification models, and possess both quark and lepton quantum numbers. The Yukawa coupling λLQ− l− q of a leptoquark to a lepton and a quark, and the branching ratio (β) to a charged lepton, are model dependent. In pp collisions, if λLQ− l− q is of the order of the electroweak coupling strength, leptoquarks are predominantly produced in pairs via the strong interaction. At the LHC, the pair production cross section is dominated by gluon fusion for LQ masses mLQ% 1 TeV, whereas at higher masses it is dominated by quark–antiquark annihilation. Under these assumptions, the production rate for scalar LQs depends only on the known QCD coupling constant and the unknown LQ mass, and has been calculated at up to next-to-leading order. It is usually assumed that leptoquarks only couple to one generation of SM isospin multiplet to accommodate experimental constraints on flavor-changing neutral currents, and lepton and baryon number violation [2]. Consequently, they are classified as first, second, or third generation according to the fermion generation to which they couple [3]. Lower mass limits on the first generation LQs al-",ATLAS Collaboration,132,4431542482436339072,Physics Letters B,,158-176,,Search for first generation scalar leptoquarks in pp collisions at,https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/concern/theses/dj52w609h,709,2012,/scholar?cites=4431542482436339072,jB7gVJAAAAAJ:HIFyuExEbWQC

6391,"This Letter presents evidence for single top-quark production in the s-channel using proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analysis is performed on events containing one isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and exactly two b-tagged jets in the final state.

This analysis uses the full data sample collected during 2011 running that corresponds to a total integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb−1. Light scalar top quarks are searched for in events with two opposite-sign leptons (e, μ), large missing transverse momentum and at least one jet in the final state.

Data from pp collisions at the LHC were collected at √s=8 TeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb −¹. The angle θ∗ between the b-quark from the top quark decay and a direct W boson decay product in the W boson rest frame is sensitive to the W boson polarisation. Two different W decay products are used as polarisation analysers: the charged lepton and the down-type quark for the leptonically and hadronically decaying W boson, respectively. The most precise measurement of the W boson polarisation via the distribution of cosθ∗ is obtained using the leptonic analyser and events in which at least two of the jets are tagged as b-quark jets.

6463,"We present a search for the decay B+→ τ+ ν using 383× 10 6 B B pairs collected at the Υ (4 S) resonance with the BABAR detector at the SLAC PEP-II B-Factory. A sample of events with one reconstructed semileptonic B decay (B−→ D 0 ℓ− ν ℓ X) is selected, and in the recoil a search for B+→ τ+ ν is performed. The τ is identified in the following channels: τ+→ e+ ν ν, τ+→ μ+ ν ν, τ+→ π+ ν, and τ+→ π+ π 0 ν. We measure a branching fraction of B (B+→ τ+ ν)=(0.9±0.6 (stat.)±0.1 (syst.))× 10− 4. In the absence of a significant signal, we calculate an upper limit at the 90% confidence level of B (B+→ τ+ ν)< 1.7× 10− 4.
