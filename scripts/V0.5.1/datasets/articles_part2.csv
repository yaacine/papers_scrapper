2000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, with estimates of 4 million HCV-infected individuals in the United States and 170 million worldwide 1. Most (70–80%) HCV infections persist and about 30% of individuals with persistent infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 2. Epidemiological, viral and host factors have been associated with the differences in HCV clearance or persistence, and studies have demonstrated that a strong host immune response against HCV favours viral clearance 3, 4. Thus, variation in genes involved in the immune response may contribute to the ability to clear the virus. In a recent genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860) 3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene, which encodes the type III interferon IFN-λ3, was shown to associate strongly with more …",David L Thomas and Chloe L Thio and Maureen P Martin and Ying Qi and Dongliang Ge and Colm O’hUigin and Judith Kidd and Kenneth Kidd and Salim I Khakoo and Graeme Alexander and James J Goedert and Gregory D Kirk and Sharyne M Donfield and Hugo R Rosen and Leslie H Tobler and Michael P Busch and John G McHutchison and David B Goldstein and Mary Carrington,2395,17515851486538407948,Nature,7265,798-801,Nature Publishing Group,Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08463,461,2009,/scholar?cites=17515851486538407948,11F_c5oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC
2001,"Accurate estimates of the risk of transfusion-transmitted infectious disease are essential for monitoring the safety of the blood supply and evaluating the potential effect of new screening tests. We estimated the risk of transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) from screened blood units donated during the window period following a recent, undetected infection.Using data on 586,507 persons who each donated blood more than once between 1991 and 1993 at five blood centers (for a total of 2,318,356 allogeneic blood donations), we calculated the incidence rates of seroconversion among those whose donations passed all the screening tests used.

2007,"As the immune system develops, T cells are selected or regulated to become tolerant of self antigens and reactive against foreign antigens. In mice, the induction of such tolerance is thought to be attributable to the deletion of self-reactive cells. Here, we show that the human fetal immune system takes advantage of an additional mechanism: the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress fetal immune responses. We find that substantial numbers of maternal cells cross the placenta to reside in fetal lymph nodes, inducing the development of CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ Tregs that suppress fetal antimaternal immunity and persist at least until early adulthood. These findings reveal a form of antigen-specific tolerance in humans, induced in utero and probably active in regulating immune responses after birth.",Jeff E Mold and Jakob Michaëlsson and Trevor D Burt and Marcus O Muench and Karen P Beckerman and Michael P Busch and Tzong-Hae Lee and Douglas F Nixon and Joseph M McCune,719,15029233448711736305,Science,5907,1562-1565,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Maternal alloantigens promote the development of tolerogenic fetal regulatory T cells in utero,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/322/5907/1562.abstract,322,2008,/scholar?cites=15029233448711736305,11F_c5oAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC

Samples from blood, spinal fluid, lymph node, and gut were analyzed in multiple laboratories using different approaches. No HIV DNA or RNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), spinal fluid, lymph node, or terminal ileum, and no replication-competent virus could be cultured from PBMCs. However, HIV RNA was detected in plasma (2 laboratories) and HIV DNA was detected in the rectum (1 laboratory) at levels considerably lower than those expected in ART-suppressed patients. It was not possible to obtain sequence data from plasma or gut, while an X4 sequence from PBMC did not match the pre-transplant sequence. HIV antibody levels were readily detectable but declined over time; T cell responses were largely absent.

2035,"As the safety of blood transfusion has dramati-cally improved with respect to transmission of viral infection, one of the remaining challenges has been to accurately estimate the risk (termed the residual risk) of transfusion-transmitted viral infection for those viruses (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]) for which donor screening is routinely performed. The basic tool applied to this task has been mathematical modeling, with the most commonly used model being the incidence rate–window period (I-WP) model. Originally developed in the mid-1990s, this model has been accepted as a valid and accurate approach by blood bankers and regulators around the world and it has widely been used by many international investigators to generate country specific residual risk estimates. 1-6 An understanding of the relationship between viral load and infectivity is important for calculating the residual risk of infection using the I-WP model. An important variable in the model is the appropriate assignment of infectious risk to blood units (and their associated components) collected in the diagnostic window period (ie, the time from the donor being exposed to the virus until the infection is detectable by a blood screening assay). 1, 7-9 From the transfusion safety as opposed to the diagnostic perspective, the window period used in the model ideally would correspond exactly to the time interval during which a donation is infectious.

We sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of TDR and to identify the HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations responsible for TDR in different regions and virus subtypes.   Methods and Findings We reviewed all GenBank submissions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences with or without protease and identified 287 studies published between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, with more than 25 recently or chronically infected ARV-naïve individuals. These studies comprised 50,870 individuals from 111 countries. Each set of study sequences was analyzed for phylogenetic clustering and the presence of 93 surveillance drug-resistance mutations (SDRMs).

Although each donated unit of blood is tested for evidence of infection by specific viral agents, there are at least four potential reasons why transmission of these viral agents still might occur. The primary reason is that the donor has negative laboratory test results during the early stages of infection, known as the window period. A second factor contributing to the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection'for some agents is the existence of a chronic carrier state in which a clinically asymptomatic donor will persistently test negative on a donation screening assay.

2048,"West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging flavivirus capable of infecting the central nervous system (CNS) and mediating neuronal cell death and tissue destruction. The processes that promote inflammation and encephalitis within the CNS are important for control of WNV disease but, how inflammatory signaling pathways operate to control CNS infection is not defined. Here, we identify IL-1β signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome as key host restriction factors involved in viral control and CNS disease associated with WNV infection. Individuals presenting with acute WNV infection displayed elevated levels of IL-1β in their plasma over the course of infection, suggesting a role for IL-1β in WNV immunity. Indeed, we found that in a mouse model of infection, WNV induced the acute production of IL-1β in vivo, and that animals lacking the IL-1 receptor or components involved in inflammasome signaling complex exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV pathogenesis. This outcome associated with increased accumulation of virus within the CNS but not peripheral tissues and was further associated with altered kinetics and magnitude of inflammation, reduced quality of the effector CD8+ T cell response and reduced anti-viral activity within the CNS. Importantly, we found that WNV infection triggers production of IL-1β from cortical neurons. Furthermore, we found that IL-1β signaling synergizes with type I IFN to suppress WNV replication in neurons, thus implicating antiviral activity of IL-1β within neurons and control of virus replication within the CNS.

We consider both synchronous and asynchronous processes of viral infection of new target cells. The model enables an assessment of the expected sequence diversity in new HIV-1 infections originating from a single transmitted viral strain, estimation of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the transmitted viral lineage, and estimation of the time to coalesce back to the MRCA.

2072,"Sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) most often results from productive infection by a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, indicating a stringent mucosal bottleneck. Understanding the viral traits that overcome this bottleneck could have important implications for HIV-1 vaccine design and other prevention strategies. Most T/F viruses use CCR5 to infect target cells and some encode envelope glycoproteins (Envs) that contain fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites and shorter V1/V2 variable loops than Envs from chronic viruses. Moreover, it has been reported that the gp120 subunits of certain transmitted Envs bind to the gut-homing integrin α4β7, possibly enhancing virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. Here we sought to determine whether subtype C T/F viruses, which are responsible for the majority of new HIV-1 infections worldwide, share biological properties that increase their transmission fitness, including preferential α4β7 engagement. Using single genome amplification, we generated panels of both T/F (n = 20) and chronic (n = 20) Env constructs as well as full-length T/F (n = 6) and chronic (n = 4) infectious molecular clones (IMCs). We found that T/F and chronic control Envs were indistinguishable in the efficiency with which they used CD4 and CCR5. Both groups of Envs also exhibited the same CD4+ T cell subset tropism and showed similar sensitivity to neutralization by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies. Finally, saturating concentrations of anti-α4β7 antibodies failed to inhibit infection and replication of T/F as well as chronic control viruses, although the growth of the tissue culture-adapted strain …",Nicholas F Parrish and Craig B Wilen and Lauren B Banks and Shilpa S Iyer and Jennifer M Pfaff and Jesus F Salazar-Gonzalez and Maria G Salazar and Julie M Decker and Erica H Parrish and Anna Berg and Jennifer Hopper and Bhavna Hora and Amit Kumar and Tatenda Mahlokozera and Sally Yuan and Charl Coleman and Marion Vermeulen and Haitao Ding and Christina Ochsenbauer and John C Tilton and Sallie R Permar and John C Kappes and Michael R Betts and Michael P Busch and Feng Gao and David Montefiori and Barton F Haynes and George M Shaw and Beatrice H Hahn and Robert W Doms,162,11831440973651308959,PLoS Pathog,5,e1002686,Public Library of Science,Transmitted/founder and chronic subtype C HIV-1 use CD4 and CCR5 receptors with equal efficiency and are not inhibited by blocking the integrin α4β7,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002686,8,2012,/scholar?cites=11831440973651308959,11F_c5oAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC
2073,"HIV-infected individuals maintaining undetectable viremia in the absence of therapy (HIV controllers) often maintain high HIV-specific T cell responses, which has spurred the development of vaccines eliciting HIV-specific T cell responses. However, controllers also often have abnormally high T cell activation levels, potentially contributing to T cell dysfunction, CD4+ T cell depletion, and non-AIDS morbidity. We hypothesized that a weak T regulatory cell (Treg) response might contribute to the control of viral replication in HIV controllers, but might also contribute to generalized immune activation, contributing to CD4+ T cell loss. To address these hypotheses, we measured frequencies of activated (CD38+ HLA-DR+), regulatory (CD4+CD25+CD127dim), HIV-specific, and CMV-specific T cells among HIV controllers and 3 control populations: HIV-infected individuals with treatment-mediated viral suppression (ART-suppressed), untreated HIV-infected “non-controllers” with high levels of viremia, and HIV-uninfected individuals. Despite abnormally high T cell activation levels, controllers had lower Treg frequencies than HIV-uninfected controls (P = 0.014). Supporting the propensity for an unusually low Treg response to viral infection in HIV controllers, we observed unusually high CMV-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies and a strong correlation between HIV-specific CD4+ T cell responses and generalized CD8+ T cell activation levels in HIV controllers (P≤0.001).

2089,"Viral testing using nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) was initiated in 1995 by the European plasma industry. This raised the question of the relevance of NAT testing of blood donations, in reinforcing the safety of the blood supply, by detecting acute viral infections in the ‘window phase'that were not detected by current licensed serological screening methods. The first Blood Centre to introduce NAT testing as a measure of quality control for solvent/detergent (SD)-inactivated plasma was Northrhein–Westphalia (Germany), in 1995. Initially, three viral genomes [hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)] were tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a private laboratory and thereafter by using an in-house PCR at the Blood Center in Frankfurt. Subsequently, other European countries have implemented NAT for blood screening.In order to obtain information on this important new development in blood screening, an International Forum was organized in 2002 [1]. A questionnaire was sent to experts in the field, and the results showed that in most high-income countries, NAT had already been implemented. At that time, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was the greatest concern, and consequently 11 countries (the USA, Australia, Japan, Finland, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland), including eight in Europe, had given priority to HCV NAT.

2117,"BACKGROUND: Calculations of the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the blood donor setting that are based solely on data for seroconversion to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) will underestimate the incidence due to the transient nature of antigenemia. Estimates based on antibody to hepatitis B core antigen will overestimate the incidence due to false‐positive results caused by the nonspecificity of the test. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serologic test results were obtained from multiple‐time volunteer donors at five United States blood centers from January 1991 through December 1993.

Here, we investigate the kinetics and viral epitopes targeted by T cells responding to ZIKV and address the critical question of whether preexisting dengue virus (DENV) T cell immunity modulates these responses. We find that memory T cell responses elicited by prior infection with DENV or vaccination with tetravalent dengue attenuated vaccines (TDLAV) recognize ZIKV-derived peptides. This cross-reactivity is explained by the sequence similarity of the two viruses, as the ZIKV peptides recognized by DENV-elicited memory T cells are identical or highly conserved in DENV and ZIKV.

2207,"Background Current laboratory and point-of-care tests for HIV detect different analytes and use different sample types. Some have fast turnaround times (<1 hour). We investigated how HIV test choice could impact case finding by testing programs.  Methods We analyzed 21,234 consecutive HIV tests with venous blood obtained by San Francisco HIV testing programs from 2003 to 2008. For a subset, oral fluid (n = 6446) or fingerstick blood (n = 8127) samples were also obtained for rapid testing. In all cases, HIV status was determined using an HIV antibody-plus-RNA test algorithm. We assessed how the screening antibody tests performed individually versus the gold standard of the full algorithm. We then evaluated the potential ability of other tests (including new tests) to detect more cases, by re-testing all specimens that had negative/discrepant antibody results on initial screening.  Findings The antibody-RNA algorithm identified 58 acute and 703 established HIV infection cases. 1st-generation (Vironostika) and 3rd-generation (Genetic Systems) immunoassays had 92 and 96 percent sensitivity, respectively. The Oraquick rapid test had clinical sensitivity of only 86 percent on oral fluid samples, but 92 percent on finger-stick blood. Newer 4th-generation, antigen-antibody combo rapid immunoassay (ARCHITECT) detected HIV in 87 percent of all the acute cases that had been missed by one of the previous screening assays.

2221,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause severe defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by sexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual transmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual transmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of vaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation with 104–106 plaque-forming units (PFU). However, there was variability in susceptibility between the individual RM with 1–>8 vaginal inoculations required to establish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used contraceptive progestin, two RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV inoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus, Depoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV transmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and dissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly different from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus inoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV inoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less common in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female reproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally inoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV replication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6 animals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding from FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma vRNA, and persisted for at least as long.

Furthermore, we extract topic-specific influence backbone structures based on content adoption and show that their structure differs significantly from the static follower network.

Microchimerism can also occur after allogeneic blood transfusion in traumatically injured patients, where donor cells have been observed decades after transfusion. To date, transfusion-associated microchimerism (TA-MC) appears confined to this clinical subset, most likely due to the immune perturbations that occur after severe trauma that allow foreign donor cells to survive. Transfusion-associated microchimerism appears to be unaffected by leukoreduction and has been documented after transfusion with an array of blood products.

Yet, the political and media focus on HIV and the blood supply remains intense. There are strong pressures to do everything conceivable to further reduce the risk of acquiring HIV from transfusions. In response, behavioral scientists have proposed new donor selection and screening procedures, reagent manufacturers have developed new tests for narrowing the seronegative window period following infection, and development continues on viral inactivation procedures, particularly for cellular blood components. Unfortunately, development of sound approaches for evaluating the need for, and utility of, proposed new measures has not kept pace with the cries for action or the advances in technology.

The sample was negative for HCV RNA by several PCR assays using both standard and enhanced sample concentration and extracting methods with theoretical detection limits of 4 to 12 geq per mL.

2358,"Background West Nile virus (WNV) infection is asymptomatic in most individuals, with a minority developing symptoms ranging from WNV fever to serious neuroinvasive disease. This study investigated the impact of host HLA on the outcome of WNV disease.   Methods A cohort of 210 non-Hispanic mostly white WNV+ subjects from Canada and the U.S. were typed for HLA-A, B, C, DP, DQ, and DR. The study subjects were divided into three WNV infection outcome groups: asymptomatic (AS), symptomatic (S), and neuroinvasive disease (ND). Allele frequency distribution was compared pair-wise between the AS, S, and ND groups using χ2 and Fisher's exact tests and P values were corrected for multiple comparisons (Pc). Allele frequencies were compared between the groups and the North American population (NA) used as a control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the potential synergistic effect of age and HLA allele phenotype on disease outcome.   Results The alleles HLA-A*68, C*08 and DQB*05 were more frequently associated with severe outcomes (ND vs. AS, PA*68 = 0.013/Pc = 0.26, PC*08 = 0.0075/Pc = 0.064, and PDQB1*05 = 0.029/Pc = 0.68), However the apparent DQB1*05 association was driven by age.

The major motivation for introduction of anti-HBc screening was data from posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) cohort studies that documented the value of anti-HBc as a surrogate marker for non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). It was also recognized at that time that anti-HBc screening could potentially detect HBsAg-negative donors implicated in rare residual PTHBV cases, as well as reduce the risk of HIV transmission by unscreened (prior to 1985) or anti-HIV screened units.

The models include a tunable parameter that controls an individual's relative weighting of attraction and alignment. We perform computational experiments to investigate how effectively simulated groups transfer information in the form of velocity when an individual is perturbed. A cross-correlation function is used to measure the sensitivity of groups to sudden perturbations in the heading of individual members. The results show how relative weighting of attraction and alignment, location of the perturbed individual, population size, and the communication topology affect group structure and response to perturbation.

2413,"Background The findings of frequent circulation of HIV-1 subclade F1 viruses and the scarcity of BF1 recombinant viruses based on pol subgenomic fragment sequencing among blood donors in Pernambuco (PE), Northeast of Brazil, were reported recently. Here, we aimed to determine whether the classification of these strains (n = 26) extends to the whole genome sequences.  Methods Five overlapping amplicons spanning the HIV near full-length genomes (NFLGs) were PCR amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 26 blood donors. The amplicons were molecularly bar-coded, pooled, and sequenced by Illumina paired-end protocol. The prevalence of viral variants containing drug resistant mutations (DRMs) was compared between plasma and PBMCs.  Results Of the 26 samples studied, 20 NFLGs and 4 partial fragments were de novo assembled into contiguous sequences and successfully subtyped. Two distinct BF1 recombinant profiles designated CRF70_BF1 and CRF71_BF1, with 4 samples in profile I and 11 in profile II were detected and thus constitute two novel recombinant forms circulating in PE. Evidence of dual infections was detected in four patients co-infected with distinct HIV-1 subtypes. According to our estimate, the new CRF71_BF1 accounts for 10% of the HIV-1 circulating strains among blood donors in PE. Discordant data between the plasma and PBMCs-virus were found in 15 of 24 donors. Six of these strains displayed major DRMs only in PBMCs and four of which had detectable DRMs changes at prevalence between 1-20% of the sequenced population.

2422,A genetic analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in rare blood donors who remained HCV seronegative despite long-term high-level viremia revealed the chronic presence of HCV genomes with large in frame deletions in their structural genes. Full-length HCV genomes were only detected as minority variants. In one immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected donor the truncated HCV genome transiently decreased in frequency concomitant with delayed seroconversion and re-emerged following partial seroreversion. The long-term production of heavily truncated HCV genomes in vivo suggests that these viruses retained the necessary elements for RNA replication while the deleted structural functions necessary for their spread in vivo was provided in trans by wild-type helper virus in co-infected cells.

2429,"Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is prevalent and often causes hepatic fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and cause liver cancer or liver failure. Study of fibrosis progression often relies on imputing the time of infection, often as the reported age of first injection drug use. We sought to examine the accuracy of such imputation and implications for modeling factors that influence progression rates. We analyzed cross-sectional data on hepatitis C antibody status and reported risk factor histories from two large studies, the Women's Interagency HIV Study and the Urban Health Study, using modern survival analysis methods for current status data to model past infection risk year by year. We compared fitted distributions of past infection risk to reported age of first injection drug use. Although injection drug use appeared to be a very strong risk factor, models for both studies showed that many subjects had considerable probability of having been infected substantially before or after their reported age of first injection drug use. Persons reporting younger age of first injection drug use were more likely to have been infected after, and persons reporting older age of first injection drug use were more likely to have been infected before. In cross-sectional studies of fibrosis progression where date of HCV infection is estimated from risk factor histories, modern methods such as multiple imputation should be used to account for the substantial uncertainty about when infection occurred.

2452,"Background. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only known cure for a variety of inherited diseases and requires the administration of high doses of immunosuppressive and myeloablative therapy. Because the fetus is immunoincompetent early in gestation, in utero stem cell transplantation (IUT) could avoid the need for this toxic conditioning. A major limitation to date of IUT is the low level of engraftment and failure to induce tolerance.

2478,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, the causative agent of Chagas disease, infects about six million individuals in more than 20 countries. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is of utmost importance to develop and evaluate treatments to control the disease. Routine screening for infected human individuals is achieved by serological assays; PCR testing to monitor spontaneous or therapy-induced parasitological cure has limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a newly developed antibody profiling assay as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on waning of antibody following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection.   Methodology/Principal findings We designed a multiplex serology assay, an array of fifteen optimized T. cruzi antigens, to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One specific antibody response (antibody 3, Ab3) showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signal was strongly associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, whereas significant and progressive decline in Ab3 signals was observed in BZN-treated patients who cleared parasitemia based on blood PCR results.   Conclusion/Significance Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients.

We conducted a survey of clinical practice of prognostication after therapeutic hypothermia (TH) became common practice in Norway. By telephone, we interviewed the consultants who were in charge of the 25 ICUs admitting cardiac patients using 6 structured questions regarding timing, tests used and medical specialties involved in prognostication, as well as the clinical importance of the different parameters used and the application of TH in these patients. Prognostication was conducted within 24–48 hours in the majority (72%) of the participating ICUs. The most commonly applied parameters and tests were a clinical neurological examination (100%), prehospital data (76%), CCT (56%) and EEG (52%). The parameters and tests considered to be of greatest importance for accurate prognostication were prehospital data (56%), neurological examination (52%), and EEG (20%). In 76% of the ICUs, a multidisciplinary approach to prognostication was applied, but only one ICU used a standardised protocol. Therapeutic hypothermia was in routine use in 80% of the surveyed ICUs. Despite the routine use of TH, outcome prediction was performed early and was mainly based on prehospital information, neurological examination and CCT and EEG evaluation.

2522,"Many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals suffer from persistent immune activation. Chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation have been associated with an increased risk of age-related diseases even among patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. The factors leading to immune activation are complex, but have been hypothesized to include persistent viral replication with cellular death as well as microbial translocation across the gastrointestinal tract. Both processes may trigger innate immune responses since many native molecules released from dying cells are similar in structure to pathogen associated molecular patterns. These damage associated molecular patterns include mitochondrial DNA and formylated peptides. We hypothesized that circulating mitochondrial nucleic acid could serve as a biomarker for HIV-associated cell death and drive innate immune activation in infected individuals. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for plasma mitochondrial DNA and validated it on normal blood donors. We then measured mitochondrial DNA levels in acute and chronic HIV infection. While the assay proved to be accurate with a robust dynamic range, we did not find a significant association between HIV disease status and circulating mitochondrial DNA.

Because NF-kappa B is also expressed in resting B cells we suggested that B cells might provide an optimal intracellular environment for HIV-1 transcription. Using a transient transfection assay, we show that the HIV-1 LTR is indeed more efficiently transcribed in the B cell line Raji than in the T cell line Jurkat, and that this effect maps to the transcriptional enhancer (NF-kappa B binding site) of the LTR. Furthermore, we show that Raji cells which have been rendered CD4-positive by gene transfection are susceptible to HIV-1 infection, and that viral gene expression and replication are more efficient in these CD4-positive B cells than in CD4-positive T cells. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of the transcriptional enhancer in regulating HIV-1 expression and, since receptors for HIV-1 are expressed by some Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B cells, they also suggest that HIV-1 replication could occur in EBV-positive B cells in vivo.",AF Calman and MP Busch and GN Vyas and TM McHugh and DP Stites and BM Peterlin,16,3586251033198568498,"AIDS (London, England)",3,185-193,,Transcription and replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 in B lymphocytes in vitro.,https://europepmc.org/article/med/2840098,2,1988,/scholar?cites=3586251033198568498,11F_c5oAAAAJ:7Hz3ACDFbsoC

2536,BackgroundThe mechanisms of HIV transmission from mothers to infants are poorly understood. A possible mechanism of in utero transmission is transplacental transfer of HIV-infected maternal leukocytes into the fetal circulation during pregnancy.ObjectiveTo determine if the frequency of in utero HIV infection correlates with presence or levels of maternal cells (MC) in placenta-derived cord blood.MethodsDNA was extracted from dried cord blood spots (DBS) from newborns born to HIV+ mothers and corresponding maternal DBS specimens. Paired mother-infant samples were probed to identify unique maternal sequences targeted by 24 allele-specific real-time PCR assays. Infant DBS-derived DNA was then probed in replicate analyses for non-inherited maternal allelic-sequences.

2549,"Since the first antibody tests for the diagnosis of hu-man immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1985, many “new and improved” HIV screening and diagnostic tests have been developed, and a variety of testing algorithms have come into use. HIV antibody tests have evolved from first generation HIV-1 (clade B) viral lysate-based, indirect antibody enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to third generation antigen-sandwich immunoassays that use synthetic peptide and recombinant DNA-derived antigens that represent the immunodominant epitopes from diverse HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains. These third generation enzyme immunoassays have substantially enhanced sensitivity to divergent viral variants and have shortened the infection-to-seroconversion window period by more than 3 weeks compared with first generation tests. Assays have also been developed that detect and quantitate viral antigen (p24) and nucleic acids (HIV RNA or DNA) in blood, and in body fluids and tissues.

2565,"BACKGROUNDDecisions regarding addition (or discontinuation) of donor screening tests must be based on accurate estimates for the residual risk of transmission of each agent by transfusions and the capacity of tests under consideration to reduce (or increase) these risks. The risks of acquiring a major viral infection (eg, HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)) from contemporary screened transfusions are now so low that classic approaches for estimating the residual risks are no longer feasible. These approaches include (1) investigation of clinically identified posttransfusion cases,(2) prospective follow-up of recipients to document Seroconversion, and (3) special laboratory studies of seronegative donor specimens to detect missed infections. My colleagues and I have developed a new approach for estimating the residual risk of virus transmission associated with infectious, seroconverting, window-period donations. The approach is based on combining estimates of the incidence rate of infection among repeat donors with estimates for the duration of the preseroconversion window period for each agent, thus deriving the rate of missed, window-phase donations. Similarly, data on the capacity of a new test to reduce the infectious window period can be combined with the incidence rate for that agent to estimate the net yield and incremental reduction in risk that would be achieved by routine implementation of the test.",MP Bush,13,12445281025731074206,"Program and Abstracts of the National Institutes of Health Development Conference.

Biopsy-confirmed rejection, the current gold standard for diagnosis of allograft rejection, is invasive and subject to sampling errors. For example, diagnosis of episodes of rejection of pancreas allografts, which are frequent and can destroy the allograft, depends on conventional percutaneous biopsies that have a diagnostic sensitivity of only 79%–88%(1, 2) and are associated with a 2%–7% risk of serious complications (3). Development of noninvasive assays that detect molecular biomarkers for rejection could revolutionize management of transplant recipients by (a) detecting a prerejection profile that will allow therapeutic interventions before rejection causes graft dysfunction;(b) improving the sensitivity and specificity of rejection diagnosis;(c) developing new …",Lee Ann Baxter-Lowe and Michael P Busch,12,16442335261615716420,,4,559-561,Oxford University Press,Tracking microchimeric DNA in plasma to diagnose and manage organ transplant rejection,https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article-abstract/52/4/559/5626949,52,2006,/scholar?cites=16442335261615716420,11F_c5oAAAAJ:prdVHNxh-e8C

2579,"Rates of HIV-1 progression vary widely. To investigate the relative effects of viral and host characteristics on course, we compared persons infected by the same and different subtype B strains. Forty-three infection chain clusters were identified, each defined by an infected blood donor, that donor's recipients, and the recipients' sexual partners, representing second and third generations of infection. Analysis of levels and rates of change in CD4 lymphocyte counts and viral load showed that members within a cluster were no more alike in their rates of change in CD4+ lymphocyte counts or viral RNA levels than among clusters. Differences in entry viral RNA levels by cluster were marginal and markedly smaller than interindividual differences.

2582,"We assessed the immunopathologic role of circulating immune complexes in human immunodeficiency virus infection by evaluating the data base and the serum bank of the San Francisco Men's Health Study, a longitudinal clinical and epidemiological investigation conducted since 1983. A group of 4,276 sera from 1,023 (including 811 homosexual/bisexual) men were tested for circulating immune complexes. We used a modification of the commercially available enzyme immunoassay test, based on monoclonal anti-C1q antibodies coupled to the solid phase, for capturing circulating immune complexes from the test serum, followed by detection of circulating immune complexes with either anti-IgG or with anti-IgM probes. Although persistent IgM and IgG circulating immune complexes were most frequently encountered in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive homosexual/bisexual men, they were not an indicator of disease progression as assessed by abnormalities in the absolute numbers or ratios of CD4-and CD8-positive T cells, or clinical signs and symptoms of AIDS/ARC.",S Roy and WJ Morrow and C Christian and H Khayam-Bashi and MP Busch and R McCarthy and RP Rodgers and GN Vyas,12,10281447068299994924,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,2,134-138,,Persistent immune complexes and abnormal CD4/CD8 ratios in HIV infection.,https://europepmc.org/article/med/1967308,3,1990,/scholar?cites=10281447068299994924,11F_c5oAAAAJ:sszUF3NjhM4C
2583,"Quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOA) use limiting dilutions of CD4+ T cells to measure the size of the latent HIV-1 reservoir, a major obstacle to curing HIV-1. Efforts to reduce the reservoir require assays that can reliably quantify its size in blood and tissues. Although QVOA is regarded as a “gold standard” for reservoir measurement, little is known about its accuracy and precision or about how cell storage conditions or laboratory-specific practices affect results. Owing to this lack of knowledge, confidence intervals around reservoir size estimates—as well as judgments of the ability of therapeutic interventions to alter the size of the replication-competent but transcriptionally inactive latent reservoir—rely on theoretical statistical assumptions about dilution assays. To address this gap, we have carried out a Bayesian statistical analysis of QVOA reliability on 75 split samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 5 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed participants, measured using four different QVOAs at separate labs, estimating assay precision and the effect of frozen cell storage on estimated reservoir size. We found that typical assay results are expected to differ from the true value by a factor of 1.6 to 1.9 up or down. Systematic assay differences comprised a 24-fold range between the assays with highest and lowest scales, likely reflecting differences in viral outgrowth readout and input cell stimulation protocols. We also found that controlled-rate freezing and storage of samples did not cause substantial differences in QVOA compared to use of fresh cells (95% probability of < 2-fold change), supporting continued use of frozen …",Daniel IS Rosenbloom and Peter Bacchetti and Mars Stone and Xutao Deng and Ronald J Bosch and Douglas D Richman and Janet D Siliciano and John W Mellors and Steven G Deeks and Roger G Ptak and Rebecca Hoh and Sheila M Keating and Melanie Dimapasoc and Marta Massanella and Jun Lai and Michele D Sobolewski and Deanna A Kulpa and Michael P Busch and Reservoir Assay Validation and Evaluation Network (RAVEN) Study Group,11,18248683584302292168,PLoS computational biology,4,e1006849,Public Library of Science,Assessing intra-lab precision and inter-lab repeatability of outgrowth assays of HIV-1 latent reservoir size,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006849,15,2019,/scholar?cites=18248683584302292168,11F_c5oAAAAJ:gPamCmV4epEC
2584,"The 2012 West Nile virus (WNV) epidemic was the largest since 2003 and the North Texas region was the most heavily impacted. We conducted a serosurvey of blood donors from four counties in the Dallas–Fort Worth area to characterize the epidemic. Blood donor specimens collected in November 2012 were tested for WNV-specific antibodies. Donors positive for WNV-specific IgG, IgM, and neutralizing antibodies were considered to have been infected in 2012. This number was adjusted using a multi-step process that accounted for timing of IgM seroreversion determined from previous longitudinal studies of WNV-infected donors. Of 4971 donations screened, 139 (2·8%) were confirmed WNV IgG positive, and 69 (1·4%) had IgM indicating infection in 2012.
