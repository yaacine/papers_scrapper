4000,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, with estimates of 4 million HCV-infected individuals in the United States and 170 million worldwide 1. Most (70–80%) HCV infections persist and about 30% of individuals with persistent infection develop chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 2. Epidemiological, viral and host factors have been associated with the differences in HCV clearance or persistence, and studies have demonstrated that a strong host immune response against HCV favours viral clearance 3, 4. Thus, variation in genes involved in the immune response may contribute to the ability to clear the virus. In a recent genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs12979860) 3 kilobases upstream of the IL28B gene, which encodes the type III interferon IFN-λ3, was shown to associate strongly with more …",David L Thomas and Chloe L Thio and Maureen P Martin and Ying Qi and Dongliang Ge and Colm O’hUigin and Judith Kidd and Kenneth Kidd and Salim I Khakoo and Graeme Alexander and James J Goedert and Gregory D Kirk and Sharyne M Donfield and Hugo R Rosen and Leslie H Tobler and Michael P Busch and John G McHutchison and David B Goldstein and Mary Carrington,2398,17515851486538407948,Nature,7265,798-801,Nature Publishing Group,Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08463,461,2009,/scholar?cites=17515851486538407948,11F_c5oAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC

4007,"As the immune system develops, T cells are selected or regulated to become tolerant of self antigens and reactive against foreign antigens. In mice, the induction of such tolerance is thought to be attributable to the deletion of self-reactive cells. Here, we show that the human fetal immune system takes advantage of an additional mechanism: the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress fetal immune responses. We find that substantial numbers of maternal cells cross the placenta to reside in fetal lymph nodes, inducing the development of CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ Tregs that suppress fetal antimaternal immunity and persist at least until early adulthood.

4035,"As the safety of blood transfusion has dramati-cally improved with respect to transmission of viral infection, one of the remaining challenges has been to accurately estimate the risk (termed the residual risk) of transfusion-transmitted viral infection for those viruses (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis C virus [HCV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]) for which donor screening is routinely performed. The basic tool applied to this task has been mathematical modeling, with the most commonly used model being the incidence rate–window period (I-WP) model. Originally developed in the mid-1990s, this model has been accepted as a valid and accurate approach by blood bankers and regulators around the world and it has widely been used by many international investigators to generate country specific residual risk estimates. 1-6 An understanding of the relationship between viral load and infectivity is important for calculating the residual risk of infection using the I-WP model.

We sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of TDR and to identify the HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations responsible for TDR in different regions and virus subtypes.   Methods and Findings We reviewed all GenBank submissions of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences with or without protease and identified 287 studies published between March 1, 2000, and December 31, 2013, with more than 25 recently or chronically infected ARV-naïve individuals. These studies comprised 50,870 individuals from 111 countries. Each set of study sequences was analyzed for phylogenetic clustering and the presence of 93 surveillance drug-resistance mutations (SDRMs).

The primary reason is that the donor has negative laboratory test results during the early stages of infection, known as the window period.

The processes that promote inflammation and encephalitis within the CNS are important for control of WNV disease but, how inflammatory signaling pathways operate to control CNS infection is not defined. Here, we identify IL-1β signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome as key host restriction factors involved in viral control and CNS disease associated with WNV infection. Individuals presenting with acute WNV infection displayed elevated levels of IL-1β in their plasma over the course of infection, suggesting a role for IL-1β in WNV immunity. Indeed, we found that in a mouse model of infection, WNV induced the acute production of IL-1β in vivo, and that animals lacking the IL-1 receptor or components involved in inflammasome signaling complex exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV pathogenesis. This outcome associated with increased accumulation of virus within the CNS but not peripheral tissues and was further associated with altered kinetics and magnitude of inflammation, reduced quality of the effector CD8+ T cell response and reduced anti-viral activity within the CNS. Importantly, we found that WNV infection triggers production of IL-1β from cortical neurons. Furthermore, we found that IL-1β signaling synergizes with type I IFN to suppress WNV replication in neurons, thus implicating antiviral activity of IL-1β within neurons and control of virus replication within the CNS.

4072,"Sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) most often results from productive infection by a single transmitted/founder (T/F) virus, indicating a stringent mucosal bottleneck. Understanding the viral traits that overcome this bottleneck could have important implications for HIV-1 vaccine design and other prevention strategies. Most T/F viruses use CCR5 to infect target cells and some encode envelope glycoproteins (Envs) that contain fewer potential N-linked glycosylation sites and shorter V1/V2 variable loops than Envs from chronic viruses. Moreover, it has been reported that the gp120 subunits of certain transmitted Envs bind to the gut-homing integrin α4β7, possibly enhancing virus entry and cell-to-cell spread. Here we sought to determine whether subtype C T/F viruses, which are responsible for the majority of new HIV-1 infections worldwide, share biological properties that increase their transmission fitness, including preferential α4β7 engagement. Using single genome amplification, we generated panels of both T/F (n = 20) and chronic (n = 20) Env constructs as well as full-length T/F (n = 6) and chronic (n = 4) infectious molecular clones (IMCs). We found that T/F and chronic control Envs were indistinguishable in the efficiency with which they used CD4 and CCR5. Both groups of Envs also exhibited the same CD4+ T cell subset tropism and showed similar sensitivity to neutralization by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies. Finally, saturating concentrations of anti-α4β7 antibodies failed to inhibit infection and replication of T/F as well as chronic control viruses, although the growth of the tissue culture-adapted strain …",Nicholas F Parrish and Craig B Wilen and Lauren B Banks and Shilpa S Iyer and Jennifer M Pfaff and Jesus F Salazar-Gonzalez and Maria G Salazar and Julie M Decker and Erica H Parrish and Anna Berg and Jennifer Hopper and Bhavna Hora and Amit Kumar and Tatenda Mahlokozera and Sally Yuan and Charl Coleman and Marion Vermeulen and Haitao Ding and Christina Ochsenbauer and John C Tilton and Sallie R Permar and John C Kappes and Michael R Betts and Michael P Busch and Feng Gao and David Montefiori and Barton F Haynes and George M Shaw and Beatrice H Hahn and Robert W Doms,162,11831440973651308959,PLoS Pathog,5,e1002686,Public Library of Science,Transmitted/founder and chronic subtype C HIV-1 use CD4 and CCR5 receptors with equal efficiency and are not inhibited by blocking the integrin α4β7,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002686,8,2012,/scholar?cites=11831440973651308959,11F_c5oAAAAJ:OU6Ihb5iCvQC
4073,"HIV-infected individuals maintaining undetectable viremia in the absence of therapy (HIV controllers) often maintain high HIV-specific T cell responses, which has spurred the development of vaccines eliciting HIV-specific T cell responses. However, controllers also often have abnormally high T cell activation levels, potentially contributing to T cell dysfunction, CD4+ T cell depletion, and non-AIDS morbidity. We hypothesized that a weak T regulatory cell (Treg) response might contribute to the control of viral replication in HIV controllers, but might also contribute to generalized immune activation, contributing to CD4+ T cell loss. To address these hypotheses, we measured frequencies of activated (CD38+ HLA-DR+), regulatory (CD4+CD25+CD127dim), HIV-specific, and CMV-specific T cells among HIV controllers and 3 control populations: HIV-infected individuals with treatment-mediated viral suppression (ART-suppressed), untreated HIV-infected “non-controllers” with high levels of viremia, and HIV-uninfected individuals. Despite abnormally high T cell activation levels, controllers had lower Treg frequencies than HIV-uninfected controls (P = 0.014). Supporting the propensity for an unusually low Treg response to viral infection in HIV controllers, we observed unusually high CMV-specific CD4+ T cell frequencies and a strong correlation between HIV-specific CD4+ T cell responses and generalized CD8+ T cell activation levels in HIV controllers (P≤0.001).

4088,"Viral testing using nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) was initiated in 1995 by the European plasma industry. This raised the question of the relevance of NAT testing of blood donations, in reinforcing the safety of the blood supply, by detecting acute viral infections in the ‘window phase'that were not detected by current licensed serological screening methods. The first Blood Centre to introduce NAT testing as a measure of quality control for solvent/detergent (SD)-inactivated plasma was Northrhein–Westphalia (Germany), in 1995. Initially, three viral genomes [hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)] were tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a private laboratory and thereafter by using an in-house PCR at the Blood Center in Frankfurt. Subsequently, other European countries have implemented NAT for blood screening.In order to obtain information on this important new development in blood screening, an International Forum was organized in 2002 [1]. A questionnaire was sent to experts in the field, and the results showed that in most high-income countries, NAT had already been implemented. At that time, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was the greatest concern, and consequently 11 countries (the USA, Australia, Japan, Finland, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland), including eight in Europe, had given priority to HCV NAT.

4117,"BACKGROUND: Calculations of the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the blood donor setting that are based solely on data for seroconversion to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) will underestimate the incidence due to the transient nature of antigenemia. Estimates based on antibody to hepatitis B core antigen will overestimate the incidence due to false‐positive results caused by the nonspecificity of the test.

Here, we investigate the kinetics and viral epitopes targeted by T cells responding to ZIKV and address the critical question of whether preexisting dengue virus (DENV) T cell immunity modulates these responses. We find that memory T cell responses elicited by prior infection with DENV or vaccination with tetravalent dengue attenuated vaccines (TDLAV) recognize ZIKV-derived peptides. This cross-reactivity is explained by the sequence similarity of the two viruses, as the ZIKV peptides recognized by DENV-elicited memory T cells are identical or highly conserved in DENV and ZIKV.

We investigated how HIV test choice could impact case finding by testing programs.  Methods We analyzed 21,234 consecutive HIV tests with venous blood obtained by San Francisco HIV testing programs from 2003 to 2008. For a subset, oral fluid (n = 6446) or fingerstick blood (n = 8127) samples were also obtained for rapid testing. In all cases, HIV status was determined using an HIV antibody-plus-RNA test algorithm. We assessed how the screening antibody tests performed individually versus the gold standard of the full algorithm. We then evaluated the potential ability of other tests (including new tests) to detect more cases, by re-testing all specimens that had negative/discrepant antibody results on initial screening.  Findings The antibody-RNA algorithm identified 58 acute and 703 established HIV infection cases. 1st-generation (Vironostika) and 3rd-generation (Genetic Systems) immunoassays had 92 and 96 percent sensitivity, respectively. The Oraquick rapid test had clinical sensitivity of only 86 percent on oral fluid samples, but 92 percent on finger-stick blood. Newer 4th-generation, antigen-antibody combo rapid immunoassay (ARCHITECT) detected HIV in 87 percent of all the acute cases that had been missed by one of the previous screening assays.

4221,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause severe defects in an infected fetus. ZIKV is also transmitted by sexual contact, although the relative importance of sexual transmission is unclear. To better understand the role of sexual transmission in ZIKV pathogenesis, a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of vaginal transmission was developed. ZIKV was readily transmitted to mature cycling female rhesus macaque (RM) by vaginal inoculation with 104–106 plaque-forming units (PFU). However, there was variability in susceptibility between the individual RM with 1–>8 vaginal inoculations required to establish infection. After treatment with Depoprovera, a widely used contraceptive progestin, two RM that initially resisted 8 vaginal ZIKV inoculations became infected after one ZIKV inoculation. Thus, Depoprovera seemed to enhance susceptibility to vaginal ZIKV transmission. Unexpectedly, the kinetics of virus replication and dissemination after intravaginal ZIKV inoculation were markedly different from RM infected with ZIKV by subcutaneous (SQ) virus inoculation. Several groups have reported that after SQ ZIKV inoculation vRNA is rapidly detected in blood plasma with vRNA less common in urine and saliva and only rarely detected in female reproductive tract (FRT) secretions. In contrast, in vaginally inoculated RM, plasma vRNA is delayed for several days and ZIKV replication in, and vRNA shedding from, the FRT was found in all 6 animals. Further, after intravaginal transmission ZIKV RNA shedding from FRT secretions was detected before or simultaneously with plasma vRNA, and persisted for at least as long.

Hence, novel models incorporating dynamic user behavior are needed. To this end, we propose a model for individual social media users, termed a genotype. The genotype is a per-topic summary of a user’s interest, activity and susceptibility to adopt new information. We demonstrate that user genotypes remain invariant within a topic by adopting them for classification of new information spread in large-scale real networks. Furthermore, we extract topic-specific influence backbone structures based on content adoption and show that their structure differs significantly from the static follower network.

Microchimerism can also occur after allogeneic blood transfusion in traumatically injured patients, where donor cells have been observed decades after transfusion. To date, transfusion-associated microchimerism (TA-MC) appears confined to this clinical subset, most likely due to the immune perturbations that occur after severe trauma that allow foreign donor cells to survive. Transfusion-associated microchimerism appears to be unaffected by leukoreduction and has been documented after transfusion with an array of blood products.

Yet, the political and media focus on HIV and the blood supply remains intense. There are strong pressures to do everything conceivable to further reduce the risk of acquiring HIV from transfusions. In response, behavioral scientists have proposed new donor selection and screening procedures, reagent manufacturers have developed new tests for narrowing the seronegative window period following infection, and development continues on viral inactivation procedures, particularly for cellular blood components. Unfortunately, development of sound approaches for evaluating the need for, and utility of, proposed new measures has not kept pace with the cries for action or the advances in technology.

This study investigated the impact of host HLA on the outcome of WNV disease.   Methods A cohort of 210 non-Hispanic mostly white WNV+ subjects from Canada and the U.S. were typed for HLA-A, B, C, DP, DQ, and DR. The study subjects were divided into three WNV infection outcome groups: asymptomatic (AS), symptomatic (S), and neuroinvasive disease (ND). Allele frequency distribution was compared pair-wise between the AS, S, and ND groups using χ2 and Fisher's exact tests and P values were corrected for multiple comparisons (Pc). Allele frequencies were compared between the groups and the North American population (NA) used as a control group. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the potential synergistic effect of age and HLA allele phenotype on disease outcome.   Results The alleles HLA-A*68, C*08 and DQB*05 were more frequently associated with severe outcomes (ND vs. AS, PA*68 = 0.013/Pc = 0.26, PC*08 = 0.0075/Pc = 0.064, and PDQB1*05 = 0.029/Pc = 0.68), However the apparent DQB1*05 association was driven by age.

The models include a tunable parameter that controls an individual's relative weighting of attraction and alignment. We perform computational experiments to investigate how effectively simulated groups transfer information in the form of velocity when an individual is perturbed. A cross-correlation function is used to measure the sensitivity of groups to sudden perturbations in the heading of individual members. The results show how relative weighting of attraction and alignment, location of the perturbed individual, population size, and the communication topology affect group structure and response to perturbation.

4413,"Background The findings of frequent circulation of HIV-1 subclade F1 viruses and the scarcity of BF1 recombinant viruses based on pol subgenomic fragment sequencing among blood donors in Pernambuco (PE), Northeast of Brazil, were reported recently. Here, we aimed to determine whether the classification of these strains (n = 26) extends to the whole genome sequences.  Methods Five overlapping amplicons spanning the HIV near full-length genomes (NFLGs) were PCR amplified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 26 blood donors. The amplicons were molecularly bar-coded, pooled, and sequenced by Illumina paired-end protocol. The prevalence of viral variants containing drug resistant mutations (DRMs) was compared between plasma and PBMCs.  Results Of the 26 samples studied, 20 NFLGs and 4 partial fragments were de novo assembled into contiguous sequences and successfully subtyped. Two distinct BF1 recombinant profiles designated CRF70_BF1 and CRF71_BF1, with 4 samples in profile I and 11 in profile II were detected and thus constitute two novel recombinant forms circulating in PE. Evidence of dual infections was detected in four patients co-infected with distinct HIV-1 subtypes. According to our estimate, the new CRF71_BF1 accounts for 10% of the HIV-1 circulating strains among blood donors in PE. Discordant data between the plasma and PBMCs-virus were found in 15 of 24 donors. Six of these strains displayed major DRMs only in PBMCs and four of which had detectable DRMs changes at prevalence between 1-20% of the sequenced population.

4422,A genetic analysis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in rare blood donors who remained HCV seronegative despite long-term high-level viremia revealed the chronic presence of HCV genomes with large in frame deletions in their structural genes. Full-length HCV genomes were only detected as minority variants. In one immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected donor the truncated HCV genome transiently decreased in frequency concomitant with delayed seroconversion and re-emerged following partial seroreversion. The long-term production of heavily truncated HCV genomes in vivo suggests that these viruses retained the necessary elements for RNA replication while the deleted structural functions necessary for their spread in vivo was provided in trans by wild-type helper virus in co-infected cells.

4430,"Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is prevalent and often causes hepatic fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and cause liver cancer or liver failure. Study of fibrosis progression often relies on imputing the time of infection, often as the reported age of first injection drug use. We sought to examine the accuracy of such imputation and implications for modeling factors that influence progression rates. We analyzed cross-sectional data on hepatitis C antibody status and reported risk factor histories from two large studies, the Women's Interagency HIV Study and the Urban Health Study, using modern survival analysis methods for current status data to model past infection risk year by year. We compared fitted distributions of past infection risk to reported age of first injection drug use. Although injection drug use appeared to be a very strong risk factor, models for both studies showed that many subjects had considerable probability of having been infected substantially before or after their reported age of first injection drug use. Persons reporting younger age of first injection drug use were more likely to have been infected after, and persons reporting older age of first injection drug use were more likely to have been infected before. In cross-sectional studies of fibrosis progression where date of HCV infection is estimated from risk factor histories, modern methods such as multiple imputation should be used to account for the substantial uncertainty about when infection occurred.

4432,"The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is a powerful new tool for amplifying target DNA, thus allowing for sensitive detection of specific nucleic acid sequences. One important potential use of PCR involves screening the donated blood supply for transfusion-transmitted viruses. Realization of this goal has been limited by (1) the requirement for multiple, discrete PCR reactions to amplify and detect target sequences of more than one virus, and (2) the lack of a rapid, nonhazardous means for specific detection of one or more PCR-amplified products. We report the simultaneous amplification of three distinct target sequences without discernable loss in sensitivity toward any single target sequence.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the only known cure for a variety of inherited diseases and requires the administration of high doses of immunosuppressive and myeloablative therapy. Because the fetus is immunoincompetent early in gestation, in utero stem cell transplantation (IUT) could avoid the need for this toxic conditioning.

4478,"Background Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, the causative agent of Chagas disease, infects about six million individuals in more than 20 countries. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is of utmost importance to develop and evaluate treatments to control the disease. Routine screening for infected human individuals is achieved by serological assays; PCR testing to monitor spontaneous or therapy-induced parasitological cure has limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate a newly developed antibody profiling assay as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on waning of antibody following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection.   Methodology/Principal findings We designed a multiplex serology assay, an array of fifteen optimized T. cruzi antigens, to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One specific antibody response (antibody 3, Ab3) showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signal was strongly associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, whereas significant and progressive decline in Ab3 signals was observed in BZN-treated patients who cleared parasitemia based on blood PCR results.   Conclusion/Significance Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients.

We conducted a survey of clinical practice of prognostication after therapeutic hypothermia (TH) became common practice in Norway. By telephone, we interviewed the consultants who were in charge of the 25 ICUs admitting cardiac patients using 6 structured questions regarding timing, tests used and medical specialties involved in prognostication, as well as the clinical importance of the different parameters used and the application of TH in these patients. Prognostication was conducted within 24–48 hours in the majority (72%) of the participating ICUs. The most commonly applied parameters and tests were a clinical neurological examination (100%), prehospital data (76%), CCT (56%) and EEG (52%). The parameters and tests considered to be of greatest importance for accurate prognostication were prehospital data (56%), neurological examination (52%), and EEG (20%). In 76% of the ICUs, a multidisciplinary approach to prognostication was applied, but only one ICU used a standardised protocol. Therapeutic hypothermia was in routine use in 80% of the surveyed ICUs. Despite the routine use of TH, outcome prediction was performed early and was mainly based on prehospital information, neurological examination and CCT and EEG evaluation.

4523,"Many human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals suffer from persistent immune activation. Chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation have been associated with an increased risk of age-related diseases even among patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy. The factors leading to immune activation are complex, but have been hypothesized to include persistent viral replication with cellular death as well as microbial translocation across the gastrointestinal tract. Both processes may trigger innate immune responses since many native molecules released from dying cells are similar in structure to pathogen associated molecular patterns. These damage associated molecular patterns include mitochondrial DNA and formylated peptides. We hypothesized that circulating mitochondrial nucleic acid could serve as a biomarker for HIV-associated cell death and drive innate immune activation in infected individuals. We developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for plasma mitochondrial DNA and validated it on normal blood donors. We then measured mitochondrial DNA levels in acute and chronic HIV infection. While the assay proved to be accurate with a robust dynamic range, we did not find a significant association between HIV disease status and circulating mitochondrial DNA.

Because NF-kappa B is also expressed in resting B cells we suggested that B cells might provide an optimal intracellular environment for HIV-1 transcription. Using a transient transfection assay, we show that the HIV-1 LTR is indeed more efficiently transcribed in the B cell line Raji than in the T cell line Jurkat, and that this effect maps to the transcriptional enhancer (NF-kappa B binding site) of the LTR. Furthermore, we show that Raji cells which have been rendered CD4-positive by gene transfection are susceptible to HIV-1 infection, and that viral gene expression and replication are more efficient in these CD4-positive B cells than in CD4-positive T cells.

4550,"Since the first antibody tests for the diagnosis of hu-man immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1985, many “new and improved” HIV screening and diagnostic tests have been developed, and a variety of testing algorithms have come into use. HIV antibody tests have evolved from first generation HIV-1 (clade B) viral lysate-based, indirect antibody enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to third generation antigen-sandwich immunoassays that use synthetic peptide and recombinant DNA-derived antigens that represent the immunodominant epitopes from diverse HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains. These third generation enzyme immunoassays have substantially enhanced sensitivity to divergent viral variants and have shortened the infection-to-seroconversion window period by more than 3 weeks compared with first generation tests. Assays have also been developed that detect and quantitate viral antigen (p24) and nucleic acids (HIV RNA or DNA) in blood, and in body fluids and tissues.

4565,"BACKGROUNDDecisions regarding addition (or discontinuation) of donor screening tests must be based on accurate estimates for the residual risk of transmission of each agent by transfusions and the capacity of tests under consideration to reduce (or increase) these risks. The risks of acquiring a major viral infection (eg, HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)) from contemporary screened transfusions are now so low that classic approaches for estimating the residual risks are no longer feasible. These approaches include (1) investigation of clinically identified posttransfusion cases,(2) prospective follow-up of recipients to document Seroconversion, and (3) special laboratory studies of seronegative donor specimens to detect missed infections. My colleagues and I have developed a new approach for estimating the residual risk of virus transmission associated with infectious, seroconverting, window-period donations. The approach is based on combining estimates of the incidence rate of infection among repeat donors with estimates for the duration of the preseroconversion window period for each agent, thus deriving the rate of missed, window-phase donations. Similarly, data on the capacity of a new test to reduce the infectious window period can be combined with the incidence rate for that agent to estimate the net yield and incremental reduction in risk that would be achieved by routine implementation of the test.",MP Bush,13,12445281025731074206,"Program and Abstracts of the National Institutes of Health Development Conference.

4575,"Policies for the storage of specimens from blood donations differ between countries. Generally, the purpose of archiving aliquots of donations, usually as plasma or serum stored at–30 C, is the resolving of complications of transfusions [transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), post-transfusion infections, etc.] and/or for legal inquiries. Some of the archives are also or exclusively used for scientific purposes. Other archives link donation samples with recipient samples to enable the study of the transmission of blood-borne infectious diseases.

This resulted in more than 200 publications over the last decades, mainly focussing on blood safety issues. To obtain more information about the practice also in other countries in the world of storing blood specimens from donations and recipients of these donations, the following questions were sent to experts in the field.

4576,"One of the most promising areas of transplantation research is the recent discovery of biomarkers for rejection that are detectable in blood and urine. Biopsy-confirmed rejection, the current gold standard for diagnosis of allograft rejection, is invasive and subject to sampling errors. For example, diagnosis of episodes of rejection of pancreas allografts, which are frequent and can destroy the allograft, depends on conventional percutaneous biopsies that have a diagnostic sensitivity of only 79%–88%(1, 2) and are associated with a 2%–7% risk of serious complications (3).

4579,"Rates of HIV-1 progression vary widely. To investigate the relative effects of viral and host characteristics on course, we compared persons infected by the same and different subtype B strains. Forty-three infection chain clusters were identified, each defined by an infected blood donor, that donor's recipients, and the recipients' sexual partners, representing second and third generations of infection. Analysis of levels and rates of change in CD4 lymphocyte counts and viral load showed that members within a cluster were no more alike in their rates of change in CD4+ lymphocyte counts or viral RNA levels than among clusters. Differences in entry viral RNA levels by cluster were marginal and markedly smaller than interindividual differences.

4583,"Quantitative viral outgrowth assays (QVOA) use limiting dilutions of CD4+ T cells to measure the size of the latent HIV-1 reservoir, a major obstacle to curing HIV-1. Efforts to reduce the reservoir require assays that can reliably quantify its size in blood and tissues. Although QVOA is regarded as a “gold standard” for reservoir measurement, little is known about its accuracy and precision or about how cell storage conditions or laboratory-specific practices affect results. Owing to this lack of knowledge, confidence intervals around reservoir size estimates—as well as judgments of the ability of therapeutic interventions to alter the size of the replication-competent but transcriptionally inactive latent reservoir—rely on theoretical statistical assumptions about dilution assays. To address this gap, we have carried out a Bayesian statistical analysis of QVOA reliability on 75 split samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 5 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-suppressed participants, measured using four different QVOAs at separate labs, estimating assay precision and the effect of frozen cell storage on estimated reservoir size. We found that typical assay results are expected to differ from the true value by a factor of 1.6 to 1.9 up or down. Systematic assay differences comprised a 24-fold range between the assays with highest and lowest scales, likely reflecting differences in viral outgrowth readout and input cell stimulation protocols. We also found that controlled-rate freezing and storage of samples did not cause substantial differences in QVOA compared to use of fresh cells (95% probability of < 2-fold change), supporting continued use of frozen …",Daniel IS Rosenbloom and Peter Bacchetti and Mars Stone and Xutao Deng and Ronald J Bosch and Douglas D Richman and Janet D Siliciano and John W Mellors and Steven G Deeks and Roger G Ptak and Rebecca Hoh and Sheila M Keating and Melanie Dimapasoc and Marta Massanella and Jun Lai and Michele D Sobolewski and Deanna A Kulpa and Michael P Busch and Reservoir Assay Validation and Evaluation Network (RAVEN) Study Group,11,18248683584302292168,PLoS computational biology,4,e1006849,Public Library of Science,Assessing intra-lab precision and inter-lab repeatability of outgrowth assays of HIV-1 latent reservoir size,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006849,15,2019,/scholar?cites=18248683584302292168,11F_c5oAAAAJ:gPamCmV4epEC

This study examined whether holidays, geographical area and donation type (community versus replacement) has any impact on the fluctuation of donations.    METHODS: The numbers of blood donations from 2007 through 2010 in three Brazilian Retrovirus Epidemiological Donor Study II (REDS-II) participating centers were analyzed according to the week of donation. The weeks were classified as holiday or non-holiday. To compare donations performed during holiday versus non-holiday weeks, tabulations and descriptive statistics for weekly donations by blood center were examined and time series analysis was conducted.    RESULTS: The average weekly number of donations varied according to the blood center and type of week. The average number of donations decreased significantly during Carnival and Christmas and increased during the Brazilian National Donor Week. The fluctuation was more pronounced in Recife and Belo Horizonte when compared to São Paulo and higher among community donors.

4620,"Blood donors are considered one of the healthiest populations. This study describes the epidemiology of cancer in a cohort of blood donors up to 20 years after blood donation. Records from donors who participated in the Retroviral Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS, 1991–2002) at Blood Centers of the Pacific (BCP), San Francisco, were linked to the California Cancer Registry (CCR, 1991–2010). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were estimated using standard US 2000 population, and survival analysis used to compare all-cause mortality among donors and a random sample of nondonors with cancer from CCR.  Of 55,158 eligible allogeneic blood donors followed-up for 863,902 person-years, 4,236 (7.7%) primary malignant cancers were diagnosed. SIR in donors was 1.59 (95% CI = 1.54,1.64). Donors had significantly lower mortality (adjusted HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.66–0.74) compared with nondonor cancer patients, except for respiratory system cancers (adjusted HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.82–1.05). Elevated cancer incidence among blood donors may reflect higher diagnosis rates due to health seeking behavior and cancer screening in donors.

4623,"Introduction Biomarker-based cross-sectional incidence estimation requires a Recent Infection Testing Algorithm (RITA) with an adequately large mean recency duration, to achieve reasonable survey counts, and a low false-recent rate, to minimise exposure to further bias and imprecision. Estimating these characteristics requires specimens from individuals with well-known seroconversion dates or confirmed long-standing infection. Specimens with well-known seroconversion dates are typically rare and precious, presenting a bottleneck in the development of RITAs.   Methods The mean recency duration and a ‘false-recent rate’ are estimated from data on seroconverting blood donors. Within an idealised model for the dynamics of false-recent results, blood donor specimens were used to characterise RITAs by a new method that maximises the likelihood of cohort-level recency classifications, rather than modelling individual sojourn times in recency.   Results For a range of assumptions about the false-recent results (0% to 20% of biomarker response curves failing to reach the threshold distinguishing test-recent and test-non-recent infection), the mean recency duration of the Vironostika-LS ranged from 154 (95% CI: 96–231) to 274 (95% CI: 234–313) days in the South African donor population (n = 282), and from 145 (95% CI: 67–226) to 252 (95% CI: 194–308) days in the American donor population (n = 106).

4641,"A number of HIV-1 subtypes are identified in Pakistan by characterization of partial viral gene sequences. Little is known whether new recombinants are generated and how they disseminate since whole genome sequences for these viruses have not been characterized. Near full-length genome (NFLG) sequences were obtained by amplifying two overlapping half genomes or next generation sequencing from 34 HIV-1-infected individuals in Pakistan. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that the newly characterized sequences were 16 subtype As, one subtype C, and 17 A/G recombinants. Further analysis showed that all 16 subtype A1 sequences (47%), together with the vast majority of sequences from Pakistan from other studies, formed a tight subcluster (A1a) within the subtype A1 clade, suggesting that they were derived from a single introduction. More in-depth analysis of 17 A/G NFLG sequences showed that five shared similar recombination breakpoints as in CRF02 (15%) but were phylogenetically distinct from the prototype CRF02 by forming a tight subcluster (CRF02a) while 12 (38%) were new recombinants between CRF02a and A1a or a divergent A1b viruses.

A systematic comparison of results from multiple sites is needed to determine whether a standardized protocol is required for consistent and accurate data analysis. A panel of well-characterized HIV-1 isolates (N = 50) from the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) was assembled for evaluation at seven international sites. This virus panel included seven subtypes, six circulating recombinant forms (CRFs), nine unique recombinant forms (URFs) and three group O viruses. Seven viruses contained 10 major drug resistance mutations (DRMs). HIV-1 isolates were prepared at a concentration of 107 copies/ml and compiled into blinded panels. Subtypes and DRMs were determined with partial or full pol gene sequences by conventional Sanger sequencing and/or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Subtype and DRM results were reported and decoded for comparison with full-length genome sequences generated by EQAPOL. The partial pol gene was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced for 89.4%-100% of group M viruses at six sites. Subtyping results of majority of the viruses (83%-97.9%) were correctly determined for the partial pol sequences. All 10 major DRMs in seven isolates were detected at these six sites.

4652,"BACKGROUND: Calculations of the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in the blood donor setting that are based solely on data for seroconversion to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) will underestimate the incidence due to the transient nature of antigenemia. Estimates based on antibody to hepatitis B core antigen will overestimate the incidence due to false-positive results caused by the nonspecificity of the test.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serologic test results were obtained from multiple-time volunteer donors at five United States blood centers from January 1991 through December 1993. The observed HBsAg seroconversion rate was multiplied by an adjustment factor, derived from the weighted average probability of a positive HBsAg test for HBV-infected donors who become chronic carriers, for donors with a primary antibody response without detectable antigenemia, and for donors who develop transient antigenemia. RESULTS: Among 586,507 multiple-time donors giving 2,318,356 donations and observed for 822,426 personyears, the HBsAg incidence rate was 4.01 per 100,000 person-years. On the basis of prior reports of the duration of HBsAg positivity and the observed distribution of interdonation intervals among the study group, there was an estimated 53-percent chance that an HBV-infected dcnor with transient antigenemia would have a positive HBsAg test result. If 70 percent of newly HBV-infected adults have transient antigenemia, 25 percent have a primary antibody response without primary antigenemia, and 5 percent become chronic carriers, the overall chance of being detected by the HBsAg test was 42 …",JJ Korelitz and MP Busch and SH Kleinman and AE Williams and RO Gilcher and HE Ownby and GB Schreiber,8,628752348640314468,Transfusion,,634-640,,TRANSFUSION COMPLICATIONS,https://www.academia.edu/download/46065769/A_method_for_estimating_hepatitis_B_viru20160530-21288-1bfn2x3.pdf,37,1997,/scholar?cites=628752348640314468,11F_c5oAAAAJ:rDsFeusoTZkC

4677,"Background  As in many other settings, peak excess mortality preceded the officially reported 9first wave9 peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Manaus, Brazil, reflecting delayed case recognition and limited initial access to diagnostic testing.   Methods and Findings  To avoid early information bias, we used detailed age and gender stratified death certificate and hospitalisation data to evaluate the epidemic9s trajectory and infer the cause of its decline using a stochastic model. Our results are consistent with heterogenous transmission reducing from mid-April 2020 due to the development of herd immunity. Relative to a baseline model that assumed homogenous mixing across Manaus, a model that permitted a self-isolated population fraction reduced the population-wide attack rate required to drop the effective reproduction number below one from 62% to 47%, and reduced the final attack rate from 86% to 65%. In the latter scenario, a substantial proportion of vulnerable, older individuals remained susceptible to infection.  Conclusions  Our models indicate that the development of herd immunity amongst the mixing proportion of the Manaus population had effectively halted the COVID-19 epidemic by late July 2020. Given uncertainties regarding the distancing behaviours of population subgroups with different social and economic characteristics, and the duration of sterilising or transmission-modifying immunity in exposed individuals, we conclude that the potential for epidemic outbreaks remains, but that future waves of infection are likely to be much less pronounced than that already experienced.",Thomas Prowse and Tara Purcell and Djane Clarys Baia-da-Silva and Vanderson Sampaio and Wuelton Marcelo Monteiro and James Wood and Ivo Mueller and Jodie McVernon and Marcus Lacerda and Joshua Ross,6,14073102317525114924,medRxiv,,,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,"Inferred resolution through herd immmunity of first COVID-19 wave in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.25.20201939v3.abstract,,2020,/scholar?cites=14073102317525114924,11F_c5oAAAAJ:gubd_9ZgCi8C
4678,"Studies have demonstrated that intensive ART alone is not capable of eradicating HIV-1, as the virus rebounds within a few weeks upon treatment interruption. Viral rebound may be induced from several cellular subsets; however, the majority of proviral DNA has been found in antigen experienced resting CD4+ T cells. To achieve a cure for HIV-1, eradication strategies depend upon both understanding mechanisms that drive HIV-1 persistence as well as sensitive assays to measure the frequency of infected cells after therapeutic interventions. Assays such as the quantitative viral outgrowth assay (QVOA) measure HIV-1 persistence during ART by ex vivo activation of resting CD4+ T cells to induce latency reversal; however, recent studies have shown that only a fraction of replication-competent viruses are inducible by primary mitogen stimulation. Previous studies have shown a correlation between the acquisition of effector memory phenotype and HIV-1 latency reversal in quiescent CD4+ T cell subsets that harbor the reservoir. Here, we apply our mechanistic understanding that differentiation into effector memory CD4+ T cells more effectively promotes HIV-1 latency reversal to significantly improve proviral measurements in the QVOA, termed differentiation QVOA (dQVOA), which reveals a significantly higher frequency of the inducible HIV-1 replication-competent reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells.",Elizabeth R Wonderlich and Krupa Subramanian and Bryan Cox and Ann Wiegand and Carol Lackman-Smith and Michael J Bale and Mars Stone and Rebecca Hoh and Mary F Kearney and Frank Maldarelli and Steven G Deeks and Michael P Busch and Roger G Ptak and Deanna A Kulpa,6,3545703698459919049,PLoS pathogens,10,e1008074,Public Library of Science,Effector memory differentiation increases detection of replication-competent HIV-l in resting CD4+ T cells from virally suppressed individuals,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008074&rev=2,15,2019,/scholar?cites=3545703698459919049,11F_c5oAAAAJ:N2osnxbUuuUC

4725,"Background Two manufacturers, Maxim Biomedical and Sedia Biosciences Corporation, supply CDC-approved versions of the HIV-1 Limiting Antigen Avidity EIA (LAg) for detecting ‘recent’ HIV infection in cross-sectional incidence estimation. This study assesses and compares the performance of the two assays for incidence surveillance.   Methods We ran both assays on a panel of 2,500 well-characterized HIV-1-infected specimens. We analysed concordance of assay results, assessed reproducibility using repeat testing and estimated mean durations of recent infection (MDRIs) and false-recent rates (FRRs) for a range of normalized optical density (ODn) thresholds, alone and in combination with viral load thresholds. We defined three hypothetical surveillance scenarios, similar to the Kenyan and South African epidemics, and a concentrated epidemic. These scenarios allowed us to evaluate the precision of incidence estimates obtained by means of various recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs) based on each of the two assays.   Results The Maxim assay produced lower ODn values than the Sedia assay on average, largely as a result of higher calibrator readings (mean OD of 0.749 vs. 0.643), with correlation of normalized readings lower (R2 = 0.908 vs. R2 = 0.938). Reproducibility on blinded control specimens was slightly better for Maxim. The MDRI of a Maxim-based algorithm at the ‘standard’ threshold (ODn ≤1.5 & VL >1,000) was 201 days (95% CI: 180,223) and for Sedia 171 (152,191).

4738,"Retroviruses have a wide distribution in nature, with examples in insects, reptiles and nearly all mammals. The human retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 1 and 2), belongs to the lentivirus group of the retrovirus family, whilst human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV I and II) belongs to the oncorna group. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus I and II are thought to have evolved from simian T-lymphotropic retroviruses that were transmitted to humans over the past centuries or millenia. Human immunodeficiency virus is thought to have derived from simian immunodeficiency viruses that are endemic in chimpanzees in Central Africa, and probably infected natives over the past century (Sharp et al., 2001).Retroviruses are membrane-coated, single stranded RNA viruses that have a distinct genomic organization and require the presence of reverse transcriptase in their replication cycle. In a typical infection, retrovirus particles attach to the cell membrane, reverse transcriptase copies viral RNA into complementary double stranded DNA and this is integrated into the host cell chromosome. Host cell enzymes help virus and host regulatory genes complete the retrovirus lifecycle by producing virions that bud from the plasma membrane to infect other cells or organisms.",Brian C Dow and Eberhard W Fiebig and Michael P Busch,4,7694389565474981308,This page intentionally left blank,,59,,4 RETROVIRUSES,https://www.academia.edu/download/48483189/Transfusion_Microbiology.pdf#page=81,,2008,/scholar?cites=7694389565474981308,11F_c5oAAAAJ:ybfzIt2tCtgC

Plasma CMV PCR assays were performed before transfusion and weekly after transfusion for 4 weeks. NWBCR cases with evidence of possible reactivation and/or superinfection were further studied for donor viremia by DNA PCR of frozen retention segments and new genotype acquisition using gB envelope sequence analysis of pre‐ and posttransfusion recipient specimens.RESULTS:  VATS patients …",W Lawrence Drew and Sunwen Chou and Beth A Mohr and Susan F Assmann and Richard C Miner and Megan E Laycock and Michael P Busch and Viral Activation Transfusion Study Group,4,8974912258678294091,Transfusion,10,1351-1357,Blackwell Science Inc,"Absence of activation of CMV by blood transfusion to HIV‐infected, CMV‐seropositive patients",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00520.x,43,2003,/scholar?cites=8974912258678294091,11F_c5oAAAAJ:QVtou7C4vgoC

4769,"Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus (family Togaviridae), transmitted mainly by Haemagogus species in the American continent. The first MAYV strains were isolated from the blood of infected, symptomatic humans in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954 (Anderson et al., 1957). Since then, MAYV was repeatedly detected in humans and mosquito vectors in Central and Southern America (Mackay and Arden, 2016; Acosta-Ampudia et al., 2018). Two unique reports from Haiti raises the issue of circulation in the Caribbean and requires further confirmatory investigations (Lednicky et al., 2016; White et al., 2014). MAYV is transmitted by Haemagogus species in an enzootic cycle using non-human primates (NHPs) as the main amplification and maintenance hosts, and humans becoming sporadically infected when venturing in or nearby forest habitats. Currently, three MAYV genotypes have been described (namely: D, L and N). MAYV shares with other arboviruses, in particular the related chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a clinical presentation typically characterized by fever, headache and rash during the acute case, together with a polyarthralgia that can persist for months or even years (Mackay and Arden, 2016; Hassing et al., 2010; Halsey et al., 2013; Thiberville et al., 2013; Heath et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2005). This makes accurate diagnosis based on clinical presentation difficult and it is expected that cases of MAYV infection are being misdiagnosed and/or underreported because of the massive circulation of CHIKV (or even dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) and oropouche virus (OROV)) in the Americas in recent decades.

Near-full-length genome (NFLG) sequences were obtained by amplifying two overlapping half genomes from plasma samples collected between 2015 and 2017 from 23 newly diagnosed infected individuals in the Philippines. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the newly characterized sequences were CRF01_AE (14), subtype B (3), CRF01/B recombinants (5) and a CRF01/CRF07/B recombinant (1). All 14 CRF01_AE formed a tight cluster, suggesting that they were derived from a single introduction.

Digital PCR works by partitioning a sample of DNA or cDNA into many individual, parallel PCR reactions. Current quantification methods rely on the assumption that the PCR reactions are always able to detect single target molecules. When the assumption does not hold, the copy numbers will be severely underestimated. We developed a novel dPCR quantification method which determines whether the single copy assumption is violated or not by simultaneously estimating the assay sensitivity and the copy numbers using serial dilution data sets.

4781,"Background The first stages of HIV-1 infection are essential to establish the diversity of virus population within host. It has been suggested that adaptation to host cells and antibody evasion are the leading forces driving HIV evolution at the initial stages of AIDS infection. In order to gain more insights on adaptive HIV-1 evolution, the genetic diversity was evaluated during the infection time in individuals contaminated by the same viral source in an epidemic cluster. Multiple sequences of V3 loop region of the HIV-1 were serially sampled from four individuals: comprising a single blood donor, two blood recipients, and another sexually infected by one of the blood recipients. The diversity of the viral population within each host was analyzed independently in distinct time points during HIV-1 infection.   Results Phylogenetic analysis identified multiple HIV-1 variants transmitted through blood transfusion but the establishing of new infections was initiated by a limited number of viruses. Positive selection (dN/dS>1) was detected in the viruses within each host in all time points. In the intra-host viruses of the blood donor and of one blood recipient, X4 variants appeared respectively in 1993 and 1989. In both patients X4 variants never reached high frequencies during infection time. The recipient, who X4 variants appeared, developed AIDS but kept narrow and constant immune response against HIV-1 during the infection time.   Conclusion Slowing rates of adaptive evolution and increasing diversity in HIV-1 are consequences of the CD4+ T cells depletion.

4789,"Owing to the long incubation period from infection to aids, researchers often ignore the fact that infection with hiv, the onset of infectivity, and a detectable antibody response on standard screening assays are not simultaneous. The time at which hiv antibody is ﬁrst detectable in peripheral blood using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (eia) can vary by manufacturer and generation of test (ﬁrst-generation tests were replaced by second-generation tests in 1987, and thirdgeneration tests or combination hiv-1/hiv-2 tests became available in 1992). Typically the differences in onset of detectability are fairly small. For example, dna pcr can detect hiv infection on average about 5 days before p24 antigen can be detected, which in turn occurs on average about 5 days before a third-generation hiv 1/2 combination test can detect hivantibodies. 1 However, for some events in early hiv infection the appropriate timescale may be weeks rather than days. For example, Satten and Sternberg estimate that on average about 44 days pass between seroconversion on an hiv 1/2 combi test and development of a 3-band positive Western blot assay result, 1 and Busch, Lee, and Satten et al. estimate that approximately 20 days sep-",Glen A Satten and RA Janssen and Susan Stramer and Michael P Busch,3,16407866617303263630,,,,"Yale University Press, New Haven",Development and validation of a serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=16407866617303263630&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,2001,/scholar?cites=16407866617303263630,11F_c5oAAAAJ:YB4bud6kWLwC

Mechanisms of potential resistance to HIV in SCD are incompletely understood. We retrospectively reviewed the Transfusion Safety Study to compare HIV status between people with SCD and other congenital anemias who were routinely exposed to blood products during the high-risk period before HIV screening implementation. Non-SCD congenital anemia diagnosis was associated with a higher risk of HIV acquisition compared to SCD (OR 13.1 95%CI 1.6–108.9). In addition, we prospectively enrolled 30 SCD cases and 30 non-SCD controls to investigate potential mechanisms of resistance to HIV in SCD. CCR5 and CCR7 expression was lower and CD4 expression was higher on CD4+ T cells from SCD cases compared to controls. Surface expression of CD4+ T cell CXCR4, CD38 and HLA-DR did not differ between the groups. SCD CD4+ T cells were not less susceptible to HIV infection than controls. Levels of multiple cytokines were elevated in the SCD plasma, but SCD plasma compared to control plasma did not inhibit HIV infection of target cells. In conclusion, our epidemiological data support people with SCD being resistant to HIV infection. Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7, balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels, which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection.

High capacity serologic assays detecting binding antibodies (bAb) have been developed, nAb assays are not adaptable to high-throughput testing. We sought to determine the effectiveness of using surrogate bAb signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/CO) in predicting nAb titers using a pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization (RVPN) assay.   METHODS: CCP donor serum collected by 3 US blood collectors was tested with a bAb assay (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total, CoV2T) and a nAb RVPN assay. CoV2T prediction effectiveness at S/CO thresholds was evaluated for RVPN nAb NT50 titers using receiver operating characteristic analysis.  RESULTS: 753 CCPs were tested with median CoV2T S/CO of 71.2 and median NT50 of 527.5.  Proportions of CCP donors with NT50 over various target nAb titers were 86% ≥1:80, 76% ≥1:160, and 62%≥1:320.  Increasing CoV2Ts reduced the sensitivity to predict NT50 titers, while specificity to identify those below thresholds increased.  As the targeted NT50 increased, the positive predictive value fell with reciprocal increase in negative predictive value. S/CO thresholds were thus less able to predict target NT50 titers.  CONCLUSION: Selection of a clinically effective nAb titer will impact availability of CCP.  Product release with CoV2T assay S/CO thresholds must balance the risk of releasing products below target nAb titers with the cost of false negatives.

4808,"Elite controllers (EC), a small subset of the HIV-positive population (< 1%), suppress HIV viremia below the limit of quantification of clinical viral load assays in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, there is a paucity of longitudinal data detailing the viral and immune dynamics or HIV reservoir seeding during acute infection in individuals that go on to become Elite Controllers. In this report, we describe a case of a 42 year old woman diagnosed during acute infection who rapidly and permanently suppressed her viremia in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Rapid antibody/antigen testing was either negative or equivocal during acute infection, despite subsequent viral load testing at that time point with 71,550 plasma HIV RNA copies/mL, making initial diagnosis challenging. The patient subsequently developed detectable anti-HIV antibodies and an increase in HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses to overlapping subtype C HIV gag peptide; very low-level plasma viremia (0.84 RNA copies/mL) was detected by an ultrasensitive assay 2 years following infection. Subsequently, she was started on ART for multifocal furunculosis despite continued suppression of virus and stable CD4+ T cell counts. Following ART initiation, HIV specific antibody levels and CD8+ T cell responses increased, but no HIV DNA or RNA was able to be isolated from large numbers of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells.

4828,"Since its emergence in 1999 in America, West Nile virus (WNV) has become the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in the United States. The infection is often asymptomatic but, when clinical manifestations occur, a broad range of symptoms is observed from flu-like symptoms to more serious neurological disorders that can sometimes lead to death. No treatment or vaccine is available for humans. Ongoing studies are trying to understand the host-virus dynamics that lead to the development of severe neurological symptoms in a minority of infected subjects. The amount of knowledge that was gained from parallel studies in animals and humans, comparing asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, and using what was known of other Flaviviruses, will eventually translate to the development of potential therapeutic and prophylactic solutions. This review presents a synthesis of the most relevant findings concerning the immune response to WNV and its impact on disease outcome and gives an overview of the most promising therapeutic and prophylactic solutions.",Marion C Lanteri and Michael S Diamond and Philip J Norris and Michael P Busch,2,2936281967880708762,,4,382-386,,West Nile virus.

Replication of HBV via an error-prone viral reverse transcriptase coupled with a high rate of virus production allows the virus to generate a large pool of mutations throughout the genome. In addition, the compact organization of the viral genome, with its overlapping reading frames, allows almost every mutation to have potentially pleiotropic effects. Mutations in the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) gene can result in amino acid changes in the HBsAg immunodominant"" a"" determinant that affect the binding of antibodies used in HBsAg immunoassays.

This raised the question of the relevance of NAT testing of blood donations, in reinforcing the safety of the blood supply, by detecting acute viral infections in the ‘window phase'that were not detected by current licensed serological screening methods. The first Blood Centre to introduce NAT testing as a measure of quality control for solvent/detergent (SD)-inactivated plasma was Northrhein–Westphalia (Germany), in 1995. Initially, three viral genomes [hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)] were tested by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a private laboratory and thereafter by using an in-house PCR at the Blood Center in Frankfurt.

4882,"Increase of peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts is a key goal of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); most, but not all, recipients respond adequately and promptly. A small number of studies have examined specific genetic factors associated with the extent of CD4 recovery. We report a genome-wide examination of factors that predict CD4 recovery in HIV-infected women. We identified women in in a cohort study who were on cART with viral load below 400 copies, and drew racially and ethnically matched samples of those with good CD4 response over 2 years or poor response. We analyzed the exomes of those women employing next generation sequencing for genes associated with CD4 recovery after controlling for non-genetic factors identified through forward stepwise selection as important. We studied 48 women with good CD4 recovery and 42 with poor CD4 recovery during virologically-suppressive cART.

Although latent infection of long-lived CD4+ T cells contributes to viral persistence, the finding of low-level replication in elite controllers suggests a more active sanctuary where productively infected cells are shielded from immune destruction.Methods: We used flow cytometric cell sorting to isolate cell populations from lymph nodes (LN) obtained from rhesus macaques (RM) with chronic SIVmac239/251 infection and varying SIV replication set-points, ranging from progressive infection to elite control. In selected RM, LN biopsies were obtained before and after in vivo CD8+ cell depletion with monoclonal antibody M-T807R1.

4904,"BACKGROUND: As part of its risk management process, Canadian Blood Services (CBS) constructed mathematical models of how newly emerging pathogens might affect blood transfusion recipients.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: CBS convened an expert panel including medical, health economics, analytical, risk management, and insurance professionals to examine multiple data sources. The model for emerging pathogen risk included separate modules to calculate the frequency and severity of infections from transfusion-transmitted agents that could cause either acute transient or chronic persistent infection. Important model input variables were annual number of components transfused, the presumed incidence and prevalence of a new agent, the time interval of recipient risk, recipient age and sex, projected recipient survival, rate of secondary infection, pathogen-induced morbidity, and the associated medical costs of such morbidity. RESULTS: In the 5-year time frame considered in the model, it was estimated that approximately 3500 recipient infections (two-SD range of 0 to 11,370 infections) could occur from an emerging pathogen that establishes a chronic infection in donors, with 60% of these due to red blood cell transfusion. The medical costs associated with recipient outcomes due to a catastrophic emerging pathogen could be lowered by 20% if an effective pathogen reduction method for either platelets or plasma were in place. CONCLUSION: This modeling exercise offers a framework for other blood services to construct similar models. It also provides a useful way to model the implementation of new blood safety interventions …",Steven Kleinman and Claire Cameron and Brian Custer and Michael Busch and Louis Katz and Boris Kralj and Ian Matheson and Ken Murphy and Jutta Preiksaitis and Dana Devine,1,172943207189040199,Transfusion,,2592-2606,,Transfusion complications,http://www.academia.edu/download/46065835/Modeling_the_risk_of_an_emerging_pathoge20160530-12577-1fu4fa9.pdf,50,2010,/scholar?cites=172943207189040199,11F_c5oAAAAJ:G7txJ4jiatkC

4917,"Problem statement: We studied in detail a case in which a nurse caring for an HIV-infected child suffered a deep-laceration accident with contaminated blood. Approach: The patient had been treated with zidovudine (ZDV) and the nurse became infected despite prophylactic use of ZDV initiated 2 h after the accident. A reactive anti-HIV-1/2 EIA and an indeterminate western blot (gp120/160 reactivity) were obtained from the nurse on the day of the accident, suggesting preexposure infection. However, a negative western blot and positive DNA PCR were documented 10 days after the accident and seroconversion occurred an additional two weeks later. Results: Phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 tat and C2-C4-gp120 env regions confirmed that the nurse infected by two different HIV-1 strains present in the child. Strains present in both subjects revealed multinucleoside resistant HIV-1. Dilutional serological studies using 10 HIV-infected patients’ sera demonstrated that passive seroreactivity could occur with infusion of less than 1 uL of blood when highly sensitive assays are employed. Conclusion: This is the first well-documented case of passive HIV antibody detection after a percutaneous exposure. Reactive baseline serology should not be assumed to represent prior infection nor exclude prophylaxis.

4921,"BACKGROUND: Surveys have shown donor dissatisfaction with the duration of the donation process and repetitive questioning. An abbreviated donor history questionnaire (AQ) may improve satisfaction, but must be safe.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An FDA-approved34-question AQ was implemented in 2003. Travel, medication, and health history questions were decreased by 18. Donors were eligible for AQ if they had successfully completed three donor suitability assessments on the fulllength questionnaire (FQ), including one in the prior 6 months. Data were analyzed from more than 50,000 donations during each of three 20-day periods over the first year of progressive implementation of the AQ. We evaluated the performance of the AQ by comparing donor deferrals for medical history (MHD), physical examination findings (PED), and reactive screening and/or confirmatory tests (RSCT) for viral markers among AQ-ineligible and AQ-eligible donors and separately among AQ-eligible donors who received AQ or FQ. RESULTS: Approximately one-third of presenting donors were AQ-eligible. Use of AQ progressed from 48 percent in October 2003 to 76 percent in November 2004. AQ-eligible donors had lower rates of MHD, PED, and RSCT than donors ineligible for AQ (p< 0.05). Among donors eligible for the AQ, those who received the FQ had slightly more MHD and PED than those who received the AQ (p< 0.05), but there was no difference in RSCT.

4924,"BACKGROUND: Concerted efforts have been directed toward recruitment of community rather than replacement donors in Brazil. Time trends and demographic correlates of human immunodeficiency (HIV) prevalence and incidence among first-time (FT) donors in Brazil were examined by donation type. HIV residual risk from FT-donor transfusions, and projected yield of p24 antigen and nucleic acid test (NAT) screening were estimated.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: HIV prevalence data and seroreactive specimens were obtained at Fundação Pró-Sangue/Hemocentro-de-São Paulo from 1995 to 2001. To estimate incidence, confirmed-positive samples from July 1998 through December 2001 were tested with a less-sensitive (detuned) enzyme immunoassay to detect recent seroconversions. Incidence data were used to estimate residual risk and p24 and NAT yield based on published window periods (WPs). RESULTS: HIV prevalence was 22 percent higher among the FT community donors than replacement donors (19.6 vs. 16.1 per 10,000; p< 0.01) and 48 percent higher among men than women (19.1 vs. 12.9; p< 0.01). In the multivariable logistic regression, both variables remained significant predictors of HIV prevalence. HIV prevalence decreased from 20.4 (1995) to 13.1 per 10,000 FT donations (2001). HIV incidence was 2.7 per 10,000 person-years. The estimated rate of infected antibodynegative donations was 14.9 per 1,000,000 units (95% confidence interval, 9.8-20.0).

4930,"Prevention of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis B virus (HBV) has historically relied on serological screening of blood donors using progressively more sensitive HBsAg assays; in some countries anti-HBc assays have also been employed to detect chronic carriers with low-level viremia who lack detectable HBsAg. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for HCV and HIV has been successfully introduced to screen donors in many developed countries over the past several years; for logistical and cost reasons HCV/HIV NAT screening has been applied to mini-pools (MP) of eight to 96 donor specimens, with only minimal impact of MP dilutions on clinical sensitivity for interdiction of window period (WP) donations. In several countries (e.g., Japan and Germany), HBV NAT has been added to HIV/HCV MP-NAT blood donor screening with small incremental yields of HBsAg/anti-HBc-negative donations, and the major vendors of NAT systems (Roche and Chiron/Gen-Probe) have been developing triplex assays that include HBV DNA detection capacity without compromising HIV or HCV detection. Pooled specimen HBV NAT has also become the standard of practice for screening source plasma donors, with pressure to include HBV DNA detection as a required procedure for use of recovered plasma in manufacture of fractionated derivatives.

4931,"BACKGROUND: The yield of HIV p24 antigen testing implemented in March 1996 has been lower than projected. One possible explanation is that HIV seroconverting donors delay their return because of the recent practice of risk behaviors and/or signs and symptoms associated with primary infection.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From a database of6.8-million allogeneic donations collected at five US blood centers from 1991 to 1997, 49 HIV, 21 HCV, 32 HTLV, and 44 HBsAg seroconverters with at least three donations were identified. A statistical method was developed to investigate whether the time between a donor’s last negative donation and their positive donation was significantly longer than expected based on their previous return history.RESULTS: HIV seroconverters returned on average 42 percent later than expected (p< 0.01). Although not significant, HCV seroconverters donated on average 43 percent earlier than expected. HTLV and HBsAg seroconverters did not appear to change their donation pattern around the time of seroconversion. Sixty-three percent of the HIV seroconverters later acknowledged practicing a high-risk behavior. CONCLUSIONS: HIV seroconverters delay their return around the time of seroconversion and are thus less likely to be recently infected. Unique among HIV seroconverters, this observation provides a possible explanation for the lower than expected yield of HIV p24 antigen testing and suggests that NAT may have a similar low yield.",George B Schreiber and Simone A Glynn and Glen A Satten and Fanhui Kong and David Wright and Michael P Busch and Yongling Tu and Steven H Kleinman,1,2598076732460623141,Transfusion,,414-421,,BLOOD DONORS AND BLOOD COLLECTION,https://www.academia.edu/download/46065819/HIV_seroconverting_donors_delay_their_re20160530-21300-1yhk7jl.pdf,42,2002,/scholar?cites=2598076732460623141,11F_c5oAAAAJ:Weau3kkTRIMC

Therefore, it seemed of interest to obtain information on where a haemovigilance system has already been established, where it is intended to be established in the near future, on the nature of the systems as well as to collect information on results of haemovigilance obtained so far.",Lorna M Williamson and Michael Busch and Mary Chamberland and Jay Epstein and Steven Kleinman and Rima Khabbaz and George Nemo and Joëlle Debeir and Luc Noel and Jean-Patrice Aullen and Catherine Frette and Fatih Sari and Mai Phuong Vo Mai and Alain Cosson and J de Wildt-Eggen and JG Schrijver and PA Kuiper-Kramer and M Bins and HC van Prooijen and Hagop Bessos and Maureen Hofner and Ahmed Salamat and David Wilson and Stan Urbaniak and Marc L Turner and Ewa Brojer and Piotr Grabarczyk and Stanisław Łopaciuk and Zofia Moraczewska and Barbara Żupańska and Joachim Riggert and Dariough Hagchenas and Ulrich T Seyfert and Frank Boulton and J Case and DS Ford and A Chung and R Collins and S Kochman and T Mazda and M Overbeeke and Ian MacGregor and James Hope and Geoff Barnard and Louise Kirby and Olive Drummond and Duncan Pepper and Valerie Hornsey and Robin Barclay and Marc Turner and Christopher Prowse and R Perera and T Sakuldamrongpanich and M Scott and D Voak and B Żupańska,1,2790967491447488363,Vox Sanguinis,2,110-120,Karger Publishers,Haemovigilance systems,https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/31088,77,1999,/scholar?cites=2790967491447488363,11F_c5oAAAAJ:s_OEDnM-dbEC

4943,"In their provocative editorial in TRANSFUSION, Busch and Alter’estimated the cost of preventing a single transfusion transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a p24 antigen-positive and antibody-negative, seroconverting donor. Using a projected cost per year of $75 to $100 million dollars and calculating the interception of 5 to 10 antigen-positive and antibody-negative units per year as a result of p24 antigen testing, they estimated a cost of $10 million (range, $7.5-$20 million) per HIV transmission prevented.’The flaw in this estimation is the failure to consider that three components are generally manufactured from a single donation. Accordingly, the number of infected recipients would be triple the number of intercepted seroconverting donors, or about 15 to 30 infected recipients per year. The numbers rise further with recognition that as many as four neonates can receive transfusions from a single …",Daniel N Mendelson and S Gerald Sandler and Michael P Busch and Harvey J Alter and F Le Pont and D Costagliola and C Rouzroux and AJ Valleron,1,1922342993183813405,Transfusion,4,382-384,Blackwell Science Ltd,Testing for human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1996.36496226156.x,36,1996,/scholar?cites=1922342993183813405,11F_c5oAAAAJ:QsKbpXNoaWkC
