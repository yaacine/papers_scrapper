It is also observed that change in cation or anion alters the physiochemical properties of the ionic liquids, which in turn influence the enzymatic reactions by altering the structure, activity, enatioselectivity, and stability of the enzymes. Thus, it is utmost need of the researchers to have full understanding of these influences created by ionic liquids before choosing or developing an ionic liquid to serve as solvent media for enzymatic reaction or protein preservation.

The unstructured form of data from the social media is needed to be analyzed and well-structured and for this purpose, sentiment analysis has recognized significant attention. Sentiment analysis is referred as text organization that is used to classify the expressed mind-set or feelings in different manners such as negative, positive, favorable, unfavorable, thumbs up, thumbs down, etc. The challenge for sentiment analysis is lack of sufficient labeled data in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). And to solve this issue, the sentiment analysis and deep learning techniques have been merged because deep learning models are effective due to their automatic learning capability.

9110,"Measures such as energy curtailment or grid reinforcement are required to integrate the upcoming wind generation in parts of the power system with existing transmission bottlenecks. In order to choose between these two measures potential wind energy curtailments and its costs need to be carefully evaluated. The paper analyzes the effect of wake consideration on the overall energy curtailment cost. For this purpose detailed wake model was used taking into account partial and multiple shading of wind turbines. It is shown that not only wind speed but also wind direction of the incoming wind affects the amount of energy produced by a wind farm. A comparison of curtailment cost with cost for grid reinforcement in areas with limited transmission capacity was carried out with and without consideration of wake effect. The effect on curtailment cost due to availability of wind turbines is also investigated both with and without wake effect consideration. The results have proven that with consideration of wake effect and availability potential wind energy curtailments are reduced and hence curtailment costs are lowered, making curtailment a cheaper option than grid reinforcement. The method illustrated in the paper can be used in pre-feasibility study to compare the costs of wind curtailment with the costs of grid reinforcement in order to make sound economic decision.

Patients were followed weekly during treatment and for 12 weeks after treatment withdrawal.ResultsDuring treatment, wetting frequencies were significantly reduced in all groups and remained significantly lower than pretreatment values until the end of follow-up. In the D and EA/D groups, an immediate reduction in wetting frequencies was observed, whereas a longer time was required to reach a significant reduction in the EA group. The full and partial response rates were 13.3% and 37.8% in the EA group, 26.1% and 43.5% in the D group, and 40.0% and 33.3% in the EA/D group.

Twelve forage species, namely, Trifolium alexandrinum, Cichorium intybus, Hordeum vulgare L., Medicago sativa, Avena sativa, Pennisetum purpureum Setaria anceps, Sorghum almum, Panicum maximum, Rumex nepalensis, Panicum coloratum and Panicum antidotale were evaluated. Each forage species was grown in four replicate plots under standard agronomic conditions, and sampled at early, normal and late stages of maturity. The result of the present study showed that the chemical composition, dry matter digestibility and FA contents varied (P <0.001) among forage species and harvest maturity. Linolenic acid (C18:3n-3), palmitic acid (C16:0) and linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) were the predominant FAs with an average content of 8.65, 3.61 and 2.38 g/kg dry matter (DM), contributing on average to 53%, 22% and 14% of the total measured FAs, respectively. Among the individual FAs, C18:3n-3 had the largest variation ranging from 4.26 to 17.43 g/kg DM at first harvest.

9134,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is the third most important cereal crop of Pakistan after wheat and rice serving the purpose of food, feed and fodder in the country (Khaliq et al., 2010). It is sown on an area of 9.39 million hectares with total annual production of 3.341 million tons and national average yield is 3.56 tons per hectare (Anonymous, 2011). Maize having a C4 mode of carbon fixation shows rapid growth, producing large quantity of organic matter and has a higher demand for P. Maize is a phospho-positive crop and it accumulates phosphorous throughout the growing season with the highest uptake between third and sixth week of growth. Phosphorus accumulated in the leaves tends to reach a maximum about middle of the growing season and decreases as the plant matures.In Pakistan, P is one of the major mineral nutrient needed by plants, but it is mostly inaccessible nutrient present is soils (Holford, 1997). Being the most likely to be fixed mineral nutrient in many cropping environments, P availability to plant is also very low. Application of inorganic phosphatic fertilizers over the years, continuously, leads to build phosphorous, leading to a negligible response. It is in fact a “finite and irreplaceable” mineral. Its known reserves, which are economically viable for exploitation, could run out in 60 to 100 years if current pace of its global consumption continues and without P there will be no agriculture (Osava, 2007). Like different arid regions of the world, about 80 to 90% soils of Pakistan are deficient in available P (NFDC, 2001).

On the contrary, the PCR-RFLP-based method correctly identified all 4 genotype A but only 56 of 63 genotype D strains. Seven genotype D strains yielded indeterminate results. DNA sequence comparisons showed that a single nucleotide change in the target region generated an additional restriction site for Nla IV that compromised the accuracy of this method.

This research used data from 336 non-financial firms over the period of 5 years (2005-2009). This study used fixed effect random model regression analysis to analyze determinants of capital structure. The results showed that industry type play important role in determining capital structure. The results showed that out of eight variables five (size, tangibility of assets, non-debt tax shields, liquidity and payout) are statistically significantly related to leverage, remaining three are statistically insignificantly related with leverage. Two expected relation are accepted while six are rejected after empirical analysis. This study identifies that industry type, liquidity and payout ratio play important role, whereas tax does not play important role in identifying capital structure Pakistani non-financial firms.",Fawad Ahmad and Rao Umer Nasir and Mohsin Ali and Wasim Ullah,30,11057974893600404122,African Journal of Business Management,28,11375-11385,,Extension of determinants of capital structure: Evidence from Pakistani non-financial firms,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1964901,5,2011,/scholar?cites=11057974893600404122,ggyoQ3UAAAAJ:CNPyR2KL9-0C

Based on electronic absorbance values obtained from dyes in filtrate solutions, dye solutions having similar absorbance values were prepared using the stock. A comparison of the two spectra for each dye also confirmed the identity of the dye in the filtrate to be the same. On the basis of these measurements, it can be concluded that the structures of the dyes after being precipitation remained the same. However, an exchange of the anion of the dye with that of ionic liquid can not be ruled out. Our next goal was to calculate the efficiency of this precipitation process.

In most of the previous studies, the impact of these hydraulic parameters on transport capacity was studied for non-erodible bed conditions. Hence, this study aimed to examine the influence of unit discharge, mean flow velocity and slope gradient on sediment transport capacity for erodible beds and also to investigate the relationship between transport capacity and composite force predictors i.e. shear stress, stream power, unit stream power and effective stream power. In order to accomplish the objectives, experiments were carried out using four well sorted sands (0.230, 0.536, 0.719, 1.022 mm). Unit discharges ranging from 0.07 to 2.07 × 10-3 m2 s-1 were simulated inside the flume at four slopes (5.2, 8.7, 13.2 and 17.6 %) to analyze their impact on sediment transport rate. The sediment transport rate measured at the bottom end of the flume by taking water and sediment samples was considered equal to sediment transport capacity, because the selected flume length of 3.0 m was found sufficient to reach the transport capacity. The experimental result reveals that the slope gradient has a stronger impact on transport capacity than unit discharge and mean flow velocity due to the fact that the tangential component of gravity force increases with slope gradient. Our results show that unit stream power is an optimal composite force predictor for estimating transport capacity.

9188,"Background: Early detection of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may save lives. In the emergency setting, it is unclear whether the early use of certain cardiac markers (myoglobin and cardiac troponin I [cTnI]) assists in making appropriate decisions whether to admit or discharge patients with chest pain of possible ischemic cause who have nondiagnostic electrocardiograms (ECGs). We performed a study to determine whether the addition of new cardiac markers in the emergency department results in improved clinical decisions.Methods: A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 1997 and June 1998 in a tertiary care emergency department in Kingston, Ont. Of 296 patients aged 30 years or more who presented to the emergency department with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECGs, 146 were randomly assigned to the intervention group (determination of baseline creatine kinase [CK] level, CK MB fraction and cTnI level, and myoglobin level at baseline and at 2 hours) and 150 to the control group (determination of baseline CK level and CK MB fraction).

The importance of data validation in monitoring bottom sediment was recognized. The effect of grain size distribution and of spatial variations in the bottom sediment justified a sound sampling and analytical protocol.Analysing the clay-silt fraction to reduce the effect of grain size was shown to be reliable. Before monitoring, however, one should prove that bottom sediment characteristics are homogeneous horizontally around the sampling site.

Use of fuzzy logic based techniques is capturing more focus since last decade to deal with these challenges. In order to tackle conflicting issues of noise smoothing and detail preservation, this paper presents a novel approach using adaptive fuzzy inference system for random valued impulse noise detection and removal. The proposed filter uses the intensity based directional statistics to construct adaptive fuzzy membership functions which plays an important role in fuzzy inference system.

9214,"Polyetheretherketones (PEEK) have been increasingly employed as biomaterials for trauma, orthopedic, and spinal implants. These implants are commonly fabricated by extrusion and injection molding, and for this fact, additional machining operations are required. Surface roughness is a vital factor for medical implants since the cells of the surrounding tissue interact with the underlying substrate on the micro and nanometer scales. For some application, such as self-mating articulation cervical disc implants smooth surface finish is critical so as to minimize the contact friction and wear. The requirement for a fine surface roughness poses a major concern in machining of polymeric base materials due to its low thermal conductivity. Machining performance such as surface roughness is directly affected by the milling parameter and should be methodically analyzed. Thus, this paper aims to study the effect of milling parameter on surface roughness of PEEK plastic under dry machining condition. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique was used to evaluate the influence of milling parameter namely cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on machined surface. From the conducted study, based on the statistical analysis result it is found that feed rate is the main factor that influence the surface roughness followed by milling speed and depth of cut. In addition, optical observation on the machined surface indicated that the mechanisms of the surface finish obtained from machining of polymeric based composites are different from those obtained from machining of the metals.

Peach is susceptible to various types of pathogens that result in decline of its fruit production. An important pathogen, Agrobacterium tumefaciens attacks on peach plant and it causes crown gall disease. The present study was conducted to identify the peach plants infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens and isolate as well as identify the bacterium from the crown gall samples. These samples were collected from different locations including district Swat and Shangla. The bacterium was isolated from the samples using MacConkey selection media that is used specifically for identification of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Two different biochemical tests ie Gram staining and KOH test were performed to confirm that the isolated bacterium is gram negative. The biochemical tests reveal that all the bacterial isolates are gram negative. Furthermore, two pathogenicity tests ie potato disc and carrot disc bioassay were conducted that confirmed the isolates causing tumors in the infected plant tissues. Antibiotic sensitivity tests reveal that the bacterial isolates are resistant to rifampicin antibiotic. All the morphological as well as the biochemical features of the bacterial isolates suggested that the samples isolated from crown galls were Agrobacterium tumefaciens.

In Bacillus, the intracellular level and turnover of c-di-AMP is mainly regulated by three diadenylate cyclases (DACs), including DisA, CdaA and CdaS, and one c-di-AMP-specific phosphodiesterase. In this study, we demonstrated that CdaS protein from B. thuringiensisis is a hexameric DAC protein that can convert ATP or ADP to c-di-AMP in vitro and the N-terminal YojJ domain was essential for the DAC activity. Based on the markerless gene knock-out method, we demonstrated that the transcription of cdaS was initiated by the sporulation-specific sigma factor σH and the deletion of cdaS significantly delayed sporulation and parasporal crystal formation. These findings contrast with similar experiments conducted using B. subtilis, wherein transcription of its cdaS was initiated by the sigma factor σG. Deletion of all the three DAC genes from a single strain was unsuccessful, suggesting that c-di-AMP is an indispensable molecule in B. thuringiensis.

Further, we find that concentration is beneficial for the banking stability of both types of banks. In most of our results, we found no difference in the impact of competition and diversification on the stability of conventional and Islamic banks.
