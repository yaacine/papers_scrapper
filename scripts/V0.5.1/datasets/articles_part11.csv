11035,"These guidelines represent an update of those published in 1996 and are intended for physicians who are involved in the preoperative, operative, and postoperative care of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. They provide a framework for considering cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery in a variety of patient and surgical situations. The overriding theme of these guidelines is that preoperative intervention is rarely necessary simply to lower the risk of surgery unless such intervention is indicated irrespective of the preoperative context. The purpose of preoperative evaluation is not simply to give medical clearance but rather to perform an evaluation of the patient’s current medical status; make recommendations concerning the evaluation, management, and risk of cardiac problems over the entire perioperative period; and provide a clinical risk profile that the patient, primary physician, anesthesiologist, and surgeon …",Committee Members and Kim A Eagle and Peter B Berger and Hugh Calkins and Bernard R Chaitman and Gordon A Ewy and Kirsten E Fleischmann and Lee A Fleisher and James B Froehlich and Richard J Gusberg and Jeffrey A Leppo and Thomas Ryan and Robert C Schlant and William L Winters Jr and Raymond J Gibbons and Elliott M Antman and Joseph S Alpert and David P Faxon and Valentin Fuster and Gabriel Gregoratos and Alice K Jacobs and Loren F Hiratzka and Richard O Russell and Sidney C Smith Jr,2084,9943471103276575977,,10,1257-1267,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,ACC/AHA guideline update for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation for noncardiac surgery—executive summary a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart …,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.105.10.1257,105,2002,/scholar?cites=9943471103276575977,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:F_tUKv7nyWgC

This paper reports, for the first time, the distribution of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (VDR), and 1α-hydroxylase (1α-OHase), the enzyme responsible for the formation of the active vitamin in the human brain. The receptor and the enzyme were found in both neurons and glial cells in a regional and layer-specific pattern. The VDR was restricted to the nucleus whilst 1α-OHase was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. The distribution of the VDR in human brain was strikingly similar to that reported in rodents. Many regions contained equivalent amounts of both the VDR and 1α-OHase, however the macrocellular cells within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) and the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum expressed 1α-OHase in the absence of …",Darryl W Eyles and Steven Smith and Robert Kinobe and Martin Hewison and John J McGrath,1337,1794256898392905619,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,1,21-30,Elsevier,Distribution of the vitamin D receptor and 1α-hydroxylase in human brain,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891061804001176,29,2005,/scholar?cites=1794256898392905619,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:SFOYbPikdlgC

However, it was not until the beginning of the 20th century that the first clinical descriptions appeared describing a connection between the formation of a thrombus in a coronary artery and its associated clinical features (2, 3). Despite these landmark observations, considerable time elapsed before general clinical acceptance of this entity was achieved, in part due to one autopsy study that showed no thrombi in the coronary arteries of 31% of deceased patients with an MI (4).

In addition, the safety and efficacy of long-term application of topical capsaicin in PHN was assessed by following patients in an open-label study for up to 2 years. In the double-blind phase, 143 patients with PHN of 6 months' duration or longer were enrolled. Since epidemiologic studies of patients who receive no treatment have shown that only 10% to 25% of those with PHN after 1 month will still have pain at 1 year, two separate efficacy analyses were performed: one with all evaluable patients (n= 131) and the other with 93 patients whose PHN lasted for longer than 12 months prior to study startup. All efficacy variables, including the physician's global evaluation of reduction in PHN pain, changes in pain severity on the categoric scale, visual analogue scale for pain severity, visual analogue scale for pain relief, and functional capacity scale, showed significant improvement at nearly all time points throughout the study for both patient groups, based on duration of PHN pain. In contrast, the group receiving vehicle cream remained essentially unchanged. Data from the long-term, open-label phase (up to 2 years, n= 77), which immediately followed the 6-week blinded phase, showed that the clinical benefit in patients treated for a short (6-week) period with topical capsaicin could be maintained or amplified in most patients (86%) during prolonged therapy.

Our study compared the renal allograft survival of patients with AHR treated with plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with allograft survival in patients with acute cellular rejection (ACR).Methods. We retrospectively analyzed all kidney transplants performed at our institution between January 1999 and August 2001 (n= 286). Recipients were classified into three groups according to biopsy reports: AHR, ACR, or no rejection. The ACR group was further divided into early and late rejection (< 90 and> 90 days posttransplant, respectively).Results. After a mean follow-up of 569±19 days, the incidence of AHR was 5.6%(n= 16).

We sought to determine whether racial/ethnic differences in evidence-based acute myocardial infarction care persist among hospitals participating in a national quality improvement program.Methods and Results—We analyzed 142 593 acute myocardial infarction patients (121 528 whites, 10 882 blacks, and 10 183 Hispanics) at 443 hospitals participating in the Get With the Guidelines–Coronary Artery Disease (GWTG-CAD) program between January 2002 and June 2007. We examined individual and overall composite rates of defect-free care, defined as the proportion of patients receiving all eligible performance measures. In addition, we examined temporal trends in use of performance measures according to race/ethnicity by calendar quarter. Overall, individual performance measure use was high, ranging from 78% for use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to 96% for use of aspirin at discharge. Use of each of these improved significantly over the 5 years of study. Overall, defect-free care was 80.9% for whites, 79.5% for Hispanics (adjusted odds ratio versus whites 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.06, P 0.94), and 77.7% for blacks (adjusted odds ratio versus whites 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.98, P 0.01). A significant gap in defect-free care was observed for blacks mostly during the first half of the study, which was no longer present during the remainder of the study.

11184,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, the use of wild type native FGF21 is challenging due to several limitations. Among these are its short half-life, its susceptibility to in vivo proteolytic degradation and its propensity to in vitro aggregation. We here describe a rationale-based protein engineering approach to generate a potent long-acting FGF21 analog with improved resistance to proteolysis and aggregation. A recombinant Fc-FGF21 fusion protein was constructed by fusing the Fc domain of human IgG1 to the N-terminus of human mature FGF21 via a linker peptide. The Fc positioned at the N-terminus was determined to be superior to the C-terminus as the N-terminal Fc fusion retained the βKlotho binding affinity and the in vitro and in vivo potency similar to native FGF21. Two specific point mutations were introduced into FGF21. The leucine to arginine substitution at position 98 (L98R) suppressed FGF21 aggregation at high concentrations and elevated temperatures. The proline to glycine replacement at position 171 (P171G) eliminated a site-specific proteolytic cleavage of FGF21 identified in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. The derived Fc-FGF21(RG) molecule demonstrated a significantly improved circulating half-life while maintaining the in vitro activity similar to that of wild type protein. The half-life of Fc-FGF21(RG) was 11 h in mice and 30 h in monkeys as compared to 1-2 h for native FGF21 or Fc-FGF21 wild type.

11187,"Myocardial infarction (MI) can be recognised by clinical features, including electrocardiographic (ECG) findings, elevated values of biochemical markers (biomarkers) of myocardial necrosis, and by imaging, or may be defined by pathology. It is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. MI may be the first manifestation of coronary artery disease (CAD) or it may occur, repeatedly, in patients with established disease. Information on MI rates can provide useful information regarding the burden of CAD within and across populations, especially if standardized data are collected in a manner that distinguishes between incident and recurrent events. From the epidemiological point of view, the incidence of MI in a population can be used as a proxy for the prevalence of CAD in that population. The term ‘myocardial infarction’may have major psychological and legal implications for the individual and society. It is an indicator of one of the leading health problems in the world and it is an outcome measure in clinical trials, observational studies and quality assurance programmes.

11193,"The effects of coronary artery bypass graft (CAB) and coronary collaterals (CC) on myocardial blood flow (MBF) were studied in 24 patients undergoing 29 CAB's. MBF after CAB was compared to preexisting MBF by intraoperatively injecting 133xenon via distal CAB with proximal CAB first occluded then open. Pressure gradients across bypassed obstructions were measured. The results were correlated with preoperative coronary arteriograms to determine the effects of CC on MBF and postobstructive perfusion pressures. Mean MBF was increased by CAB from 32±6 (se) ml/min per 100 g (CAB occluded) to 118±13 ml/min per 100 g (CAB open). The 133Xe clearance curves with CAB open were resolved into slow (19±2 ml/min per 100 g) and rapid (133±12 ml/min per 100 g) phases, suggesting that MBF remained heterogeneous after CAB.

Intensity-damage curves generated for each wave-band indicated that UVA light was 50-80 times more effective than green light at causing photoreceptor cell losses. Examination of early ultrastructural changes in rod inner segments, outer segments, and retinal pigment epithelium revealed a remarkable degree of similarity between UVA and green light-induced damage. Furthermore, the two classes of damage were indistinguishable in terms of post-exposure recovery from threshold damage and regional distribution of photoreceptor cell loss along the vertical meridian.

Thus, ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that fibrinolysis be provided within 30 minutes of first medical system contact and that primary PCI be provided within 90 minutes of first medical system contact for patients presenting with STEMI. 1 These guideline recommendations have been translated into performance measures that are reported to the public by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Joint Commission. 2, 3 …",WRITING COMMITTEE MEMBERS and Frederick A Masoudi and Robert O Bonow and Ralph G Brindis and Christopher P Cannon and Jo DeBuhr and Susan Fitzgerald and Paul A Heidenreich and Kalon KL Ho and Harlan M Krumholz and Chris Leber and David J Magid and David S Nilasena and John S Rumsfeld and Sidney C Smith Jr and Thomas P Wharton Jr,88,3990138360382566471,,24,2649-2661,Lippincott Williams & Wilkins,ACC/AHA 2008 statement on Performance Measurement and Reperfusion Therapy: a report of the ACC/AHA Task Force on Performance Measures (Work Group to address the challenges of …,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.191100,118,2008,/scholar?cites=3990138360382566471,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:9PmR9Y676FQC

The goal of additional noninvasive imaging for atherosclerosis is to improve identification of individuals at a high or low risk for CHD (ie, optimize risk stratification so as few patients as possible are classified as intermediate risk). This presumes that such classification can aid physicians in prescribing a management strategy for prevention, in that patients assigned into a “high-risk” category will likely benefit from aggressive risk-factor modification, while those at low risk will less likely benefit.

Since then, the constituents of hormonal OCs have changed and now contain lower doses of oestrogen and progestagen. Current recommendations restrict OC use to younger women who do not have other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, in this international study we assessed the risk of CC-associated first stroke in women from Europe and other countries throughout Vie world.Methods In this hospital-based, case-control study, we assessed the risk of ischaemic stroke in association with current use of combined OCs in 697 cases, aged 20-44 years, and 1962 age-matched hospital controls in 21 centres in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The diagnosis of ischaemic stroke was almost exclusively based on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or cerebral angiography carried out within 3 weeks of the clinical event. Ail cases and controls were interviewed while in hospital with the same questionnaire, which included information on medical and personal history, details of lifetime contraceptive use, and blood-pressure measurements before the most recent episode of OC use.Findings The overall odds ratio of ischaemic stroke was 2 . 99 (95% CI 1 . 65-5 . 40) in Europe and 2 . 93 (2 . 15-4 . 00) in the non-European (developing) countries, Odds ratios were lower in younger women and those who did not smoke, and less than 2 in women who did not have hypertension and who reported that their blood pressure had been …",NR Poulter and CL Chang and TMM Farley and O Meirik and Michael Gideon Marmot and Myriam Debert-Ribeiro and Ernesto Medina and Jorge Artigas and He Shen and Yu Hui Zhong and De Wei Zhang and Wei Jin Zhao and Oscar Rojas and Martin Vessey and Lothar Heinemann and Stuart Donnan and Suzanne Ho and Gyorgy Bartfai and J Kisjanto and Rainford Wilks and Reuben Agwanda and Rossario Ruiz and Mateja Kozuh-Novak and Nikorn Dusitsin and Pramuan Virutamasen and Kammant Phanthumcinda and Suporn Koetsawang and Manee Piya-Anant and Jasenka Demirovic and Karen Belkic and WS Mwandila and CM Mutale and Jonathon Matenga and Adrian Wilson and D Petitti and J Perlman and J Keleghan and S Lawley and S Smith and M Shipley and J Olsen and M Thorogood,65,14469972280327802850,Lancet,,,Elsevier BV,"Ischaemic stroke and combined oral contraceptives: results of an international, multicentre, case-control study",http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=14469972280327802850&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1996,/scholar?cites=14469972280327802850,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:66S1BDY1aroC

11255,"Circadian variation of the onset of acute myocardial infarction has been noted in many studies and may carry important pathophysiologic implications. However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analyses. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, the peak of onset occurred in the morning from 6: 01 AM to 12: 00 noon, and 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percentage for the other time periods) experienced symptom onset in that period (p< 0.001). There was a second, lower peak (25%) in the evening between 6: 01 PM and 12: 00 midnight, which was also observed in some previous studies. We sought to determine whether or not the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n= 606) or with non-Q wave infarction (n= 832), a pronounced peak (29% o) occurred only in the evening. Two nearly equal peaks were observed in patients older than 70 years ofage (n= 1,422), smokers (n= 2,057), diabetics (n= 767), women (n= 1,213), and patients taking, B-blocking drugs (n= 847).

11257,"Ingestion of sodium is essential to health, but excess sodium intake is a risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Defining an optimal range of sodium intake in populations has been challenging and controversial. Clinical trials evaluating the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure have shown blood pressure lowering effects down to sodium intake of less than 1.5 g/day. Findings from these blood pressure trials form the basis for current guideline recommendations to reduce sodium intake to less than 2.3 g/day. However, these clinical trials employed interventions that are not feasible for population-wide implementation (i.e. feeding studies or intensive behavioural interventions), particularly in low and middle-income countries.

Shayla questioned if the implications of the Harrison study could be meaningful or even generalizable to her own study. Were Shayla's students not reading because they had knowledge of their poor reading skills and deficits in their reading levels? Did this lead to a poor self concept of themselves as readers?

Plaque fluid is already supersaturated with respect to relevant calcium phosphates at neutral pH; extra calcium may lead to surface-blocking and sub-optimal lesion consolidation. However, at cariogenic pH, lesions may be more porous to the ingress of mineral, leading to fuller consolidation, and controlled release of calcium should reduce undersaturation with respect to enamel and accelerate deposition of fluorhydroxyapatite. Clinical data to validate in vitro screening models are scarce.

METHODS: Available literature was reviewed, including searches via the National Library of medicine database and other sources. RESULTS: A review of the literature indicates that significant progress has been made since Dr. Ethan B. Russo's landmark paper, just ten years ago (February 2, 2004). Investigation at that time suggested that cannabinoids can block spinal, peripheral and gastrointestional mechanisms that promote pain in headache, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and muscle spasm. CONCLUSION: Subsequent research has confirmed that underlying endocannabinoid deficiencies indeed play a role in migraine, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and a growing list of other medical conditions.

11301," Left ventricular end‐diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is an important measure of ventricular performance and may identify patients at increased risk for developing late clinical symptoms of heart failure (HF). The primary outcome in this analysis of 744 patients from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial was the development of death or HF over a mean time of 36 months. The mean LVEDP for all patients was 23±9 mm Hg, and 75% of participants (n=558) had an LVEDP >15 mm Hg. Patients with an LVEDP >30 mm Hg (n=187) had the highest risk of death or HF (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.97) when compared with the other 2 cohorts combined (n=603).

11307,"The major source of carbon for starch synthesis in reserve tissues such as the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tuber is SUC. In the developing tuber, Suc is hydrolyzed principally by Suc synthase (EC 2.4. 1.13) to UDP-Glc and Fru (Preiss, 1982). Fructokinase (EC 2.7. 1.4) is believed to catalyze the phosphorylation of the Fru released to yield Fru-6-P. This sugar phosphate can then be used to support starch synthesis following further metabolism in the cytosol and amyloplast. There are some reports (Wolosiuk and Pontis, 1974) that Suc synthase activity can undergo feedback inhibition by free Fru. In this case fructokinase potentially plays an important role in maintaining the flux of carbon toward starch formation.Fructokinase has been purified from a variety of plants including pea (Tumer et al., 1977; Copeland et al., 1984), barley (Baysdorfer et al., 1989), avocado (Copeland and Tanner, 1988), and developing …",Susan B Smith and Mark A Taylor and Lindsay R Burch and Howard V Davies,48,7116234982962009012,Plant physiology,3,1043,American Society of Plant Biologists,Primary structure and characterization of a cDNA clone of fructokinase from potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv record).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC158880/,102,1993,/scholar?cites=7116234982962009012,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:-3_NAp5WSNkC
11308,"The dose of propranolol which produces the optimal therapeutic effect in patients with angina pectoris has been found to vary widely among patients. Because the plasma concentration of propranolol also differs markedly due to interpatient variability in absorption it seemed possible that this might be the reason for the wide range of effective doses in angina and that plasma propranolol might provide a useful guide to therapeutic response. To examine this possibility we selected ten patients with coronary artery disease complicated by angina and studied them at varying propranolol doses to a maximum of 320 mg/day. Exercise capacity was tested on a treadmill and plasma propranolol concentration was measured by gas liquid chromatography. In seven normal subjects beta-blockade was quantified precisely as inhibition of exercise tachycardia and was related to plasma propranolol levels at various doses. Maximal beta-blockade occurred at 100 ng/ml of plasma propranolol, but the dose response curve of blockade was relatively flat and the ED50 of plasma propranolol was 8+/-1 ng/ml. In the patients maximal therapeutic benefit from propranolol occurred at 30+/-7 ng/ml and at a dose of 144 mg/day. This resulted in an increase in exercise capacity from an estimated 12-7+/-0-8 ml/kg/min of oxygen consumption during control to 17-2+/-1-1 ml/kg/min on the drug. Thus, there was a wide variation of both dose and concentration among these patients at the maximum therapeutic response.

11322,"Purpose: CDK-activating kinase (CAK) is required for the regulation of the cell cycle and is a trimeric complex consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), Cyclin H, and the accessory protein, MAT1. CDK7 also plays a critical role in regulating transcription, primarily by phosphorylating RNA polymerase II, as well as transcription factors such as estrogen receptor-α (ER). Deregulation of cell cycle and transcriptional control are general features of tumor cells, highlighting the potential for the use of CDK7 inhibitors as novel cancer therapeutics.Experimental Design: mRNA and protein expression of CDK7 and its essential cofactors cyclin H and MAT1 were evaluated in breast cancer samples to determine if their levels are altered in cancer.

11323,"The cell-division cycle of Caulobacter crescentus depends on periodic activation and deactivation of the essential response regulator CtrA. Although CtrA is critical for transcription during some parts of the cell cycle, its activity must be eliminated before chromosome replication because CtrA also blocks the initiation of DNA replication. CtrA activity is down-regulated both by dephosphorylation and by proteolysis, mediated by the ubiquitous ATP-dependent protease ClpXP. Here we demonstrate that proteins needed for rapid CtrA proteolysis in vivo form a phosphorylation-dependent and cyclic diguanylate (cdG)-dependent adaptor complex that accelerates CtrA degradation in vitro by ClpXP.

However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation -- no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low noise level. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a Markov random field whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be observed through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model.

Other chapters cover climatic influences, emphasising temperate versus tropical contrasts, and demographic processes underlying population dynamics, more generally. There are new assessments of irruptive population dynamics, and of the consequences of landscape heterogeneity for herbivore populations. An initial review of candidate population models is followed up by a final chapter outlining how these models might be modified to better accommodate environmental variability.

11345,"English language learners (ELLs) in today's US middle schools and high schools face significant challenges from state writing assessments, and data suggest that they do not fare well. This paper seeks to uncover some of the reasons by posing the question: What is the available research base and practice literature to help teachers prepare ELLs to meet the standards? The answer this question begins by collecting the writing standards from each state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; identifying major topics and themes in the standards; and reducing the total number of standards to a set of six categories that could be used to assess the research and practice literature. An extensive search was then conducted of the research and practice literature published between 1995 and 2005 that addresses adolescents, second language learning, and writing. Although the literature is extensive, only a small portion addresses US resident and immigrant ELLs in grades 7 through 13. Several historical factors that have resulted in these gaps were found:(1) Research has focused largely on post secondary and international student populations, with little focus on US resident and immigrant middle and high school students;(2) ESL teacher preparation programs focus largely on oral language development; and (3) Secondary school English teacher preparation programs rarely address working with second language learners. In addition to limiting the field of research available for review, the factors above may account for the wide gap between ELL students' writing skills and those of their English-speaking peers.

The binding profile of each anti-adipocyte antibody has been characterised using phage antibody immunocytochemistry against a panel of normal human tissues. Although there was some variation in the intensity of the adipocyte staining, each antibody consistently recognised adipocytes, where present, irrespective of the tissue source. In addition, all of the antibodies recognised at least one other cell type other than the adipocyte cell surface. In total, over 50 different tissue-binding profiles were recorded, with the most frequently recognised tissues identified as …",Bryan M Edwards and Sarah H Main and Kathryn L Cantone and Steven D Smith and Anthony Warford and Tristan J Vaughan,36,1137507873660529574,Journal of immunological methods,1-2,67-78,Elsevier,Isolation and tissue profiles of a large panel of phage antibodies binding to the human adipocyte cell surface,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175900002751,245,2000,/scholar?cites=1137507873660529574,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:za7pDTvVV8kC

Sixteen of the patients (84 percent) showed 50 percent or greater reduction in inflammatory lesions, while fifteen (79 percent) demonstrated a reduction in erythema severity and an improvement when evaluated by the investigator global assessment. No positive response was recorded for any patient prior to topical medication, whereas six of nine patients previously treated with tetracycline/minocycline demonstrated improvement. Seven of these nine patients responded to topical metronidazole treatment. One additional patient who did not respond to minocycline or desonide treatment showed a good response to topical metronidazole. Only one patient reported local irritation after using metronidazole.

11370,"Umbilical cord blood banking efforts have increased dramatically in the past two decades in response to increasing demand for alternative sources of blood stem cells to support patients requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Transplant centres have accumulated increasing expertise in their understanding of umbilical cord blood characteristics that are associated with improved outcome following transplantation. These characteristics and factors can assist transplant centres in selecting cord blood units from the worldwide inventory of banked units. Umbilical cord blood banks, therefore, need to remain agile in adjusting the inventory of the banks to address shifts or changes in the needs of transplant centres. Public umbilical cord blood banks face the challenge of building inventory while managing limited resources and are faced with decisions regarding which units can be stored and which units that have been collected should be discarded or used for other endeavours such as research. To this end, we sought to review parameters influencing the decision to bank a collected cord blood unit. In this paper, we will address parameters associated with graft potency and address other factors that guide the decision to bank collected units.",David Allan and Tanya Petraszko and Heidi Elmoazzen and Susan Smith,35,3415232974876689692,,,,Hindawi,A review of factors influencing the banking of collected umbilical cord blood units,https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sci/2013/463031/abs/,2013,2013,/scholar?cites=3415232974876689692,RYTQf_0AAAAJ:6syOTa9L3GQC
