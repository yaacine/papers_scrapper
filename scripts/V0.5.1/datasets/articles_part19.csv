19000,"The fuzzy set was conceived as a result of an attempt to come to grips with the problem of pattern recognition in the context of imprecisely defined categories. In such cases, the belonging of an object to a class is a matter of degree, as is the question of whether or not a group of objects form a cluster. A pioneering application of the theory of fuzzy sets to cluster analysis was made in 1969 by Ruspini. It was not until 1973, however, when the appearance of the work by Dunn and Bezdek on the Fuzzy ISODATA (or fuzzy c-means) algorithms became a landmark in the theory of cluster analysis, that the relevance of the theory of fuzzy sets to cluster analysis and pattern recognition became clearly established. Since then, the theory of fuzzy clustering has developed rapidly and fruitfully, with the author of the present monograph contributing a major share of what we know today. In their seminal work, Bezdek and Dunn have introduced the basic idea of determining the fuzzy clusters by minimizing an appropriately defined functional, and have derived iterative algorithms for computing the membership functions for the clusters in question. The important issue of convergence of such algorithms has become much better understood as a result of recent work which is described in the monograph.",James C Bezdek,20956,4309718249920630000,,,,Springer Science & Business Media,Pattern recognition with fuzzy objective function algorithms,http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=z6XqBwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR14&dq=info:8IyJGOoxzzsJ:scholar.google.com&ots=0iWOuZFhDo&sig=EVxq9Hv_9sJ8rDx0ijlf7C-RKHo,,2013,/scholar?cites=4309718249920630000,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:s2G-WRnXBicC
19001,"This paper transmits a FORTRAN-IV coding of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering program. The FCM program is applicable to a wide variety of geostatistical data analysis problems. This program generates fuzzy partitions and prototypes for any set of numerical data. These partitions are useful for corroborating known substructures or suggesting substructure in unexplored data. The clustering criterion used to aggregate subsets is a generalized least-squares objective function. Features of this program include a choice of three norms (Euclidean, Diagonal, or Mahalonobis), an adjustable weighting factor that essentially controls sensitivity to noise, acceptance of variable numbers of clusters, and outputs that include several measures of cluster validity.",James C Bezdek and Robert Ehrlich and William Full,5185,8050684385299829334,Computers & Geosciences,2-3,191-203,Pergamon,FCM: The fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm,https://staff.fmi.uvt.ro/~daniela.zaharie/dm2019/EN/projects/biblio/FuzzyCMeans/FCM%20-%20The%20Fuzzy%20c-Means%20Clustering%20Algorithm.pdf,10,1984,/scholar?cites=8050684385299829334,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC
19002,"Many functionals have been proposed for validation of partitions of object data produced by the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. We examine the role a subtle but important parameter-the weighting exponent m of the FCM model-plays in determining the validity of FCM partitions. The functionals considered are the partition coefficient and entropy indexes of Bezdek, the Xie-Beni (1991), and extended Xie-Beni indexes, and the Fukuyama-Sugeno index (1989). Limit analysis indicates, and numerical experiments confirm, that the Fukuyama-Sugeno index is sensitive to both high and low values of m and may be unreliable because of this. Of the indexes tested, the Xie-Beni index provided the best response over a wide range of choices for the number of clusters, (2-10), and for m from 1.01-7.

19009,Multiple classifier fusion may generate more accurate classification than each of the constituent classifiers. Fusion is often based on fixed combination rules like the product and average. Only under strict probabilistic conditions can these rules be justified. We present here a simple rule for adapting the class combiner to the application. c decision templates (one per class) are estimated with the same training set that is used for the set of classifiers. These templates are then matched to the decision profile of new incoming objects by some similarity measure. We compare 11 versions of our model with 14 other techniques for classifier fusion on the Satimage and Phoneme datasets from the database ELENA. Our results show that decision templates based on integral type measures of similarity are superior to the other schemes on both data sets.,Ludmila I Kuncheva and James C Bezdek and Robert PW Duin,1195,17778516152451076028,Pattern recognition,2,299-314,Pergamon,Decision templates for multiple classifier fusion: an experimental comparison,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003132039900223X,34,2001,/scholar?cites=17778516152451076028,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC

19013,"This paper reports the results of a numerical comparison of two versions of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms.

This approximation enables AFCM to exploit a lookup table approach for computing Euclidean distances and for exponentiation. The net effect of the proposed implementation is that CPU time during each iteration is reduced to approximately one sixth of the time required for a literal implementation of the algorithm, while apparently preserving the overall quality of terminal clusters produced.

This is not an objective definition, but a definition that is easy to understand and one that is practical, because there is a dataset too big for any computer you might use; hence, this is VL data for you. Clustering is one of the primary tasks used in the pattern recognition and data mining communities to search VL databases (including VL images) in various applications, and so, clustering algorithms that scale well to VL data are important and useful. This paper compares the efficacy of three different implementations of techniques aimed to extend fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to VL data.

These algorithms map a set of feature vectors into a set of prototypes associated with a competitive network that performs unsupervised learning. Derivation of the new algorithms is accomplished by minimizing an average generalized distance between the feature vectors and prototypes using gradient descent. A close relationship between the resulting algorithms and fuzzy c-means is revealed by investigating the functionals involved. It is also shown that the fuzzy c-means and fuzzy learning vector quantization algorithms are related to the proposed algorithms if the learning rate at each iteration is selected to satisfy a certain condition.,Nicolaos B Karayiannis and James C Bezdek,190,1148233922177700070,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,4,622-628,IEEE,An integrated approach to fuzzy learning vector quantization and fuzzy c-means clustering,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/649915/,5,1997,/scholar?cites=1148233922177700070,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC

In the two decades since its birth, the field has undergone enormous growth; some four thousand papers, thirty books, four journals, and an international society bear witness.

First, the philosophical underpinnings of fuzzy reasoning are both plausible and intuitively satisfying; but they run counter to an inertial force of immense proportions—viz., several thousand years worth of mathematical structures built upon"" conventional"" set theory. There is an understandable reluctance on the part of many to reconsider or extend ideas which have been, in science, so demonstrably successful. Second, the promise of fuzzy sets—to improve models of physical processes, thereby improving prediction about and control of the processes themselves—has been kept, but the rate of improvement has been less dramatic than expected. Impatience for useful results is sometimes manifested by a sense of disappointment. And finally, there has been great nonuniformity in the quality and depth of published research in the various disciplines that have been studied. It is my belief that this last point is a significant one; and that it is both natural and understandable.

Given a pairwise dissimilarity matrix D of a set of n objects, visual methods such as the VAT algorithm generally represent D as an n × n image I(D̃) where the objects are reordered to reveal hidden cluster structure as dark blocks along the diagonal of the image. A major limitation of such methods is their inability to highlight cluster structure when D contains highly complex clusters.

Visual examination of the image of a reordered version of D provides an estimate for the number of clusters to seek in D. Then, clustering with single linkage or non-Euclidean relational fuzzy c-means produces groups of summaries. Subsequently, each group is represented by a linguistic medoid prototype. The prototypes can be used for resident monitoring, two types of anomaly detection, and interresident comparisons. We illustrate our model with real data for two residents collected at TigerPlace: the “aging in …",Anna Wilbik and James M Keller and James C Bezdek,34,5705061226887272648,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,1,110-123,IEEE,Linguistic prototypes for data from eldercare residents,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6471801/,22,2013,/scholar?cites=5705061226887272648,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:w0F2JDEymm0C
19157,"Relational fuzzy c-means (RFCM) is an algorithm for clustering objects represented in a pairwise dissimilarity values in a dissimilarity data matrix D. RFCM is dual to the fuzzy c-means (FCM) object data algorithm when D is a Euclidean matrix. When D is not Euclidean, RFCM can fail to execute if it encounters negative relational distances. To overcome this problem we can Euclideanize the relation D prior to clustering. There are different ways to Euclideanize D such as the β-spread transformation. In this article we compare five methods for Euclideanizing D to D˜. The quality of D˜ for our purpose is judged by the ability of RFCM to discover the apparent cluster structure of the objects underlying the data matrix D. The subdominant ultrametric transformation is a clear winner, producing much better partitions of D˜ than the other four methods. This leads to a new algorithm which we call the improved RFCM (iRFCM).",Mohammed A Khalilia and James Bezdek and Mihail Popescu and James M Keller,33,16518585347232246186,Pattern Recognition,12,3920-3930,Pergamon,Improvements to the relational fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003132031400243X,47,2014,/scholar?cites=16518585347232246186,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:-yGd096yOn8C
19158,"A key challenge in pattern recognition is how to scale the computational efficiency of clustering algorithms on large data sets. The extension of non‐Euclidean relational fuzzy c‐means (NERF) clustering to very large (VL = unloadable) relational data is called the extended NERF (eNERF) clustering algorithm, which comprises four phases: (i) finding distinguished features that monitor progressive sampling; (ii) progressively sampling from a N × N relational matrix RN to obtain a n × n sample matrix Rn; (iii) clustering Rn with literal NERF; and (iv) extending the clusters in Rn to the remainder of the relational data. Previously published examples on several fairly small data sets suggest that eNERF is feasible for truly large data sets.

Specifically we consider clustering-and-relabeling; Parzen's classifier; radial basis functions (RBF) networks; learning vector quantization (LVQ) type classifiers; and nearest neighbor rules. To classify an unlabeled point x the GNPC combines the degrees of similarity of x to a set of prototypes. Five questions are addressed for these GNPC families: (1) How many prototypes do we need? (2) How are the prototypes found? (3) How are their class labels obtained? (4) How are the similarities defined? (5) How are the similarities and label information combined? The classification performance of a set of GNPCs is illustrated on two benchmark data sets: IRIS and the 2-spirals data.

The superiority of NMIsM is most pronounced for datasets with overlapped and/or varying-sized clusters. Finally, we provide a …",Yang Lei and James C Bezdek and Jeffrey Chan and Nguyen Xuan Vinh and Simone Romano and James Bailey,25,12508284272209871934,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,4,1013-1018,IEEE,Extending information-theoretic validity indices for fuzzy clustering,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7499841/,25,2016,/scholar?cites=12508284272209871934,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:yTLRzDEmwhEC
19184,"We extend the nearest prototype classifier to a generalized nearest prototype classifier (GNPC). The GNPC uses ""soft"" labeling of the prototypes in the classes, thereby encompassing a variety of classifiers. Based on how the prototypes are found we distinguish between presupervised and post-supervised GNPC designs. We derive the conditions for optimality of two designs where prototypes represent: 1) the components of class-conditional mixture densities (presupervised design); or 2) the components of the unconditional mixture density (post-supervised design). An artificial data set and the ""satimage"" data set from the database ELENA are used to experimentally study the two approaches. A radial basis function network is used as a representative of each GNPC type. Neither the theoretical nor the experimental results indicate clear reasons to prefer one of the approaches. The post-supervised GNPC design …",Ludmila I Kuncheva and James C Bezdek,25,3854187346315786762,IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks,5,1142-1152,IEEE,Presupervised and post-supervised prototype classifier design,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/788653/,10,1999,/scholar?cites=3854187346315786762,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:D_sINldO8mEC

19186,"The intrinsic nature of streaming data requires algorithms that are capable of fast data analysis to extract knowledge. Most current unsupervised data analysis techniques rely on the implementation of known batch techniques over a sliding window, which can hinder their utility for the analysis of evolving structure in applications involving large streams of data. This research presents a novel data clustering algorithm, which exploits the correlation between data points in time to cluster the data, while maintaining a set of decision boundaries to identify noisy or anomalous data. We illustrate the proposed algorithm for online clustering with numerical results on both real-life and simulated datasets, which demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our approach compared to existing methods.",Masud Moshtaghi and Christopher Leckie and James C Bezdek,24,8358893586894184374,,,360-368,Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,Online clustering of multivariate time-series,https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611974348.41,,2016,/scholar?cites=8358893586894184374,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:3_LpOwP6eMYC
19187,"We discuss target detection in LADAR intensity images. Thirteen features, eleven of which come from an asymmetric co-occurrence matrix, are extracted from region-of-interest windows in each image. Two methods of feature selection are applied to the extracted vectors. Random selection leads to a pair of selected features for a nearest-neighbor rule (1-nn) detector. Extended backpropagation leads to six selected features using a modified multilayered perceptron (MLP) network. The 1-nn detector achieves a test-error rate of about 16% at a false-alarm rate of 8%. The MLP has a test-error rate of about 12% with a false-alarm rate of 6%.",Nikhil R Pal and Tobias C Cahoon and James C Bezdek and L Pal,24,14963642762968151178,IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems,1,44-52,IEEE,A new approach to target recognition for LADAR data,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/917113/,9,2001,/scholar?cites=14963642762968151178,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:pAkWuXOU-OoC
19188,"This paper discusses the relationship between the sequential hard c-means (SHCM), learning vector quantization (LVQ), and fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms. LVQ and SHCM suffer from several major problems. For example, they depend heavily on initialization. If the initial values of the cluster centers are outside the convex hull of the input data, such algorithms, even if they terminate, may not produce meaningful results in terms of prototypes for cluster representation. This is due in part to the fact that they update only the winning prototype for every input vector. We also discuss the impact and interaction of these two families with Kohonen's self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM), which is not a clustering method, but which often lends itself to clustering algorithms. Then we present two generalizations of LVQ that are explicitly designed as clustering algorithms: we refer to these algorithms as …",James C Bezdek,24,2842894073256282214,,,280-299,International Society for Optics and Photonics,Integration and generalization of LVQ and c-means clustering,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/1826/0000/Integration-and-generalization-of-LVQ-and-c-means-clustering-Invited/10.1117/12.131608.short,1826,1992,/scholar?cites=2842894073256282214,kXy4LAMAAAAJ:XiSMed-E-HIC

19191,"The C index is an internal cluster validity index that was introduced in 1970 as a way to define and identify a “best” crisp partition on n objects represented by either unlabeled feature vectors or dissimilarity matrix data. This index is often one of the better performers among the plethora of internal indices available for this task. This paper develops a soft generalization of the C index that can be used to evaluate sets of candidate partitions found by either fuzzy or probabilistic clustering algorithms. We define four generalizations based on relational transformations of the soft partition and, then, compare their performance to eight other popular internal fuzzy cluster indices using two methods of comparison (internal “best-c ” and internal/external (I/E) “best match”), six synthetic datasets, and six real-world labeled datasets.

19193,"This paper presents a new scheme for mapping high dimensional data onto two-dimensional viewing spaces. The mapping procedure is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is applied to the N-dimensional data to find membership functions of clusters in the data. Core subsets are then selected from the original data based upon threshold values applied to the membership functions found by FCM. In the second stage feature vectors in the selected “core” subsets are submitted to various feature extraction mappings, which yield scatterplots of the image points in 2D space. The proposed approach has two significant advantages over many previous schemes. First, changes in the core structure imposed on the original data under feature extraction can be used to gauge the relative quality of competing extraction techniques.
