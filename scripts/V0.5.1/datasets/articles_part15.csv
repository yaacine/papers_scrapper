15008,"Improved jet energy scale corrections, based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse-femtobarns collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, are presented. The corrections as a function of pseudorapidity eta and transverse momentum pT are extracted from data and simulated events combining several channels and methods. They account successively for the effects of pileup, uniformity of the detector response, and residual data-simulation jet energy scale differences. Further corrections, depending on the jet flavor and distance parameter (jet size) R, are also presented. The jet energy resolution is measured in data and simulated events and is studied as a function of pileup, jet size, and jet flavor. Typical jet energy resolutions at the central rapidities are 15-20% at 30 GeV, about 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV. The studies exploit events with dijet topology, as well as photon+ jet, Z+ jet and multijet events. Several new techniques are used to account for the various sources of jet energy scale corrections, and a full set of uncertainties, and their correlations, are provided.

Heavy-flavour jet identification techniques exploit the properties of the hadrons in the jet to discriminate between jets originating from b or c quarks (heavy-flavour jets) and those originating from light-flavour quarks or gluons (light-flavour jets). The CMS Collaboration presented in ref.[1] a set of b jet identification techniques used in physics analyses performed on LHC Run 1 pp collision data, collected in 2011 and 2012 at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV.

15055,"This paper reports an updated measurement of the standard model CP violation parameter sin 2 β using the CDF Detector at Fermilab. The entire run I data sample of 110 pb− 1 of proton-antiproton collisions at s= 1.8 TeV is used to identify a signal sample of∼ 400 B→ J/ψ K S 0 events, where J/ψ→ μ+ μ− and K S 0→ π+ π−. The flavor of the neutral B meson is identified at the time of production by combining information from three tagging algorithms: a same-side tag, a jet-charge tag, and a soft-lepton tag. A maximum likelihood fitting method is used to determine sin 2 β= 0.79− 0.44+ 0.41 (stat+ syst).

15059,"Real-space grids are a powerful alternative for the simulation of electronic systems. One of the main advantages of the approach is the flexibility and simplicity of working directly in real space where the different fields are discretized on a grid, combined with competitive numerical performance and great potential for parallelization. These properties constitute a great advantage at the time of implementing and testing new physical models. Based on our experience with the Octopus code, in this article we discuss how the real-space approach has allowed for the recent development of new ideas for the simulation of electronic systems.

The R AA in the 5% most central collisions shows a maximal suppression by a factor of 7-8 in the p T region of 6-9 GeV.

15068,"At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at root s = 7TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb(-1). The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events.

15080,"A statistical combination of searches is presented for massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, and ZH boson pairs in proton–proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data were taken at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to respective integrated luminosities of 19.7 and up to 2.7 fb− 1. The results are interpreted in the context of heavy vector triplet and singlet models that mimic properties of composite-Higgs models predicting W′ and Z′ bosons decaying to WZ, WW, WH, and ZH bosons.

15081,"Overall excess of fat, usually defined by the body mass index, is associated with metabolic (e.g. glucose intolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia) and non-metabolic disorders (e.g. neoplasias, polycystic ovary syndrome, non-alcoholic fat liver disease, glomerulopathy, bone fragility etc.). However, more than its total amount, the distribution of adipose tissue throughout the body is a better predictor of the risk to the development of those disorders. Fat accumulation in the abdominal area and in non-adipose tissue (ectopic fat), for example, is associated with increased risk to develop metabolic and non-metabolic derangements. On the other hand, observations suggest that individuals who present peripheral adiposity, characterized by large hip and thigh circumferences, have better glucose tolerance, reduced incidence of T2DM and of metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the main culprits in the association between obesity, particularly visceral, and metabolic as well as non-metabolic diseases. In this review we will highlight the current pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms possibly involved in the link between increased VAT, ectopic fat, IR and comorbidities. We will also provide some insights in the identification of these abnormalities.

15084,"An inclusive search for supersymmetry in events with at least one b-tagged jet is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment in 2012 at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data set size corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 inverse femtobarns. The two-dimensional distribution of the razor variables R^ 2 and M [R] is studied in events with and without leptons. The data are found to be consistent with the expected background, which is modeled with an empirical function. Exclusion limits on supersymmetric particle masses at a 95% confidence level are derived in several simplified supersymmetric scenarios for several choices of the branching fractions. By combining the likelihoods of a search in events without leptons and a search that requires a single lepton (electron or muon), an improved bound on the top-squark mass is obtained. Assuming the lightest supersymmetric particle to be stable and weakly interacting, and to have a mass of 100 GeV, the branching-fraction-dependent (-independent) production of gluinos is excluded for gluino masses up to 1310 (1175) GeV.

These new results provide additional constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton in the range of the Bjorken scaling variable x from 10−3 to 10−1. These measurements and the recent CMS measurement of associated W+charm production are used together with the cross sections for inclusive deep inelastic e±p scattering at HERA in a next-to-leading-order QCD analysis.

15133,"Combined measurements of the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson, as well as its couplings to vector bosons and fermions, are presented. The analysis uses the LHC proton-proton collision data set recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb . The combination is based on analyses targeting the five main Higgs boson production mechanisms (gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production with a W or Z boson, or a top quark-antiquark pair) and the following decay modes: H , ZZ, WW, , bb, and . Searches for invisible Higgs boson decays are also considered. The best-fit ratio of the signal yield to the standard model expectation is measured to be 1.170.10, assuming a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV. Additional results are given for parametrizations with varying assumptions on the scaling behavior of the different production and decay modes, including generic ones based on ratios of cross sections and branching fractions or coupling modifiers. The results are compatible with the standard model predictions in all parametrizations considered.

Using a data sample of 310 pb− 1 collected by the Run II Collider Detector at Fermilab at s= 1.96 TeV, exclusive cross sections for events with two jets of transverse energy E T jet≥ 10 GeV have been measured as a function of minimum E T jet.

15138,The cross section for the production of single top quarks in the t channel is measured in proton–proton collisions at 13 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The analyzed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 fb− 1. The event selection requires one muon and two jets where one of the jets is identified as originating from a bottom quark. Several kinematic variables are then combined into a multivariate discriminator to distinguish signal from background events. A fit to the distribution of the discriminating variable yields a total cross section of 238±13 (stat)±29 (syst) pb and a ratio of top quark and top antiquark production of R t-ch.= 1.81±0.18 (stat)±0.15 (syst). From the total cross section the absolute value of the CKM matrix element V t b is calculated to be 1.05±0.07 (exp)±0.02 (theo).

15177,"The production of J/ψ and ψ (2S) was studied with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The measurement was performed at forward rapidity (2.5< y< 4) down to zero transverse momentum (p t) in the dimuon decay channel. Inclusive J/ψ yields were extracted in different centrality classes and the centrality dependence of the average p t is presented. The J/ψ suppression, quantified with the nuclear modification factor (R AA), was measured as a function of centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity. Comparisons with similar measurements at lower collision energy and theoretical models indicate that the J/ψ production is the result of an interplay between color screening and recombination mechanisms in a deconfined partonic medium, or at its hadronization.

Sinus rhythm was restored in 35%, 4%, and 4% of patients, respectively (P<0·001, dofetilide vs placebo;P=ns, amiodarone versus placebo). Dofetilide was more effective in atrial flutter than in atrial fibrillation (cardioversion rates 75% and 22%, respectively;P=0·004). The mean time to conversion with dofetilide was 55±15min. Dofetilide prolonged the QTc interval (+16% at 20min).

For that purpose, we calculated the static polarizabilities, ionization potentials, and optical absorption spectrum of four small clusters, Na2, Na4, SiH4, and Si2H6, using a real-space, real-time technique. The computed static polarizabilities and ionization potentials seem to be in rather good agreement with the available experimental data, once the proper asymptotics of the potential are taken into account. The same conclusion holds for the absorption spectra, although the xc kernels in use do not provide a sufficiently strong attractive interaction between electrons and holes, leading to spectra slightly shifted towards higher energies.

The combined measurement yields R b= 0.229±0.011 and is consistent with standard model predictions.© 1996 The American Physical Society.,K Abe and I Abt and CJ Ahn and T Akagi and NJ Allen and WW Ash and D Aston and KG Baird and C Baltay and HR Band and MB Barakat and G Baranko and O Bardon and T Barklow and AO Bazarko and R Ben-David and AC Benvenuti and T Bienz and GM Bilei and D Bisello and G Blaylock and JR Bogart and T Bolton and GR Bower and JE Brau and M Breidenbach and WM Bugg and D Burke and TH Burnett and PN Burrows and W Busza and A Calcaterra and DO Caldwell and D Calloway and B Camanzi and M Carpinelli and R Cassell and R Castaldi and A Castro and M Cavalli-Sforza and E Church and HO Cohn and JA Coller and V Cook and R Cotton and RF Cowan and DG Coyne and A D’Oliveira and CJS Damerell and M Daoudi and R De Sangro and P De Simone and R Dell’Orso and M Dima and PYC Du and R Dubois and BI Eisenstein and R Elia and E Etzion and D Falciai and MJ Fero and R Frey and K Furuno and T Gillman and G Gladding and S Gonzalez and GD Hallewell and EL Hart and Y Hasegawa and S Hedges and SS Hertzbach and MD Hildreth and J Huber and ME Huffer and EW Hughes and H Hwang and Y Iwasaki and DJ Jackson and P Jacques and J Jaros and AS Johnson and JR Johnson and RA Johnson and T Junk and R Kajikawa and M Kalelkar and HJ Kang and I Karliner and H Kawahara and HW Kendall and Y Kim and ME King and R King and RR Kofler and NM Krishna and RS Kroeger and M Langston and Amitabh Lath and JA Lauber and DWG Leith and MX Liu and X Liu and M Loreti and A Lu and HL Lynch and J Ma and G Mancinelli and S Manly and G Mantovani and TW Markiewicz and T Maruyama and R Massetti and H Masuda and E Mazzucato and AK McKemey and BT Meadows and R Messner and PM Mockett and KC Moffeit and B Mours and G Müller and M Nussbaum and Y Ohnishi and LS Osborne and RS Panvini and H Park and TJ Pavel and I Peruzzi and M Piccolo and L Piemontese and E Pieroni and KT Pitts and RJ Plano and R Prepost and CY Prescott and GD Punkar and J Quigley and BN Ratcliff and TW Reeves and J Reidy and PE Rensing and LS Rochester and JE Rothberg and PC Rowson and JJ Russell and OH Saxton and SF Schaffner and T Schalk and RH Schindler and U Schneekloth,136,366258835479806695,Physical Review D,3,1023,American Physical Society,Measurements of  with impact parameters and displaced vertices,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.53.1023,53,1996,/scholar?cites=366258835479806695,wa656rsAAAAJ:NBmyyahqHj0C

Using the anti-k T algorithm, jets have been reconstructed in the central rapidity region from charged particles with resolution parameters R= 0.2 and R= 0.4. The reconstructed jets have been corrected for detector effects and the underlying event background. To calculate the nuclear modification factor, R pPb, of charged jets in p–Pb collisions, a pp reference was constructed by scaling previously measured charged jet spectra at s= 7 TeV.

15221,"A search for direct production of top squark pairs in events with jets and large transverse momentum imbalance is presented. The data are based on proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at the CERN LHC, and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1. The search considers a variety of R-parity conserving supersymmetric models, including ones for which the top squark and neutralino masses are nearly degenerate.

Pttg-null mice do not develop tumors, but exhibit pituitary hypoplasia, whereas mice heterozygous for the retinoblastoma (Rb) deletion develop pituitary tumors with high penetrance. Pttg-null mice were therefore cross-bred with Rb+/− mice to test the impact of pituitary hypoplasia on tumor development. Before tumor development, Rb+/−Pttg−/− mice have smaller pituitary glands with fewer cycling pituitary cells and exhibit induction of pituitary p21 levels.

15238,"The production of jets associated to bottom quarks is measured for the first time in PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. Jet spectra are reported in the transverse momentum (p T) range of 80–250 GeV/c, and within pseudorapidity| η|< 2. The nuclear modification factor (R AA) calculated from these spectra shows a strong suppression in the b-jet yield in PbPb collisions relative to the yield observed in p p collisions at the same energy. The suppression persists to the largest values of p T studied, and is centrality dependent. The R AA is about 0.4 in the most central events, similar to previous observations for inclusive jets. This implies that jet quenching does not have a strong dependence on parton mass and flavor in the jet p T range studied.",Serguei Chatrchyan and Vardan Khachatryan and Albert M Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and Wolfgang Adam and Thomas Bergauer and Marko Dragicevic and Janos Erö and Christian Fabjan and Markus Friedl and Rudolf Fruehwirth and Vasile Mihai Ghete and Christian Hartl and Natascha Hörmann and Josef Hrubec and Manfred Jeitler and Wolfgang Kiesenhofer and Valentin Knünz and Manfred Krammer and Ilse Krätschmer and Dietrich Liko and Ivan Mikulec and Dinyar Rabady and Babak Rahbaran and Herbert Rohringer and Robert Schöfbeck and Josef Strauss and Anton Taurok and Wolfgang Treberer-Treberspurg and Wolfgang Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and Vladimir Mossolov and Nikolai Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and Sara Alderweireldt and Monika Bansal and Sunil Bansal and Tom Cornelis and Eddi A De Wolf and Xavier Janssen and Albert Knutsson and Sten Luyckx and Luca Mucibello and Silvia Ochesanu and Benoit Roland and Romain Rougny and Hans Van Haevermaet and Pierre Van Mechelen and Nick Van Remortel and Alex Van Spilbeeck and Freya Blekman and Stijn Blyweert and Jorgen D’Hondt and Natalie Heracleous and Alexis Kalogeropoulos and James Keaveney and Tae Jeong Kim and Steven Lowette and Michael Maes and Annik Olbrechts and Derek Strom and Stefaan Tavernier and Walter Van Doninck and Petra Van Mulders and Gerrit Patrick Van Onsem and Ilaria Villella and Cécile Caillol and Barbara Clerbaux and Gilles De Lentdecker and Laurent Favart and APR Gay and Alexandre Léonard and Pierre Edouard Marage and Abdollah Mohammadi and Luca Perniè and Thomas Reis and Tomislav Seva and Laurent Thomas and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and J Wang and Volker Adler and Kelly Beernaert and Leonardo Benucci and Anna Cimmino and Silvia Costantini and Sven Dildick and Guillaume Garcia and Benjamin Klein and Jeremie Lellouch and Joseph McCartin and AA Ocampo Rios and Dirk Ryckbosch and S Salva Diblen and Michael Sigamani and Nadja Strobbe and Filip Thyssen and Michael Tytgat and S Walsh and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and S Basegmez and C Beluffi and G Bruno and R Castello and A Caudron and L Ceard and GG Da Silveira and C Delaere and T Du Pree and D Favart and L Forthomme and A Giammanco and J Hollar and P Jez and M Komm and V Lemaitre and J Liao and O Militaru and C Nuttens and D Pagano and A Pin and K Piotrzkowski and A Popov and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and JM Vizan Garcia and N Beliy and T Caebergs and E Daubie and GH Hammad and GA Alves and M Correa Martins Junior and T Martins and ME Pol and MHG Souza and WL Aldá Júnior and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custodio and EM Da Costa and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and H Malbouisson and M Malek and D Matos Figueiredo and L Mundim and H Nogima,128,7765674516997692416,Physical review letters,13,132301,American Physical Society,Evidence of -Jet Quenching in PbPb Collisions at ,https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.132301,113,2014,/scholar?cites=7765674516997692416,wa656rsAAAAJ:ifIdVpG6JtcC

Alternatively, one can handle the electron−ion dynamics within the Ehrenfest scheme where no explicit orthogonalization is necessary, however the time step is too small for practical applications. Here we preserve the desirable properties of Ehrenfest in a new scheme that allows for a considerable increase of the time step while keeping the system close to the Born−Oppenheimer surface.

15264,"A search for heavy resonances decaying to a Higgs boson and a vector boson is presented. The analysis is performed using data samples collected in 2015 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 2.2–2.5 fb− 1. The search is performed in channels in which the vector boson decays into leptonic final states (Z→ ν ν, W→ ℓ ν, and Z→ ℓ ℓ, with ℓ= e, μ), while the Higgs boson decays to collimated b quark pairs detected as a single massive jet. The discriminating power of a jet mass requirement and ab jet tagging algorithm are exploited to suppress the standard model backgrounds.

15266,A numerical approach that allows for the solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) describing molecules exposed to intense short laser pulses was developed. The molecular response to the strong field is described within the single-active electron approximation (SAE). The method is applied in the fixed-nuclei approximation to molecular hydrogen with parallel orientation of the internuclear axis to the laser field. The validity of the SAE is investigated by comparing the ionization and electronic excitation yields to full two-electron solutions of the TDSE.

15320,"An inclusive search is performed for supersymmetry in final states containing jets and an apparent imbalance in transverse momentum, p→ T miss, due to the production of unobserved weakly interacting particles in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV.

15328,"A search for dark matter is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson decaying either to a pair of bottom quarks or to a pair of photons. The data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected in 2015 with the CMS detector at the LHC, correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Results are interpreted in the context of a Z'-two-Higgs-doublet model, where the gauge symmetry of the standard model is extended to a U (1)[Z'] group, with a new massive Z'gauge boson, and the Higgs sector is extended with four additional Higgs bosons. In this model, a high-mass resonance Z'decays into a pseudoscalar boson A and a light SM-like Higgs boson, and the A decays to a pair of dark matter particles. No significant excesses are observed over the background prediction. Combining results from the two decay channels yields exclusion limits in the signal cross section in the m [Z']-m [A] phase space.

15365,"An extensive study of the optical absorption spectra of the blue fluorescent protein (BFP) is presented. We investigate different protonation states of the chromophore (neutral, anionic, and cationic) and analyze the role of the protein environment and of thermal fluctuations. The role of the environment is 2-fold:  (i) it induces structural modifications of the gas-phase chromophore, the most important being the torsion of the imida rings; and (ii) it makes a local-field modification of the external electromagnetic field. It turns out that the torsion of the imida rings shifts significantly the gas-phase spectra to lower energies, whereas the consistent inclusion of the closest residues field produces only minor modifications on the spectra. From all of the configurations studied, the neutral cis-HSD and the anionic HSA seem to be the most likely candidates to explain the experimental spectrum.

The free energies of adsorption of the neutral molecules were obtained using a simple Langmuir model.

An alkyl chain of at least five carbons was found to be necessary to balance the bulk ionic solvation and thereby bring the ion interface population to a level above the water background.

Events with at least one pair of jets are denoted as “inclusive”. Events with exactly one pair of jets are called “exclusive”. The ratio of the cross section of all pairwise combinations of jets to the exclusive dijet cross section as a function of the rapidity difference between jets| Δy| is measured for the first time up to| Δy|= 9.2. The ratio of the cross section for the pair consisting of the most forward and the most backward jet from the inclusive sample to the exclusive dijet cross section is also presented. The predictions of the Monte Carlo event generators pythia 6 and pythia 8 agree with the measurements. In both ratios the herwig++ generator exhibits a more pronounced rise versus| Δy| than observed in the data.

Three-dimensional sizes of the system (femtoscopic radii), as well as direction-averaged one-dimensional radii are extracted. The radii decrease with k T, following a power-law behavior. This is qualitatively consistent with expectations from a collectively expanding system, produced in hydrodynamic calculations. The radii also scale linearly with〈 d N ch/d η〉 1/3. This behavior is compared to world data on femtoscopic radii in heavy-ion collisions.

Observables that can be computed and compared in the two descriptions include Rényi and entanglement entropies, and correlation functions of local operators. We develop techniques for computing these, in a manner that sheds light on when and why one can expect agreement between such quantities on each side of the duality. We set up the computation of excited state Rényi entropies in the bulk in terms of Chern-Simons connections, and show how this directly parallels the CFT computation of correlation functions.

We show herein how these techniques can be easily extended to study time‐resolved pump–probe experiments, in which a system response (absorption or electron emission) to a probe pulse is measured in an excited state. This simulation tool helps with the interpretation of fast‐evolving attosecond time‐resolved spectroscopic experiments, in which electronic motion must be followed at its natural timescale. We show how the extra degrees of freedom (pump‐pulse duration, intensity, frequency, and time delay), which are absent in a conventional steady‐state experiment, provide additional information about electronic structure and dynamics that improve characterization of a system.

15425,"The production of charged pions, kaons and (anti) protons has been measured at mid-rapidity (− 0.5< y< 0) in p–Pb collisions at s NN= 5.02 TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. Exploiting particle identification capabilities at high transverse momentum (p T), the previously published p T spectra have been extended to include measurements up to 20 GeV/c for seven event multiplicity classes. The p T spectra for pp collisions at s= 7 TeV, needed to interpolate a pp reference spectrum, have also been extended up to 20 GeV/c to measure the nuclear modification factor (R pPb) in non-single diffractive p–Pb collisions.

15453,"We measured visual performance in achromatic and chromatic spatial tasks of mercury-exposed subjects and compared the results with norms obtained from healthy individuals of similar age. Data were obtained for a group of 28 mercury-exposed subjects, comprising 20 Amazonian gold miners, 2 inhabitants of Amazonian riverside communities, and 6 laboratory technicians, who asked for medical care. Statistical norms were generated by testing healthy control subjects divided into three age groups. The performance of a substantial proportion of the mercury-exposed subjects was below the norms in all of these tasks. Eleven of 20 subjects (55%) performed below the norms in the achromatic contrast sensitivity task. The mercury-exposed subjects also had lower red-green contrast sensitivity deficits at all tested spatial frequencies (9/11 subjects; 81%). Three gold miners and 1 riverine (4/19 subjects, 21%) performed worse than normal subjects making more mistakes in the color arrangement test. Five of 10 subjects tested (50%), comprising 2 gold miners, 2 technicians, and 1 riverine, performed worse than normal in the color discrimination test, having areas of one or more MacAdam ellipse larger than normal subjects and high color discrimination thresholds at least in one color locus.

We are interested in mapping determinants of QR, and pyramiding resistance alleles at QTL loci may lead to durable resistance as well as provide independent validation of QTL effects and estimation of QTL interactions.

The J/ψ mesons are reconstructed at midrapidity (| y|< 0.9) in the dielectron decay channel and at forward rapidity (2.5< y< 4.0) in the dimuon channel, both down to zero transverse momentum. At forward rapidity, the elliptic flow v 2 of the J/ψ is studied as a function of the transverse momentum and centrality. A positive v 2 is observed in the transverse momentum range 2< p T< 8 GeV/c in the three centrality classes studied and confirms with higher statistics our earlier results at s N N= 2.76 TeV in semicentral collisions.

15500,"Measurements of strange hadron (K S 0, Λ+ Λ‾, and Ξ−+ Ξ‾+) transverse momentum spectra in p p, p Pb, and PbPb collisions are presented over a wide range of rapidity and event charged-particle multiplicity.

15509,"In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, the event-by-event variation of the elliptic flow v 2 reflects fluctuations in the shape of the initial state of the system. This allows to select events with the same centrality but different initial geometry. This selection technique, Event Shape Engineering, has been used in the analysis of charge-dependent two-and three-particle correlations in Pb–Pb collisions at s NN= 2.76 TeV.

15522,"Combined results are reported from searches for the standard model Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 7 TeV in five Higgs boson decay modes: gamma pair, b-quark pair, tau lepton pair, W pair, and Z pair. The explored Higgs boson mass range is 110-600 GeV. The analysed data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6-4.8 inverse femtobarns. The expected excluded mass range in the absence of the standard model Higgs boson is 118-543 GeV at 95% CL. The observed results exclude the standard model Higgs boson in the mass range 127-600 GeV at 95% CL, and in the mass range 129-525 GeV at 99% CL. An excess of events above the expected standard model background is observed at the low end of the explored mass range making the observed limits weaker than expected in the absence of a signal. The largest excess, with a local significance of 3.1 sigma, is observed for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of 124 GeV. The global significance of observing an excess with a local significance greater than 3.1 sigma anywhere in the search range 110-600 (110-145) GeV is estimated to be 1.5 sigma (2.1 sigma).

15523,"Xenopus RINGO/Speedy (XRINGO) is a potent inducer of oocyte meiotic maturation that can directly activate Cdk1 and Cdk2. Here, we show that endogenous XRINGO protein accumulates transiently during meiosis I entry and then is downregulated. This tight regulation of XRINGO expression is the consequence of two interconnected mechanisms: processing and degradation. XRINGO processing involves recognition of at least three distinct phosphorylated recognition motifs by the SCF βTrCP ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasome-mediated limited degradation, resulting in an amino-terminal XRINGO fragment. XRINGO processing is directly stimulated by several kinases, including protein kinase A and glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and may contribute to the maintenance of G2 arrest. On the other hand, XRINGO degradation after meiosis I is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Siah-2, which probably requires …",Gustavo J Gutierrez and Andrea Vögtlin and Ana Castro and Ingvar Ferby and Giorgia Salvagiotto and Ze'ev Ronai and Thierry Lorca and Angel R Nebreda,57,7239728018688452215,Nature cell biology,10,1084-1094,Nature Publishing Group,Meiotic regulation of the CDK activator RINGO/Speedy by ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated processing and degradation,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb1472,8,2006,/scholar?cites=7239728018688452215,wa656rsAAAAJ:WgBxaE7EUScC

15529,"We report linear response properties of the recently proposed boron fullerenes [N. Gonzalez Szwacki et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 98, 166804]: magnetic susceptibilities, static dipole polarizabilities and dynamical polarizabilities (i.e. optical and near ultraviolet absorption spectra), calculated from first principles within the (time-dependent) density-functional theory framework. We find that all clusters except B80 are diamagnetic. The strong cancellation between diamagnetic and paramagnetic currents in B80 leads to a very small value for its susceptibility that turns out to be slightly paramagnetic.

Events are selected with one isolated muon or electron and at least four jets from data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb . For each event the mass is reconstructed from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a  hypothesis. Using the ideogram method, the top quark mass is determined simultaneously with an overall jet energy scale factor (JSF), constrained by the mass of the W boson in  decays. The measurement is calibrated on samples simulated at next-to-leading order matched to a leading-order parton shower. The top quark mass is found to be 172.250.08 (stat+ JSF) 0.62 (syst) GeV.

15541,"Human type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is often characterized by obesity-associated insulin resistance (IR) and β-cell function deficiency. Development of relevant large animal models to study T2DM is important and timely, because most existing models have dramatic reductions in pancreatic function and no associated obesity and IR, features that resemble more T1DM than T2DM. Our goal was to create a canine model of T2DM in which obesity-associated IR occurs first, followed by moderate reduction in β-cell function, leading to mild diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Lean dogs (n = 12) received a high-fat diet that increased visceral (52%, P < 0.001) and subcutaneous (130%, P < 0.001) fat and resulted in a 31% reduction in insulin sensitivity (SI) (5.8 ± 0.7 × 10−4 to 4.1 ± 0.5 × 10−4 μU·ml−1·min−1, P < 0.05).

We measure this polarization from the invariant mass of the b quark from t→ W b and the lepton from W→ l ν whose momenta measure the W decay angle and direction of motion, respectively. In this paper we present a measurement of the decay rate (f V+ A) of the W produced from the decay of the top quark in the hypothesis of V+ A structure of the t W b vertex.

The momentum ratio of the two leading partons, resolved as subjets, provides information about the parton shower evolution. This substructure observable, known as the splitting function, reflects the process of a parton splitting into two other partons and has been measured for jets with transverse momentum between 140 and 500 GeV, in p p and PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair.

15586,"Results are presented from a search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in pp collisions in final states with two tau leptons. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity between 18.1 inverse femtobarns and 19.6 inverse femtobarns depending on the final state of tau lepton decays, at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The observed event yields in the signal regions are consistent with the expected standard model backgrounds. The results are interpreted using simplified models describing the pair production and decays of charginos or tau sleptons. For models describing the pair production of the lightest chargino, exclusion limits are obtained in the plane of chargino mass vs. neutralino mass under the following assumptions: the chargino decays into third-generation sleptons, which are taken as the lightest sleptons, and the slepton masses lie midway between those of the chargino and the neutralino. Chargino masses below 420 GeV are excluded at a 95% confidence level in the limit of a massless neutralino, and for neutralino masses up to 100 GeV, chargino masses up to 325 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. Constraints are also placed on the cross section for pair production of tau sleptons as a function of mass, assuming a massless neutralino.",CMS collaboration,48,8843433040794338584,arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.04870,,,,Search for electroweak production of charginos in final states with two tau leptons in pp collisions at sqrt (s)= 8 TeV,https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04870,,2016,/scholar?cites=8843433040794338584,wa656rsAAAAJ:kWvqk_afx_IC

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt (s)= 13 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2015. Two jets are required in each event, providing good sensitivity to strong production of gluinos and squarks. The search regions, sensitive to a range of different supersymmetry scenarios, are defined using the number of jets tagged as originating from bottom quarks, the sum of the magnitudes of the transverse momenta of the jets, the imbalance in the overall transverse momentum in the event, and the invariant mass of opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pairs. The event yields observed in data are consistent with the expected background contributions from standard model processes.

This search is based on 1.9 fb− 1 of data collected using the CDF detector during Run II of the Tevatron at Fermilab. We study t t¯ events in the lepton+ jets channel with at least one b-tagged jet. A massive gluon is characterized by its mass, decay width, and the strength of its coupling to quarks. These parameters are determined according to the observed invariant mass distribution of top quark pairs. We set limits on the massive gluon coupling strength for masses between 400 and 800 GeV/c 2 and width-to-mass ratios between 0.05 and 0.50.

15655,"Three of the most significant measured deviations from standard model predictions, the enhanced decay rate for B→ D (*) τ ν, hints of lepton universality violation in B→ K (*) ℓ ℓ decays, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, can be explained by the existence of leptoquarks (LQs) with large couplings to third-generation quarks and masses at the TeV scale. The existence of these states can be probed at the LHC in high energy proton-proton collisions.

15665,"A search for supersymmetry in hadronic final states with highly boosted W bosons and b jets is presented, focusing on compressed scenarios. The search is performed using proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. Events containing candidates for hadronic decays of boosted W bosons are identified using jet substructure techniques, and are analyzed using the razor variables M [R] and R^ 2, which characterize a possible signal as a peak on a smoothly falling background. The observed event yields in the signal regions are found to be consistent with the expected contributions from standard model processes, which are predicted using control samples in the data. The results are interpreted in terms of gluino-pair production followed by their exclusive decay into top squarks and top quarks.

15677,We study rotating black holes in five dimensions using the nAdS 2/nCFT 1 correspondence. A consistent truncation of pure Einstein gravity (with a cosmological constant) in five dimensions to two dimensions gives a generalization of the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory that has two scalar fields: a dilaton and a squashing parameter that breaks spherical symmetry. The interplay between these two scalar fields is non trivial and leads to interesting new features. We study the holographic description of this theory and apply the results to the thermodynamics of the rotating black hole from a two dimensional point of view. This setup challenges notions of universality that have been advanced based on simpler models: we find that the mass gap of Kerr-AdS 5 corresponds to an undetermined effective coupling in the nAdS 2/nCFT 1 theory which depends on ultraviolet data.,Alejandra Castro and Finn Larsen and Ioannis Papadimitriou,40,12188407369227844363,Journal of High Energy Physics,10,42,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,5D rotating black holes and the nAdS2/nCFT1 correspondence,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP10(2018)042,2018,2018,/scholar?cites=12188407369227844363,wa656rsAAAAJ:PRLG7g5oK-wC

15684,"Aims:  The primary goal of this study was to characterize the existence of a functional c‐di‐GMP pathway in the bioleaching bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.Methods and Results:  A bioinformatic search revealed that the genome sequence of At. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 codes for several proteins involved in the c‐di‐GMP pathway, including diguanylate cyclases (DGC), phosphodiesterases and PilZ effector proteins. Overexpression in Escherichia coli demonstrated that four At. ferrooxidans genes code for proteins containing GGDEF/EAL domains with functional DGC activity. MS/MS analysis allowed the identification of c‐di‐GMP in nucleotide preparations obtained from At. ferrooxidans cells. In addition, c‐di‐GMP levels in cells grown on the surface of solid energetic substrates such as sulfur prills or pyrite were higher than those measured in ferrous iron planktonic cells.Conclusions:  At …",LM Ruiz and M Castro and A Barriga and CA Jerez and N Guiliani,40,2625048811020388734,Letters in applied microbiology,2,133-139,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,The extremophile Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans possesses a c‐di‐GMP signalling pathway that could play a significant role during bioleaching of minerals,https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2011.03180.x,54,2012,/scholar?cites=2625048811020388734,wa656rsAAAAJ:LpWf3qrnWeoC

15700,"A search for anomalous electroweak production of WW, WZ, and ZZ boson pairs in association with two jets in proton-proton collisions at s= 13 TeV at the LHC is reported. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb− 1 collected with the CMS detector. Events are selected by requiring two jets with large rapidity separation and invariant mass, one or two leptons (electrons or muons), and a W or Z boson decaying hadronically.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of such measurements in p p collisions at ultrarelativistic energies. The femtoscopy method is employed to constrain the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions, which are still rather poorly understood. A new method to evaluate the influence of residual correlations induced by the decays of resonances and experimental impurities is hereby presented.

For samples at 2% until 2 h the swelling ability, G′ and η* values increased with the cross-linking degree, because the longer polymer chains became progressively more entangled and linked.

The calculations are based on a mixed quantum-classical description: The electrons are treated quantum mechanically (making use of time-dependent density-functional theory), whereas the nuclei are treated classically. The temporal shape of the pulses is tailored to maximize a control target functional which is designed to produce the desired molecular cleavage. The precise definition of this functional is a crucial ingredient: we explore expressions based on the forces, on the momenta and on the velocities of the nuclei. The algorithm used to find the optimum pulse is also relevant; we test both direct gradient-free algorithms, as well as schemes based on formal optimal control theory.

15723,"By first-principles time-dependent density-functional calculations, we show the relevance of relativistic effects to shape the photoabsorption cross section of small gold clusters (Aun, n⩽8, and n=20) and small nanowires (n⩽7). The relativistic effects not only dictate the stabilization of planar geometries (as it has already been shown by treating the core electrons relativistically): The spin-orbit coupling also has a strong impact in the absorption spectra (resonances and oscillator strengths). This is especially true for nanowires, where the effect of spin orbit is large and not substantially reduced with the chain length, in contrast to more compact gold clusters where this spin-orbit effect tends to be quenched. These results have far reaching consequences in fields such as electronic transport, where gold nanowires are often used, but where spin-orbit effects are generally disregarded.",Alberto Castro and Miguel AL Marques and Aldo H Romero and Micael JT Oliveira and Angel Rubio,37,4249865818471266315,The Journal of chemical physics,14,144110,American Institute of Physics,The role of dimensionality on the quenching of spin-orbit effects in the optics of gold nanostructures,https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2990745,129,2008,/scholar?cites=4249865818471266315,wa656rsAAAAJ:3Jzcn9274UAC

Contrary to the time-dependent Schrödinger’s equation, this set of equations is nonlinear, due to the dependence of the Hamiltonian on the electronic density. We discuss some of their exact properties, and in particular their symplectic structure. Four different families of propagators are considered, specifically the linear multistep, Runge–Kutta, exponential Runge–Kutta, and the commutator-free Magnus schemes. These have been chosen because they have been largely ignored in the past for time-dependent electronic structure calculations. The performance is analyzed in terms of cost-versus-accuracy.

The broad pseudorapidity range (− 3.5< η< 5) allows precise estimates of the total number of produced charged particles which we find to range from 162±22 (syst.) to 17170±770 (syst.) in 80–90% and 0–5% central collisions, respectively.

Then, the existence of a well-defined Poisson bracket allows us to arrive to a Liouville equation for a statistical ensemble of Ehrenfest systems.

For that purpose, we have overlayed a direct-optimization scheme on top of a fully unconstrained computation of the three-dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation. The procedure looks for pulses that maintain the same total length and integrated intensity or fluence as a given pulse that serves as an initial guess. It allows, however, for changes in frequencies—within a certain, predefined range—and overall shape, leading to enhanced ionization. We illustrate the scheme by calculating ionization yields for the H 2+ molecule when irradiated with short (≈ 5 fs), high-intensity laser pulses.

In this cross-sectional study, 100 Crohn’s disease (CD) patients and 100 ulcerative colitis (UC) subjects were assessed. Anemia workup included complete blood count, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum levels of folic acid and vitamin B12, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration. Results. The overall prevalence of anemia in IBD was 21%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of anemia between CD subjects (24%) and UC (18%). Moderate disease activity (OR: 3.48, 95% CI, 1.95–9.64, ) and elevated CRP levels (OR: 1.8, 95% CI, 1.04–3.11, ) were independently associated with anemia. The most common etiologies of anemia found in both groups were iron deficiency anemia (IDA; 10% on CD and 6% on UC) followed by the anemia of chronic disease (ACD; 6% for both groups). Conclusions. In Brazilian IBD outpatients, anemia is highly concurrent condition. Disease moderate activity as well as increased CRP was strongly associated with comorbid anemia. IDA and/or ACD were the most common etiologies.",Carla Valéria de Alvarenga Antunes and Abrahão Elias Hallack Neto and Cristiano Rodrigo de Alvarenga Nascimento and Liliana Andrade Chebli and Ivana Lúcia Damásio Moutinho and Bruno do Valle Pinheiro and Maycon Moura Reboredo and Carla Malaguti and Antonio Carlos Santana Castro and Júlio Maria Fonseca Chebli,34,17926814414216229949,BioMed Research International,,,Hindawi,"Anemia in inflammatory bowel disease outpatients: prevalence, risk factors, and etiology",https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/728925/abs/,2015,2015,/scholar?cites=17926814414216229949,wa656rsAAAAJ:vuU-T12QLgwC

Final states with photons and large missing transverse energy (E T miss) were examined. The data sample was collected in pp collisions at s= 8 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to 7.4 fb− 1. The analysis focuses on scenarios in which the lightest neutralino has bino-or wino-like components, resulting in decays to photons and gravitinos, where the gravitinos escape undetected. The data were obtained using a specially designed trigger with dedicated low thresholds, providing good sensitivity to signatures with photons, E T miss, and low hadronic energy.

15786,We present a measurement of b jet transverse momentum (p T) spectra in proton-lead (pPb) collisions using a dataset corresponding to about 35 nb− 1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Jets from b quark fragmentation are found by exploiting the long lifetime of hadrons containing ab quark through tagging methods using distributions of the secondary vertex mass and displacement. Extracted cross sections for b jets are scaled by the effective number of nucleon–nucleon collisions and are compared to a reference obtained from pythia simulations of pp collisions. The pythia-based estimate of the nuclear modification factor is found to be 1.22±0.15 (stat+ syst pPb)±0.27 (syst PYTHIA) averaged over all jets with p T between 55 and 400 GeV/c and with| η lab|< 2.

Taking into account that HF is related with changes in myocardial oxidative stress and in energy generation from metabolic pathways, it is important to clarify whether GH increase or decrease myocardial oxidative stress and what is its effect on energetic metabolism in HF condition. Thus, this study investigated the effects of two different doses of GH on energetic metabolism and oxidative stress in myocardium of rats with HF. Male Wistar rats (n = 25) were submitted to aortic stenosis (AS). The HF was evidenced by tachypnea and echocardiographic criteria around 28 weeks of AS.

In addition, the fraction of jets coming from charm quarks is found to be consistent with that predicted by pythia 6 for pp collisions at s= 2.76 and 5.02 TeV, and is independent of the jet transverse momentum from 55 to 400 GeV/c.",Albert M Sirunyan and Armen Tumasyan and Wolfgang Adam and E Asilar and Thomas Bergauer and Johannes Brandstetter and Erica Brondolin and Marko Dragicevic and Janos Erö and Martin Flechl and Markus Friedl and Rudolf Fruehwirth and Vasile Mihai Ghete and Christian Hartl and Natascha Hörmann and Josef Hrubec and Manfred Jeitler and Axel König and Ilse Krätschmer and Dietrich Liko and Takashi Matsushita and Ivan Mikulec and Dinyar Rabady and Navid Rad and Babak Rahbaran and Herbert Rohringer and Jochen Schieck and Josef Strauss and Wolfgang Waltenberger and C-E Wulz and Oleg Dvornikov and Vladimir Makarenko and Vladimir Zykunov and Vladimir Mossolov and Nikolai Shumeiko and J Suarez Gonzalez and Sara Alderweireldt and Eddi A De Wolf and Xavier Janssen and Jasper Lauwers and Merijn Van De Klundert and Hans Van Haevermaet and Pierre Van Mechelen and Nick Van Remortel and Alex Van Spilbeeck and S Abu Zeid and Freya Blekman and Jorgen D'Hondt and Nadir Daci and Isabelle De Bruyn and Kevin Deroover and Steven Lowette and Seth Moortgat and Lieselotte Moreels and Annik Olbrechts and Quentin Python and Stefaan Tavernier and Walter Van Doninck and Petra Van Mulders and Isis Van Parijs and Hugues Brun and Barbara Clerbaux and Gilles De Lentdecker and Hugo Delannoy and Giuseppe Fasanella and Laurent Favart and Reza Goldouzian and Anastasia Grebenyuk and Georgia Karapostoli and Thomas Lenzi and Alexandre Léonard and Jelena Luetic and Thierry Maerschalk and Andrey Marinov and Aidan Randle-conde and Tomislav Seva and C Vander Velde and P Vanlaer and D Vannerom and R Yonamine and F Zenoni and F Zhang and Anna Cimmino and Tom Cornelis and Didar Dobur and Alexis Fagot and Guillaume Garcia and Muhammad Gul and Illia Khvastunov and Deniz Poyraz and Sinem Salva and R Schöfbeck and Michael Tytgat and Ward Van Driessche and Efe Yazgan and Nikolaos Zaganidis and H Bakhshiansohi and C Beluffi and O Bondu and S Brochet and G Bruno and A Caudron and S De Visscher and C Delaere and M Delcourt and B Francois and A Giammanco and A Jafari and P Jez and M Komm and G Krintiras and V Lemaitre and A Magitteri and A Mertens and M Musich and C Nuttens and K Piotrzkowski and L Quertenmont and M Selvaggi and M Vidal Marono and S Wertz and N Beliy and WL Aldá Júnior and FL Alves and GA Alves and L Brito and C Hensel and A Moraes and ME Pol and P Rebello Teles and E Belchior Batista Das Chagas and W Carvalho and J Chinellato and A Custodio and EM Da Costa and GG Da Silveira and D De Jesus Damiao and C De Oliveira Martins and S Fonseca De Souza and LM Huertas Guativa and H Malbouisson and D Matos Figueiredo and C Mora Herrera and L Mundim and H Nogima and WL Prado Da Silva and A Santoro and A Sznajder and EJ Tonelli Manganote and A Vilela Pereira,31,18139769550410564224,Physics Letters B,,306-329,North-Holland,Measurements of the charm jet cross section and nuclear modification factor in pPb collisions at sNN= 5.02 TeV,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269317305294,772,2017,/scholar?cites=18139769550410564224,wa656rsAAAAJ:kJDgFkosVoMC

Data for mesons exhibit an expected peak dominated by effects associated with mini-jets and are well reproduced by general purpose Monte Carlo generators. However, for baryon-baryon and anti-baryon--anti-baryon pairs, where both particles have the same baryon number, a near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak.

15807,The ALICE collaboration performed the first rapidity-differential measurement of coherent J/ψ photoproduction in ultra-peripheral Pb–Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy s NN= 5.02 TeV. The J/ψ is detected via its dimuon decay in the forward rapidity region (− 4.0< y<− 2.5) for events where the hadronic activity is required to be minimal. The analysis is based on an event sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 750 μb− 1. The cross section for coherent J/ψ production is presented in six rapidity bins. The results are compared with theoretical models for coherent J/ψ photoproduction. These comparisons indicate that gluon shadowing effects play a role in the photoproduction process.

Therefore, the decision maker tends to miss the choice of the best possible solution.

The razor kinematic variables are sensitive to large mass differences between the parent particle and the invisible particles of a decay chain and help to identify the presence of SUSY particles.

In El Salvador there were 15 recorded tsunamis between 1859 and 2012, 3 of them causing damages and resulting in hundreds of victims. Hazard assessment is commonly based on propagation numerical models for earthquake-generated tsunamis and can be approached through both probabilistic and deterministic methods. A deterministic approximation has been applied in this study as it provides essential information for coastal planning and management. The objective of the research was twofold: on the one hand the characterization of the threat over the entire coast of El Salvador, and on the other the computation of flooding maps for the three main localities of the Salvadorian coast. For the latter we developed high-resolution flooding models. For the former, due to the extension of the coastal area, we computed maximum elevations maps, and from the elevation in the near shore we computed an estimation of the run-up and the flooded area using empirical relations. We have considered local sources located in the Middle America Trench, characterized seismotectonically, and distant sources in the rest of Pacific Basin, using historical and recent earthquakes and tsunamis. We used a hybrid finite differences-finite volumes numerical model in this work, based on the linear and non-linear shallow water equations, to simulate a total of 24 earthquake-generated tsunami scenarios.

Two independent methods to identify photons from such decays were employed. In the first method, the photon was detected in the electromagnetic calorimeter. In the second method, the photon was identified by an electron-positron pair produced through the external photon conversion before the tracking detector volume.

15916,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cardiovascular features of Ullrich-Turner's syndrome using echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, and to correlate them with the phenotype and karyotype of the patients. The diagnostic concordance between the 2 methods was also assessed. METHODS: Fifteen patients with the syndrome were assessed by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac chambers, valves, and aorta). Their ages ranged from 10 to 28 (mean of 16.7) years. The karyotype was analyzed in 11 or 25 metaphases of peripheral blood lymphocytes, or both. RESULTS: The most common phenotypic changes were short stature and spontaneous absence of puberal development (100%); 1 patient had a cardiac murmur. The karyotypes detected were as follows: 45,X (n=7), mosaics (n=5), and deletions (n=3). No echocardiographic changes were observed. In regard to magnetic resonance imaging, coarctation and dilation of the aorta were found in 1 patient, and isolated dilation of the aorta was found in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: The frequencies of coarctation and dilation of the aorta detected on magnetic resonance imaging were similar to those reported in the literature (5.5% to 20%, and 6.3% to 29%, respectively).

15930,"At the core of attosecond science lies the ability to generate laser pulses of subfemtosecond duration. In tabletop devices the process relies on high-harmonic generation, where a major challenge is to obtain high yields and high cutoff energies required for the generation of attosecond pulses. We develop a computational method that can simultaneously resolve these issues by optimizing the driving pulses using quantum optimal control theory. Our target functional, an integral over the harmonic yield over a desired energy range, leads to a remarkable cutoff extension and yield enhancement for a one-dimensional model H atom. The physical enhancement process is shown to be twofold: the cutoff extension is of classical origin, whereas the yield enhancement arises from increased tunneling probability.

15942,"This Letter presents the first experimental observation of the attractive strong interaction between a proton and a multistrange baryon (hyperon) Ξ−. The result is extracted from two-particle correlations of combined p− Ξ−⊕ p− Ξ+ pairs measured in p− Pb collisions at s NN= 5.02 TeV at the LHC with ALICE. The measured correlation function is compared with the prediction obtained assuming only an attractive Coulomb interaction and a standard deviation in the range [3.6, 5.3] is found. Since the measured p− Ξ−⊕ p− Ξ+ correlation is significantly enhanced with respect to the Coulomb prediction, the presence of an additional, strong, attractive interaction is evident. The data are compatible with recent lattice calculations by the HAL-QCD Collaboration, with a standard deviation in the range [1.8, 3.7].

15952,"High harmonic generation (HHG) provides a flexible framework for the development of coherent light sources in the extreme-ultraviolet and soft X-ray regimes. However it suffers from low conversion efficiencies as the control of the HHG spectral and temporal characteristics requires manipulating electron trajectories on attosecond time scale. The phase matching mechanism has been employed to selectively enhance specific quantum paths leading to HHG. A few important fundamental questions remain open, among those how much of the enhancement can be achieved by the single-emitter and what is the role of correlations (or the electronic structure) in the selectivity and control of HHG generation. Here we address those questions by examining computationally the possibility of optimizing the HHG spectrum of isolated hydrogen and helium atoms by shaping the slowly varying envelope of a 800 nm …",Alberto Castro and Angel Rubio and Eberhard KU Gross,23,451329592839821965,The European Physical Journal B,8,191,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,Enhancing and controlling single-atom high-harmonic generation spectra: a time-dependent density-functional scheme,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjb/e2015-50889-7,88,2015,/scholar?cites=451329592839821965,wa656rsAAAAJ:nlmsuG0oqtYC

We evaluate the graviton one-loop determinant on the Euclidean BTZ background with parity-violating boundary conditions (CSS), and find excellent agreement with the dual warped CFT.

15970,"We present the first azimuthally differential measurements of the pion source size relative to the second harmonic event plane in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon pair of s N N= 2.76 TeV. The measurements have been performed in the centrality range 0%–50% and for pion pair transverse momenta 0.2< k T< 0.7 GeV/c. We find that the R side and R out radii, which characterize the pion source size in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the pion transverse momentum, oscillate out of phase, similar to what was observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The final-state source eccentricity, estimated via R side oscillations, is found to be significantly smaller than the initial-state source eccentricity, but remains positive—indicating that even after a stronger expansion in the in-plane direction, the pion source at the freeze-out is still elongated in the out-of-plane direction.

15971,"We report on a search for charged massive resonances decaying to top (t) and bottom (b) quarks in the full data set of proton-antiproton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of s= 1.96 TeV collected by the CDF II detector at the Tevatron, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.5 fb− 1. No significant excess above the standard model background prediction is observed. We set 95% Bayesian credibility mass-dependent upper limits on the heavy charged-particle production cross section times branching ratio to t b. Using a standard model extension with a W′→ t b and left-right-symmetric couplings as a benchmark model, we constrain the W′ mass and couplings in the 300–900 GeV/c 2 range.

15972,We present a search for associated production of the standard model Higgs boson and a Z boson where the Z boson decays to two leptons and the Higgs decays to a pair of b quarks in p p collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron. We use event probabilities based on standard model matrix elements to construct a likelihood function of the Higgs content of the data sample. In a CDF data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb− 1 we see no evidence of a Higgs boson with a mass between 100 GeV/c 2 and 150 GeV/c 2. We set 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross section for Z H production as a function of the Higgs boson mass m H; the limit is 8.2 times the standard model prediction at m H= 115 GeV/c 2.,Timo Aaltonen and J Adelman and T Akimoto and B Álvarez González and S Amerio and D Amidei and A Anastassov and A Annovi and J Antos and G Apollinari and A Apresyan and T Arisawa and A Artikov and W Ashmanskas and A Attal and A Aurisano and F Azfar and W Badgett and A Barbaro-Galtieri and VE Barnes and BA Barnett and P Barria and V Bartsch and G Bauer and P-H Beauchemin and F Bedeschi and D Beecher and S Behari and G Bellettini and J Bellinger and D Benjamin and Andrew Beretvas and J Beringer and A Bhatti and M Binkley and D Bisello and I Bizjak and RE Blair and C Blocker and B Blumenfeld and A Bocci and A Bodek and V Boisvert and G Bolla and D Bortoletto and J Boudreau and A Boveia and B Brau and A Bridgeman and L Brigliadori and C Bromberg and E Brubaker and J Budagov and HS Budd and S Budd and S Burke and K Burkett and G Busetto and P Bussey and A Buzatu and KL Byrum and S Cabrera and C Calancha and M Campanelli and M Campbell and F Canelli and A Canepa and B Carls and D Carlsmith and R Carosi and S Carrillo and S Carron and B Casal and M Casarsa and A Castro and P Catastini and D Cauz and V Cavaliere and M Cavalli-Sforza and A Cerri and L Cerrito and SH Chang and YC Chen and M Chertok and G Chiarelli and G Chlachidze and F Chlebana and K Cho and D Chokheli and JP Chou and G Choudalakis and SH Chuang and K Chung and WH Chung and YS Chung and T Chwalek and CI Ciobanu and MARIA AGNESE Ciocci and A Clark and D Clark and G Compostella and ME Convery and J Conway and M Cordelli and G Cortiana and CA Cox and DJ Cox and F Crescioli and C Cuenca Almenar and J Cuevas and R Culbertson and JC Cully and D Dagenhart and M Datta and T Davies and P De Barbaro and S De Cecco and A Deisher and G De Lorenzo and MAURO Dell’Orso and C Deluca and L Demortier and J Deng and M Deninno and PF Derwent and A Di Canto and GP Di Giovanni and Carlo Dionisi and B Di Ruzza and JR Dittmann and M D’Onofrio and SIMONE Donati and P Dong and J Donini and T Dorigo and S Dube and J Efron and A Elagin and R Erbacher and D Errede and S Errede and R Eusebi and HC Fang and S Farrington and WT Fedorko and RG Feild and M Feindt and JP Fernandez and C Ferrazza and R Field,22,3974881126045478034,Physical Review D,7,071101,American Physical Society,Search for the Higgs boson produced in association with  using the matrix element method at CDF II,https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.071101,80,2009,/scholar?cites=3974881126045478034,wa656rsAAAAJ:-mAZECE-jN4C
15973,"We report the first measurement of the top quark mass using the decay length technique in p p collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. This technique uses the measured flight distance of the b hadron to infer the mass of the top quark in lepton plus jets events with missing transverse energy. It relies solely on tracking and avoids the jet energy scale uncertainty that is common to all other methods used so far. We apply our novel method to a 695 pb− 1 data sample recorded by the CDF II detector at Fermilab and extract a measurement of m t= 180.7− 13.4+ 15.5 (stat.)±8.6 (syst.) GeV/c 2. While the uncertainty of this result is larger than that of other measurements, the dominant uncertainties in the decay length technique are uncorrelated with those in other methods.
