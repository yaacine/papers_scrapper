13001,"Interleukin 17 (IL-17) has been linked to autoimmune diseases, although its regulation and function have remained unclear. Here we have evaluated in vitro and in vivo the requirements for the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into effector T helper cells that produce IL-17. This process required the costimulatory molecules CD28 and ICOS but was independent of the cytokines and transcription factors required for T helper type 1 or type 2 differentiation. Furthermore, both IL-4 and interferon-γ negatively regulated T helper cell production of IL-17 in the effector phase. In vivo, antibody to IL-17 inhibited chemokine expression in the brain during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas overexpression of IL-17 in lung epithelium caused chemokine production and leukocyte infiltration. Thus, IL-17 expression characterizes a unique T helper lineage that regulates tissue inflammation.",Heon Park and Zhaoxia Li and Xuexian O Yang and Seon Hee Chang and Roza Nurieva and Yi-Hong Wang and Ying Wang and Leroy Hood and Zhou Zhu and Qiang Tian and Chen Dong,5080,7418145759790245346,Nature immunology,11,1133-1141,Nature Publishing Group,A distinct lineage of CD4 T cells regulates tissue inflammation by producing interleukin 17,https://www.nature.com/articles/ni1261/,6,2005,/scholar?cites=7418145759790245346,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC

In this 365-megabase vertebrate genome, repetitive DNA accounts for less than one-sixth of the sequence, and gene loci occupy about one-third of the genome. As with the human genome, gene loci are not evenly distributed, but are clustered into sparse and dense regions. Some “giant” genes were observed that had average coding sequence sizes but were spread over genomic lengths significantly larger than those of their human orthologs.

Strong selective pressure for recognition of and response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns has maintained a largely unchanging TLR recognition in all vertebrates. There are six major families of vertebrate TLRs. This repertoire is distinct from that of invertebrates. TLRs within a family recognize a general class of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Most vertebrates have exactly one gene ortholog for each TLR family. The family including TLR1 has more species-specific adaptations than other families.

13018,"(NRC) Committee on the Mapping and Sequencing of the Human Genome, on which the present authors served, recommended a staged mapping and sequencing project with early emphases on physical mapping of human DNA, mapping and sequencing of the genomes of model organisms, and the development of sequencing technology (1). As the Committee’s recommendations on physical mapping are beginning to be implemented on a substantial scale, it is timely to review these recommendations in the light of recent technical advances. In particular, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)(2), a method that has only come into widespread use during the past 2 years, seems to us to offer a path toward a physical map that largely circumvents two problems that were prominent in the NRC Committee’s discussions. One of these was the difficulty of merging mapping data gathered by diverse methods in different laboratories into a consensus physical map. The second was the logistics and expense of managing the huge collections of cloned segments on which the mapping data would depend almost absolutely. By allowing short DNA sequences to be detected easily with high specificity and sensitivity, PCR makes practical the use of DNA sequence itself to define the basic landmarks on the physical map. We advocate the use of short tracts of single-copy DNA sequence (that is, sequences that occur only once in the genome) that can be easily recovered at any time by PCR as the landmarks that define position on the physical map.

Despite some similarities, T-cell antigen recognition and function are different in several important respects from the corresponding processes in B cells. First, T cells recognize only antigens that are present on the surfaces of other cells in the context of polymorphic cell-surface molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)(1-3).

We have applied the automated PCR/OLA procedure to diagnosis of common genetic diseases, such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis (delta F508 mutation), and to genetic linkage mapping of gene segments in the human T-cell receptor beta-chain locus. The automated PCR/OLA strategy provides a rapid system for diagnosis of genetic, malignant, and infectious diseases as well as a powerful approach to genetic linkage mapping of chromosomes and forensic DNA typing.",Deborah A Nickerson and Robert Kaiser and Stephen Lappin and Jason Stewart and Leroy Hood and Ulf Landegren,481,17825378210790586240,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,22,8923-8927,National Academy of Sciences,Automated DNA diagnostics using an ELISA-based oligonucleotide ligation assay.,https://www.pnas.org/content/87/22/8923.short,87,1990,/scholar?cites=17825378210790586240,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:9ZlFYXVOiuMC
13066,"Genes regulated by androgenic hormones are of critical importance for the normal physiological function of the human prostate gland, and they contribute to the development and progression of prostate carcinoma. We used cDNA microarrays containing 1500 cDNAs to profile transcripts regulated by androgens in prostate cancer cells and identified the serine protease TMPRSS2 as a gene exhibiting increased expression upon exposure to androgens. The TMPRSS2 gene is located on chromosome 21 and contains four distinct domains, including a transmembrane region, indicating that it is expressed on the cell surface. Northern analysis demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in prostate epithelium relative to other normal human tissues. In situ hybridization of normal and malignant prostate tissues localizes TMPRSS2 expression to prostate basal cells and to prostate carcinoma.

13070,Peptide binding and lymph node T cell activation studies have been used to characterize T cell recognition of an encephalitogenic T cell autoantigen from myelin basic protein in (PL J× SJL) F1 mice. Amino acids that determine interactions with either the restriction element of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or the encephalitogenic T cell receptor are defined. This information enables the design of peptides that bind MHC yet do not cross-react with the autoantigen. A peptide analog of the encephalitogenic epitope is shown to be “heteroclitic” for MHC binding and activation of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro.

In mice, widespread deletion of the tumor suppressor Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) generates hamartomatous intestinal polyps with epithelial and stromal involvement. Using this model, we have established the relationship between stem cells and polyp and tumor formation. PTEN helps govern the proliferation rate and number of ISCs and loss of PTEN results in an excess of ISCs. In PTEN-deficient mice, excess ISCs initiate de novo crypt formation and crypt fission, recapitulating crypt production in fetal and neonatal intestine.

We have introduced an MBP transgene into mld mice and found that myelination increases and tremors and convulsions decrease. Mld and shiverer mice with zero, one, or two copies of the MBP transgene express distinct levels of MBP mRNA and myelin. The availability of a range of mice expressing graded levels of myelin should facilitate …",Brian Popko and Carmie Puckett and Eric Lai and H David Shine and Carol Readhead and Naoki Takahashi and Stephen W Hunt III and Richard L Sidman and Leroy Hood,227,11381545334454195682,Cell,4,713-721,Cell Press,Myelin deficient mice: expression of myelin basic protein and generation of mice with varying levels of myelin,https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/0092-8674(87)90249-2.pdf,48,1987,/scholar?cites=11381545334454195682,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:V3AGJWp-ZtQC

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates many of the proinflammatory and procoagulant responses of endothelial cells, and endothelial injury is thought to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of septic shock due to Gram-negative bacteria. The receptor used by LPS to signal endothelial responses has not been identified. It is also not known how LPS induces endothelial injury/death.

The alpha-acetylated, NH2-terminal nine amino acids (1-9NAc) of myelin basic protein (MBP) represents the dominant T cell epitope for the induction of EAE in the B10.PL (H-2u) strain. We tolerized neonatal B10.PL mice to 1-9NAc and studied the proliferative responses to this peptide and to whole MBP. Mice exposed to 1-9NAc in the neonatal period were tolerant to subsequent challenge at the proliferative T cell level. Similarly, in the 1-9NAc-tolerant group, both the incidence and severity of 1-9NAc induced EAE were greatly reduced. The fact that we were able to tolerize mice normally responsive to MBP suggests that this self antigen is sequestered (within the central nervous system) and hence tolerance to it is not normally induced.

We also determined that serine 330 and threonine 366 of NDRG1 were phosphorylated and demonstrated that the phosphorylation of NDRG1 was prominently mediated by protein kinase A (PKA). Further, we showed that NDRG1 directly binds to β-catenin and E-cadherin. However, the phosphorylation of NDRG1 did not interrupt the binding of NDRG1 to E-cadherin and β-catenin. Finally, we showed that the inhibition of NDRG1 expression by RNA interference decreased the ER inducible chaperon GRP94 expression, directly proving that NDRG1 is involved in the ER stress response. Intriguingly, we observed that many members of the NDRG1 interactome are androgen-regulated and that the NDRG1 interactome links to the androgen response network through common interactions with β-catenin and heat …",Lan Chun Tu and Xiaowei Yan and Leroy Hood and Biaoyang Lin,127,9115078225950992640,Molecular & Cellular Proteomics,4,575-588,American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Proteomics analysis of the interactome of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 and its interactions with the androgen response program in prostate cancer cells,https://www.mcponline.org/content/6/4/575.short,6,2007,/scholar?cites=9115078225950992640,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:2VqYfGB8ITEC

When used to compare normal tissues and tissues at various stages of disease, or diseased tissues with different responses to treatment, arrays present opportunities for improved disease diagnosis and a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of observed phenotypes. Several machine learning methods have been applied to array data to classify genes on the basis of their expression levels in particular samples, and to classify tissue samples on the basis of their global patterns of gene expression [2-4, 9, 12, 21]. These tasks are made more difficult by the noisy nature of array data, and when classifying tissues, by the overwhelming number of gene attributes relative to the number of training samples.

13310,Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain and are classified on the basis of their activation by different agonists. The agonists kainate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxasolepropionic acid define a class of glutamate receptors termed kainate receptors. We have isolated and sequenced a human glutamate receptor (GluHI) cDNA and determined the chromosomal localization of its gene. The DNA sequence of GluHI would encode a 907-amino acid protein that has a 97% identity to one of the rodent kainate receptor subunits. Many of the changes between the predicted amino acid sequence of GluHI and the most similar rodent kainate receptor (GluRI) occur in a region of the protein encoded in rodents by an alternatively spliced exon. The extreme conservation between the human and rat kainate receptor subunits suggests that a similar gene …,Carmie Puckett and Christopher M Gomez and Julie R Korenberg and Howard Tung and Timothy J Meier and X Ning Chen and Leroy Hood,100,9417588090034355605,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,17,7557-7561,National Academy of Sciences,Molecular cloning and chromosomal localization of one of the human glutamate receptor genes,https://www.pnas.org/content/88/17/7557.short,88,1991,/scholar?cites=9417588090034355605,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC

Because phosphorylation sites cannot be predicted with certainty from primary structure alone, there is a need for methodology to determine the sites experimentally.

13321,"Using Southern DNA hybridization techniques, restriction enzyme site polymorphisms have been used to correlate the molecular maps of the murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I region with the genetic map derived from analyses of recombinant mouse strains. The data indicated that the DNA that maps between the IA and IE subregions is limited to 3.4 kilobases (kb) and includes the 3'end of the E beta gene. According to classical genetic mapping by recombinational analysis of serological markers, this region should encode the IB and IJ subregions. These observations are surprising in two respects. First, 3.4 kb is a small amount of DNA to encode even one complete murine gene. Second, this region, which putatively encodes the IJ gene, appears to reside at least partially within the E beta gene. To analyze these apparent paradoxes, further, we cloned the 3.4-kb region in question from six I-region combinant strains [B10. A (3R), B10. a (5R), B10. A (4R), B10. GD, B10. HTT, and B10.

The AR can act either as a promoter or a tumor suppressor depending on cell types. The AR proliferative response program has been well studied, but its prohibitive response program has not yet been thoroughly studied.  Methodology/Principal Findings Previous studies found that PC3 cells expressing the wild-type AR inhibit growth and suppress invasion. We applied expression profiling to identify the response program of PC3 cells expressing the AR (PC3-AR) under different growth conditions (i.e. with or without androgens and at different concentration of androgens) and then applied the newly developed ChIP-seq technology to identify the AR binding regions in the PC3 cancer genome. A surprising finding was that the comparison of MOCK-transfected PC3 cells with AR-transfected cells identified 3,452 differentially expressed genes (two fold cutoff) even without the addition of androgens (i.e. in ethanol control), suggesting that a ligand independent activation or extremely low-level androgen activation of the AR. ChIP-Seq analysis revealed 6,629 AR binding regions in the cancer genome of PC3 cells with an FDR (false discovery rate) cut off of 0.05. About 22.4% (638 of 2,849) can be mapped to within 2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS). Three novel AR binding motifs were identified in the AR binding regions of PC3-AR cells, and two of them share a core consensus sequence CGAGCTCTTC, which together mapped to 27.3% of AR binding regions (1,808/6,629).

However, the process of being able to accurately identify miRNA is still a complex and difficult task, requiring the integration of experimental approaches with computational methods. A number of prediction algorisms based on characteristics of miRNA molecules have been developed to identify new miRNA species. Different approaches have certain strengths and weaknesses and, in this review, we aim to summarize several commonly used tools in miRNA discovery and provide some prospects on future developments.",Clarissa Pedrosa Da Costa Gomes and Ji-Hoon Cho and Leroy E Hood and Octavio Luiz Franco and Rinaldo Wellerson Dr Pereira and Kai Wang,91,1361773983433897052,Frontiers in genetics,,81,Frontiers,A review of computational tools in microRNA discovery,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2013.00081/full,4,2013,/scholar?cites=1361773983433897052,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:0ngZmJvimKcC
13332,"Bacteriorhodopsin, the light-driven proton pump of Halobacterium salinarum, consists of the membrane apoprotein bacterioopsin and a covalently bound retinal cofactor. The mechanism by which retinal is synthesized and bound to bacterioopsinin vivo is unknown. As a step toward identifying cellular factors involved in this process, we constructed an in-frame deletion of brp, a gene implicated in bacteriorhodopsin biogenesis. In the Δbrp strain, bacteriorhodopsin levels are decreased ∼4.0-fold compared with wild type, whereas bacterioopsin levels are normal. The probable precursor of retinal, β-carotene, is increased ∼3.8-fold, whereas retinal is decreased by ∼3.7-fold. These results suggest that brp is involved in retinal synthesis.

13342,"A powerful way to separate signal from noise in biology is to convert the molecular data from individual genes or proteins into an analysis of comparative biological network behaviors. One of the limitations of previous network analyses is that they do not take into account the combinatorial nature of gene interactions within the network. We report here a new technique, Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC), which permits one to assess these combinatorial interactions to quantify various biological pathways or networks in a comparative sense, and to determine how they change in different individuals experiencing the same disease process. This approach is based on the relative expression values of participating genes—i.e., the ordering of expression within network profiles. DIRAC provides quantitative measures of how network rankings differ either among networks for a selected phenotype or among phenotypes for a selected network. We examined disease phenotypes including cancer subtypes and neurological disorders and identified networks that are tightly regulated, as defined by high conservation of transcript ordering. Interestingly, we observed a strong trend to looser network regulation in more malignant phenotypes and later stages of disease. At a sample level, DIRAC can detect a change in ranking between phenotypes for any selected network. Variably expressed networks represent statistically robust differences between disease states and serve as signatures for accurate molecular classification, validating the information about expression patterns captured by DIRAC.

Methodology/Principal Findings Applying a next generation sequencing technology, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), we identified a total of 4535 genes that are differentially expressed between normal brain and GBM tissue. The expression changes of three up-regulated genes, CHI3L1, CHI3L2, and FOXM1, and two down-regulated genes, neurogranin and L1CAM, were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Pathway analysis revealed that TGF- β pathway related genes were significantly up-regulated in GBM tumor samples. An integrative pathway analysis of the TGF β signaling network identified two alternative TGF−β signaling pathways mediated by SOX4 (sex determining region Y-box 4) and TGFBI (Transforming growth factor beta induced). Quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that SOX4 and TGFBI expression is elevated in GBM tissues compared with normal brain tissues at both the RNA and protein levels. In vitro functional studies confirmed that TGFBI and SOX4 expression is increased by TGF- β stimulation and decreased by a specific inhibitor of TGF- β receptor 1 kinase.

For example, the development of disease-related biomarker panels will require fast and efficient methods for obtaining multiparameter protein profiles. We established a high throughput, label-free method for analyzing serum using surface plasmon resonance imaging of antibody microarrays. Microarrays were fabricated using standard pin spotting on bare gold substrates, and samples were applied for binding analysis using a camera-based surface plasmon resonance system. We validated the system by measuring the concentrations of four serum proteins using part of a 792-feature microarray. Transferrin concentrations were measured to be 2.1 mg/ml in human serum and 1.2 mg/ml in murine serum, which closely matched ELISA determinations of 2.6 and 1.2 mg/ml, respectively. In agreement with expected values, human and mouse albumin levels were measured to be 24.3 and 23.6 mg/ml, respectively. The lower limits of detection for the four measurements ranged from 14 to 58 ng/ml or 175 to 755 pm. Where purified target proteins are not available for calibration, the microarrays can be used for relative protein quantification. We used the antibody microarray to compare the serum protein profiles from three liver cancer patients and three non-liver cancer patients.

13373,"We stand at the brink of a fundamental change in how medicine will be practiced. Over the next 5-20 years medicine will move from being largely reactive to being predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory (P4). Technology and new scientific strategies have always been the drivers of revolutions and this is certainly the case for P4 medicine, where a systems approach to disease, new and emerging technologies and powerful computational tools will open new windows for the investigation of disease. Systems approaches are driving the emergence of fascinating new technologies that will permit billions of measurements on each individual patient. The challenge for health information technology will be how to reduce this enormous amount of data to simple hypotheses about health and disease. We predict that emerging technologies, together with the systems approaches to diagnosis, therapy and prevention will lead to a down turn in the escalating costs of healthcare. In time we will be able to export P4 medicine to the developing world and it will become the foundation of global medicine. The"" democratization"" of healthcare will come from P4 medicine.

The integration of such complex and heterogeneous Big Data from multiple sources offers unparalleled opportunities to study the early stages of prevalent neurodegenerative processes, track their progression and quickly identify the efficacies of alternative treatments. Many previous human and animal studies have examined the relationship of Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk to trauma, genetics, environment, co-morbidities, or life style. The defining characteristics of Big Data–large size, incongruency, incompleteness, complexity, multiplicity of scales, and heterogeneity of information-generating sources–all pose challenges to the classical techniques for data management, processing, visualization and interpretation. We propose, implement, test and validate complementary model-based and model-free approaches for PD classification and prediction. To explore PD risk using Big Data methodology, we jointly processed complex PPMI imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data.   Methods and Findings Collective representation of the multi-source data facilitates the aggregation and harmonization of complex data elements. This enables joint modeling of the complete data, leading to the development of Big Data analytics, predictive synthesis, and statistical validation.

These cells function as efficient antigen-presenting cells (APC) in stimulating peptide antigen-specific MHC-restricted proliferation of long-term T-cell lines, thus establishing the capacity of Ia-expressing L-cell transfectants to present antigens to apparently normal T cells. However, in contrast to splenic APC, L-cell transfectants fail to present native hen egg-white lysozyme to the same T cells. Since this result is similar to that obtained with physiologic APC pretreated to prevent antigen degradation, it suggests that L-cell transfectants, without such pretreatments, may be compromised in their ability to process native lysozyme.

Subsequent analysis of embryos from heterozygous matings detected Dad1 null (−/−) embryos at E3.5 but no later, suggesting Dad1 is required for development beyond the late blastocyst stage.

13482,"Truncated variants of the gene encoding H-2Ld, an integral membrane protein encoded by the major histocompatibility complex, were constructed by in vitro mutagenesis to elucidate the function of charged amino acids found on the cytoplasmic side of the transmembrane (TM) region. Analysis of cloned L cells transfected with these genes shows that the seven amino acids following the TM segment, four of which are basic, enhance the cell surface expression of H-2Ld protein but are not required for it. However, some clones do not express a tailless H-2Ld protein on the cell surface but express it intracellularly where it has a long half-life.

Attempts have been made to employ extinction therapy, which is aimed at attenuating the incentive motivational effects of cocaine cues, as a treatment for cocaine addiction; however, this approach has been largely unsuccessful perhaps due to the inability to extinguish all cues associated with cocaine use while in a clinic. Recently, environmental enrichment (EE) during abstinence has been proposed as a strategy to attenuate cue-elicited cocaine craving. The present study used an animal model to examine whether the utility of extinction toward attenuating cue-elicited cocaine-seeking behavior could be enhanced by also providing EE.

13510,"The determination of the relationship between a pair of individuals is a fundamental application of genetics. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that identity-by-descent (IBD) information generated from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data can greatly improve the power and accuracy of genetic relationship detection. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) marks the final step in increasing genetic marker density by assaying all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), and thus has the potential to further improve relationship detection by enabling more accurate detection of IBD segments and more precise resolution of IBD segment boundaries. However, WGS introduces new complexities that must be addressed in order to achieve these improvements in relationship detection. To evaluate these complexities, we estimated genetic relationships from WGS data for 1490 known pairwise relationships among 258 individuals in 30 families along with 46 population samples as controls. We identified several genomic regions with excess pairwise IBD in both the pedigree and control datasets using three established IBD methods: GERMLINE, fastIBD, and ISCA. These spurious IBD segments produced a 10-fold increase in the rate of detected false-positive relationships among controls compared to high-density microarray datasets. To address this issue, we developed a new method to identify and mask genomic regions with excess IBD.

13517,"The identification and characterization of the complete ensemble of genes is a main goal of deciphering the digital information stored in the human genome. Many algorithms for computational gene prediction have been described, ultimately derived from two basic concepts: (1) modeling gene structure and (2) recognizing sequence similarity. Successful hybrid methods combining these two concepts have also been developed. We present a third orthogonal approach to gene prediction, based on detecting the genomic signatures of transcription, accumulated over evolutionary time. We discuss four algorithms based on this third concept: Greens and CHOWDER, which quantify mutational strand biases caused by transcription-coupled DNA repair, and ROAST and PASTA, which are based on strand-specific selection against polyadenylation signals. We combined these algorithms into an integrated method called FEAST, which we used to predict the location and orientation of thousands of putative transcription units not overlapping known genes. Many of the newly predicted transcriptional units do not appear to code for proteins. The new algorithms are particularly apt at detecting genes with long introns and lacking sequence conservation. They therefore complement existing gene prediction methods and will help identify functional transcripts within many apparent “genomic deserts.”",Gustavo Glusman and Shizhen Qin and M Raafat El-Gewely and Andrew F Siegel and Jared C Roach and Leroy Hood and Arian FA Smit,51,6617479759535611032,PLoS computational biology,3,e18,Public Library of Science,A third approach to gene prediction suggests thousands of additional human transcribed regions,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020018,2,2006,/scholar?cites=6617479759535611032,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:-mN3Mh-tlDkC

These proteins comprise 5-10% of the total CSF protein and their mass, charge, abundance and predominance in CSF over plasma are consistent with a protein that had been initially characterized with antibodies, beta-trace protein.

Computer-aided analyses of this sequence reveal the presence of at least 11 genic regions that are closely related to the human T-cell receptor [beta] variable region (TCRBV) gene family. These include five germline sequences that have previously been determined, V[beta]21.2, V[beta]8.1, V[beta]8.2, V[beta]8.3, and V[beta]16, and four whose sequences have partially been determined at the mRNA level, V[beta]6, V[beta]23, V[beta]12.2, V[beta]24. The two remaining V[beta] Tcr-related sequences have eluded discovery by cDNA and RT-PCR cloning and genomic blot hybridization methods. These two V[beta] Tcr-related genes lack >75% nucleotide sequence identity with any other V[beta] Tcr gene member and therefore, by convention, are referred to as new subfamily members V[beta]25 and V[beta]26. This lack of shared identity with other subfamily members explains why they were not detected by hybridization. The promoter regions of these V[beta] Tcr genes contain the conserved Tcr decamer element located between 80 and 110 bp 5' of the translation start site, generally near a putative TATAA promoter element.

Recent evidence indicates that HLA-A2-restricted, melanoma-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) recognize melanomas obtained from different HLA-A2+ patients, suggesting the presence of one or more common melanoma antigens. Furthermore, T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis by other groups of TILs from fresh melanoma biopsies suggests that there is limited TCR V gene usage in TILs. One serious limitation in analyzing the TCR repertoire in fresh tumors has been the inability to correlate TCR usage with immune function. Therefore, the TCR repertoire was determined in long-term TIL cultures that specifically lysed autologous melanoma in vitro and in many cases mediated in vivo regression of metastatic cancer in patients with advanced disease.

Moreover, with great success, Jim almost single-handedly directed a program, during its initial years, which will fundamentally change science and medicine as we move into the twenty-first century.

13593,"During prion infections of the central nervous system (CNS) the cellular prion protein, PrPC, is templated to a conformationally distinct form, PrPSc. Recent studies have demonstrated that the Sprn gene encodes a GPI-linked glycoprotein Shadoo (Sho), which localizes to a similar membrane environment as PrPC and is reduced in the brains of rodents with terminal prion disease. Here, analyses of prion-infected mice revealed that down-regulation of Sho protein was not related to Sprn mRNA abundance at any stage in prion infection. Down-regulation was robust upon propagation of a variety of prion strains in Prnpa and Prnpb mice, with the exception of the mouse-adapted BSE strain 301 V. In addition, Sho encoded by a TgSprn transgene was down-regulated to the same extent as endogenous Sho. Reduced Sho levels were not seen in a tauopathy, in chemically induced spongiform degeneration or in transgenic mice expressing the extracellular ADan amyloid peptide of familial Danish dementia. Insofar as prion-infected Prnp hemizygous mice exhibited accumulation of PrPSc and down-regulation of Sho hundreds of days prior to onset of neurologic symptoms, Sho depletion can be excluded as an important trigger for clinical disease or as a simple consequence of neuronal damage. These studies instead define a disease-specific effect, and we hypothesize that membrane-associated Sho comprises a bystander substrate for processes degrading PrPSc. Thus, while protease-resistant PrP detected by in vitro digestion allows post mortem diagnosis, decreased levels of endogenous Sho may trace an early response to PrPSc accumulation that …",David Westaway and Sacha Genovesi and Nathalie Daude and Rebecca Brown and Agnes Lau and Inyoul Lee and Charles E Mays and Janaky Coomaraswamy and Brenda Canine and Rose Pitstick and Allen Herbst and Jing Yang and Kerry WS Ko and Gerold Schmitt-Ulms and Stephen J DeArmond and Debbie McKenzie and Leroy Hood and George A Carlson,38,11699001404076876739,PLoS pathogens,11,e1002391,Public Library of Science,Down-regulation of Shadoo in prion infections traces a pre-clinical event inversely related to PrPSc accumulation,https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002391,7,2011,/scholar?cites=11699001404076876739,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:c_xDhezhKKUC

13598,"Posttranslational modifications of proteins play an important role in biology. For example, phosphorylation is a key component in signal transduction in all three domains of life, and histones can be modified in such a variety of ways that a histone code for gene regulation has been proposed. Shotgun proteomics is commonly used to identify posttranslational modifications as well as chemical modifications from sample processing. However, it favors the detection of abundant peptides over the repertoire presented, and the data analysis usually requires advance specification of modification masses and target amino acids, their number constrained by available computational resources. Recent advances in data independent acquisition mass spectrometry technologies such as SWATH-MS enable a deeper recording of the peptide contents of samples, including peptides with modifications. Here, we present a novel approach that applies the power of SWATH-MS analysis to the automated pursuit of modified peptides. With the new SWATHProphetPTM functionality added to the open source SWATHProphet software, precursor ions consistent with a modification are identified along with the mass and localization of the modification in the peptide sequence in a sensitive and unrestricted manner without the need to anticipate the modifications in advance.

To examine the role of alpha 1 and alpha 2 regions in antibody and CTL recognition, the third exon of H-2Dd, Kd, and Ld transplantation antigen genes was replaced by the homologous coding region of the Qa-2-coded class I gene, Q6.

13619,"Evolution is a tangible and dynamic aspect of biological communities. However, while evidence of its occurrence is overwhelming, its precise nature is much more obscure. The pioneering work of Haldane, Fisher, Wright, and others in the 1920s and 1930s laid the theoretical framework for population genetics. From this foundation, Huxley, in the early 1940s, developed the first widely accepted model for evolutionary change and the forces involved—the “modern synthesis” or Neodarwinism. This theory is essentially a marriage of Mendelian genetics and classic Darwinian selection and has been a cornerstone of modern biological thought. Today, however, the theory of evolution as embodied by Neodarwinism is a theory in some turmoil. There are phyletic gradualists and punctuated equilibrists. There are strict selectionists and just as strict neutralists. There are altruistic genes that turn out to be selfish. There are even reports that acquired traits can be inherited. Unfortunately, classic paleontological and taxonomic approaches to these and other issues and problems have yielded results too equiv-ocal for general consensus. Even the refinement of taxonomy to the biochemical level has stirred as much controversy as it has shed light. In just the last few years, exciting technological advances in the field of molecular genetics have been responsible for a revolutionary new view of the structure and organization of genetic information.",Tim Hunkapiller and Henry Huang and Leroy Hood and John H Campbell,35,9785662838246302549,Perspectives on evolution,,164-189,"Sinauer Sunderland, MA",The impact of modern genetics on evolutionary theory,http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9785662838246302549&hl=en&oi=scholarr,,1982,/scholar?cites=9785662838246302549,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:Dem6FJhTUoYC

Problem clones are defined as clones for which either (A) there is no identifiable overlapping STC to extend the sequence in a particular direction or …",Andrew F Siegel and Barbara Trask and Jared C Roach and Gregory G Mahairas and Leroy Hood and Ger van den Engh,32,4098153499684634462,Genome research,3,297-307,Cold Spring Harbor Lab,Analysis of sequence-tagged-connector strategies for DNA sequencing,https://genome.cshlp.org/content/9/3/297.short,9,1999,/scholar?cites=4098153499684634462,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:-95Q15plzcUC

Because of the close similarity in the V domains of these proteins and the extensive idiotypic analyses that have been carried out previously, several interesting conclusions can be drawn about the nature of idiotypic determinants. First, a single amino acid residue may be involved in determining multiple idiotypic determinants.

The osteogenic sarcomas were often multiple and appeared predominantly in the facial bones, less frequently in the ribs and vertebral column, and only rarely in the appendicular skeleton. Benign osteoblastic lesions were often observed adjacent to these sarcomas. Both the osteoblastic cells in the facial skeleton and Schwann cells are regarded as neural crest derivatives.

13667,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily attacks synovial joints. Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment of RA, novel molecular targets are still needed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and the therapeutic outcomes. Here, we present a systems approach that can effectively 1) identify core RA-associated genes (RAGs), 2) reconstruct RA-perturbed networks, and 3) select potential targets for diagnosis and treatments of RA. By integrating multiple gene expression datasets previously reported, we first identified 983 core RAGs that show RA dominant differential expression, compared to osteoarthritis (OA), in the multiple datasets. Using the core RAGs, we then reconstructed RA-perturbed networks that delineate key RA associated cellular processes and transcriptional regulation. The networks revealed that synovial fibroblasts play major roles in defining RA-perturbed processes, anti-TNF-α therapy restored many RA-perturbed processes, and 19 transcription factors (TFs) have major contribution to deregulation of the core RAGs in the RA-perturbed networks. Finally, we selected a list of potential molecular targets that can act as metrics or modulators of the RA-perturbed networks. Therefore, these network models identify a panel of potential targets that will serve as an important resource for the discovery of therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers, as well as providing novel insights into RA pathogenesis.",Sungyong You and Chul-Soo Cho and Inyoul Lee and Leroy Hood and Daehee Hwang and Wan-Uk Kim,28,4095556658105593245,PloS one,12,e51508,Public Library of Science,A systems approach to rheumatoid arthritis,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051508,7,2012,/scholar?cites=4095556658105593245,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:ifOnle78iJkC

13675,"The identification of DNA copy numbers from short-read sequencing data remains a challenge for both technical and algorithmic reasons. The raw data for these analyses are measured in tens to hundreds of gigabytes per genome; transmitting, storing and analyzing such large files is cumbersome, particularly for methods that analyze several samples simultaneously. We developed a very efficient representation of depth of coverage (150-1000x compression) that enables such analyses. Current methods for analyzing variants in whole-genome sequencing data frequently miss copy number variants (CNVs), particularly hemizygous deletions in the 1-100 kb range. To fill this gap, we developed a method to identify CNVs in individual genomes, based on comparison to joint profiles pre-computed from a large set of genomes. We analyzed depth of coverage in over 6000 high quality (>40x) genomes. The depth of coverage has strong sequence-specific fluctuations only partially explained by global parameters like %GC. To account for these fluctuations, we constructed multi-genome profiles representing the observed or inferred diploid depth of coverage at each position along the genome. These Reference Coverage Profiles (RCPs) take into account the diverse technologies and pipeline versions used. Normalization of the scaled coverage to the RCP followed by hidden Markov model (HMM) segmentation enables efficient detection of CNVs and large deletions in individual genomes. Use of pre-computed multi-genome coverage profiles improves our ability to analyze each individual genome.

13695,"The starting place for this book is the notion, current in the literature for around 30 years, that children could not learn their native language without substantial innate knowledge of its grammatical structure. It is argued that the notion is as problematic for contemporary theories of development as it was for theories of the past. Accepting this, the book attempts an in-depth study of the notions credibility. Central to the book's argument is the conclusion that the innateness hypothesis runs into two major problems. Firstly, its proponents are too ready to treat children as embryonic linguists, concerned with the representation of sentences as an end in itself. A more realistic approach would be to regard children as communication engineers, storing sentences to optimize the production and retrieval of meaning. Secondly, even when the communication analogy is adopted, it is glibly assumed that the meanings children impute will be the ones adults intend. One of the book's major contentions is that a careful reading of contemporary research suggests that the meanings may differ considerably. Identifying such problems, the book considers how development should proceed, given learning along communication lines and a more plausible analysis of meaning. It makes detailed predictions about what would be anticipated given no innate knowledge of grammar. Focusing on English but giving full acknowledgement to cross-linguistic research, it concludes that the predictions are consistent with both the known timescale of learning and the established facts about children's knowledge.

13715,"Deep sequencing of transcriptomes has become an indispensable tool for biology, enabling expression levels for thousands of genes to be compared across multiple samples. Since transcript counts scale with sequencing depth, counts from different samples must be normalized to a common scale prior to comparison. We analyzed fifteen existing and novel algorithms for normalizing transcript counts, and evaluated the effectiveness of the resulting normalizations. For this purpose we defined two novel and mutually independent metrics: (1) the number of “uniform” genes (genes whose normalized expression levels have a sufficiently low coefficient of variation), and (2) low Spearman correlation between normalized expression profiles of gene pairs. We also define four novel algorithms, one of which explicitly maximizes the number of uniform genes, and compared the performance of all fifteen algorithms. The two most commonly used methods (scaling to a fixed total value, or equalizing the expression of certain ‘housekeeping’ genes) yielded particularly poor results, surpassed even by normalization based on randomly selected gene sets. Conversely, seven of the algorithms approached what appears to be optimal normalization. Three of these algorithms rely on the identification of “ubiquitous” genes: genes expressed in all the samples studied, but never at very high or very low levels. We demonstrate that these include a “core” of genes expressed in many tissues in a mutually consistent pattern, which is suitable for use as an internal normalization guide.

13758,"We have determined the DNA sequence of a BALB/cTla region class I gene from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that had been identified previously as encoding a murine antigen by DNA-mediated gene transfer. Analysis of the DNA sequence shows, however, that this gene, the T1c gene from theTla c genotype, could not encode a TL antigen or any other functional class I molecule due to the presence of numerous stop codons and frameshift mutations in the coding regions.

These signatures were based on a new method reported herein – Identification of Structured Signatures and Classifiers (ISSAC) – that resulted in a brain cancer marker panel of 44 unique genes. Many of these genes have established relevance to the brain cancers examined herein, with others having known roles in cancer biology. Analyses on large-scale data from multiple sources must deal with significant challenges associated with heterogeneity between different published studies, for it was observed that the variation among individual studies often had a larger effect on the transcriptome than did phenotype differences, as is typical. For this reason, we restricted ourselves to studying only cases where we had at least two independent studies performed for each phenotype, and also reprocessed all the raw data from the studies using a unified pre-processing pipeline. We found that learning signatures across multiple datasets greatly enhanced reproducibility and accuracy in predictive performance on truly independent validation sets, even when keeping the size of the training set the same.

The genes involved in this translocation have been identified to be API2 on chromosome 11, which encodes an apoptotic inhibitor, and MALT1, a novel gene on chromosome 18. We identified the t(11;18)(q21;q21) by Southern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase PCR in 42% of a panel of extranodal MALT lymphomas. We also identified the breakpoints within the API2 and MALT1 genes in 7 patients, which revealed a consistent breakpoint after the third baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat domain within API2, and variable breakpoints in MALT1.

13788,"The multigene family is a unit of chromosomal organization. Its gene members are closely linked, homologous in sequence, and have overlapping functions. Multigene families can be divided into three categories-simple-sequence, multiplicational, and information-by a variety of structural and functional criteria. Multigene families exhibit two novel evolutionary features-coincidental evolution and rapid change in family size-that suggest that they all share one or more evolutionary mechanisms. Natural selection cannot act directly on individual genes in a family because of their identical or overlapping functions; hence selection must operate on the family as a whole or on blocks of genes within the family. The mechanism (s) for coincidental evolution expand out variant genes within a family so they can be acted on by natural selection, and accordingly, permit multigene families to evolve adaptively. The close linkage of the genes in a family appears to be a consequence of the fact that their ocntrol and evolutionary mechanisms may only operate on tandemly linked genes. New multigene families may evolve from a single gene or from other multigene families. In addition to evolving new functions, the latter mode of evolution generate a new multigene family whose members are preadapted to interact with those of the old family. These family interactions can lead to the evolution of more sophisticated molecular machines or to the regulation of one family by the second. Multigene families may be large or small.

Such ‘background’ sequences are generally taken from regions of the genome presumed to be intergenic, or generated synthetically by ‘shuffling’ real sequences. This last method can lead to underestimation of false-positive rates. We developed a new method for generating artificial sequences that are modeled after real intergenic sequences in terms of composition, complexity and interspersed repeat content.

13813,"The runt domain transcription factors are key regulators of developmental processes in bilaterians, involved both in cell proliferation and differentiation, and their disruption usually leads to disease. Three runt domain genes have been described in each vertebrate genome (the RUNX gene family), but only one in other chordates. Therefore, the common ancestor of vertebrates has been thought to have had a single runt domain gene. Analysis of the genome draft of the fugu pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) reveals the existence of a fourth runt domain gene, FrRUNT, in addition to the orthologs of human RUNX1, RUNX2 and RUNX3. The tiny FrRUNT packs six exons and two putative promoters in just 3 kb of genomic sequence. The first exon is located within an intron of FrSUPT3H, the ortholog of human SUPT3H, and the first exon of FrSUPT3H resides within the first intron of FrRUNT. The two gene structures are therefore ""interlocked"". In the human genome, SUPT3H is instead interlocked with RUNX2. FrRUNT has no detectable ortholog in the genomes of mammals, birds or amphibians. We consider alternative explanations for an apparent contradiction between the phylogenetic data and the comparison of the genomic neighborhoods of human and fugu runt domain genes. We hypothesize that an ancient RUNT locus was lost in the tetrapod lineage, together with FrFSTL6, a member of a novel family of follistatin-like genes. Our results suggest that the runt domain family may have started expanding in chordates much earlier than previously thought, and exemplify the importance of detailed analysis of whole-genome draft sequence to provide new …",Gustavo Glusman and Amardeep Kaur and Leroy Hood and Lee Rowen,17,1235889609927887932,BMC evolutionary biology,1,1-15,BioMed Central,An enigmatic fourth runt domain gene in the fugu genome: ancestral gene loss versus accelerated evolution,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-4-43,4,2004,/scholar?cites=1235889609927887932,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:Og1tA8FjbJAC
13814,"Production of fertilized oocytes and generation of transgenic mice is generally more efficient using F2 hybrid embryos than embryos from inbred mice. Most F2 hybrids are of the C57BL/6 background because of its genetic and embryologic features. However, our goal of developing a transgenic mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis necessitated using a susceptible mouse strain such as DBA/1. We prepared alpha and beta T-cell receptor (TCR) chain gene constructs and microinjected them into embryos from DBA/1, SWR,(DBA/1 x SWR) F1, and (SWR x DBA/1) F1 strains. We found SWR female mice to be prolific ovulators in response to exogenous hormones, with oocyte numbers comparable to those produced by (C57BL/6 x C3H) F1 female mice. Embryos from the (SWR x DBA/1) F1 or SWR strain were large and had prominent pronuclei, whereas (DBA/1 x SWR) F1 embryos were smaller and had less visible pronuclei, similar to those of DBA/1 embryos. Therefore, the pronuclear size and visibility are features of the SWR female mice and are independent of the genotype of the fertilizing spermatozoa. Resistance to lysis after co-injection of alpha beta TCR constructs and the efficiency of generating DNA-positive founders were comparable in SWR,(SWR x DBA/1) F1, and (C57BL6 x C3H) F2 embryos. Thus, the SWR mouse is another inbred strain, in addition to the FVB inbred strain, found to be highly suitable for propagation of transgenes. Furthermore, the SWR mouse is well defined genetically, and SWR females have a high ovulation rate, comparable to that of F1 hybrid mice.",Gamal E Osman and David P Jacobson and Sarah-Wenqin Li and Leroy E Hood and H Denny Liggitt and Warren C Ladiges,17,5012280983103034501,Laboratory animal science,2,167-171,,SWR: an inbred strain suitable for generating transgenic mice.,https://europepmc.org/article/med/9150496,47,1997,/scholar?cites=5012280983103034501,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:G1UMdFYMoxkC

However, emerging technologies for mapping and sequencing could change the picture dramatically. For example, sequencing, which is now done by hand, costs about $1 per base, making the total cost for se-quencing the human genome $6 billion (both DNA strands would need to be sequenced).

Studies in the murine system have shown that the expression of these genes in lymphocytes involves a number of genetic processes, including DNA rearrangements, alternative patterns of RNA splicing, and somatic mutation, all of which serve to amplify the information encoded in the germ line. The cloning of mouse Ig genes has been facilitated by the availability of inducible myeloma tumors, which produce large quantities of homogeneous immunoglobulins (Potter, 1972).

13843,"Modifiers of Mendelian disorders can provide insights into disease mechanisms and guide therapeutic strategies. A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study discovered genetic modifiers of Huntington's disease (HD) onset in Europeans. Here, we performed whole genome sequencing and GWA analysis of a Venezuelan HD cluster whose families were crucial for the original mapping of the HD gene defect. The Venezuelan HD subjects develop motor symptoms earlier than their European counterparts, implying the potential for population-specific modifiers. The main Venezuelan HD family inherits HTT haplotype hap.03, which differs subtly at the sequence level from European HD hap.03, suggesting a different ancestral origin but not explaining the earlier age at onset in these Venezuelans. GWA analysis of the Venezuelan HD cluster suggests both population-specific and population-shared genetic modifiers. Genome-wide significant signals at 7p21.2–21.1 and suggestive association signals at 4p14 and 17q21.2 are evident only in Venezuelan HD, but genome-wide significant association signals at the established European chromosome 15 modifier locus are improved when Venezuelan HD data are included in the meta-analysis.

13850,"Current methods for high resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) of proteins are capable of separating over 5000 protein spots in one procedure. Running and analysing such 2DE gels requires skilled technical work. However, the variable reproducibility of spot positions means that, even under the best circumstances, one gel cannot be overlain directly on another for precise comparison. Therefore, new and improved technologies that enhance gel-to-gel reproducibility are required. To this end, we have designed and built a research instrument to test whether a precise mechanical device could improve the gel-to-gel reproducibility by reducing the amount of distortion and positional variation between the first and second dimension gels. Other causes of poor reproducibility, including sample type and preparation, gel matrices and running conditions were not varied in order to limit this study to the mechanical variations inherent in current 2DE systems. We found that the sample standard deviation of pooled data for measured protein spot-to-spot distances in the prototype device was 1.3 mm as compared to 4.3 mm in a conventional 2DE system. These improvements support the possibility that greater automation of the multistep 2DE process will enhance reproducibility.

The molecular signals that identify a polypeptide for phosphatidylinositol (PI) attachment have not been well defined in any system, but are thought to reside in the C-terminus of the primary translation product. We report that all the signals responsible for PI anchoring of Qa-2 Ag are confined to the 36 C-terminal residues of the precursor proteins. To investigate further the features that signal cleavage and PI addition, we have studied mutants of two closely related murine class I MHC molecules: the PI-linked Ag, Q9b, from the Qa-2 Ag family, and the integral membrane transplantation antigen, H-2Ld.

13881,"We present an ultrafast method for comparing personal genomes. We transform the standard genome representation (lists of variants relative to a reference) into 'genome fingerprints' via locality sensitive hashing. The resulting genome fingerprints can be meaningfully compared even when the input data were obtained using different sequencing technologies, processed using different pipelines, represented in different data formats and relative to different reference versions. Furthermore, genome fingerprints are robust to up to 30% missing data. Because of their reduced size, computation on the genome fingerprints is fast and requires little memory. For example, we could compute all-against-all pairwise comparisons among the 2504 genomes in the 1000 Genomes data set in 67 seconds at high quality (21 microseconds per comparison, on a single processor), and achieved a lower quality approximation in just 11 seconds. Efficient computation enables scaling up a variety of important genome analyses, including quantifying relatedness, recognizing duplicative sequenced genomes in a set, population reconstruction, and many others. The original genome representation cannot be reconstructed from its fingerprint, effectively decoupling genome comparison from genome interpretation; the method thus has significant implications for privacy-preserving genome analytics.",Gustavo Glusman and Denise E Mauldin and Leroy E Hood and Max Robinson,12,4707340954246097839,Frontiers in genetics,,136,Frontiers,Ultrafast comparison of personal genomes via precomputed genome fingerprints,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2017.00136/full,8,2017,/scholar?cites=4707340954246097839,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:cDbf6tmpeSoC

The relative contributions of T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ gene segment polymorphisms, duplications, deletions, and gene conversions to this final T cell receptor protein diversity are unknown. To study these mechanisms, we sequenced and compared closely related primate TCR gene segments from BV8S1, S2, and S5. Interspecies comparisons show that these gene segments have sustained multiple duplication, gene conversion, and deletion events during the last 35 million years of anthropoid primate evolution.

In the first phase of the study, a dose range of 0.01-500 MU/m2 (0.0002-25 mg/m2) was tested and we found the maximum tolerated dose to be 400 MU/m2; the dose-limiting toxicity with this preparation was hypotension. In the second phase, three different schedules of administration were tested. There were no significant differences in toxicity between a 20 min, a 4 h, or a 24 h infusion of 60 MU/m2 (3 mg/m2). In the third phase, patients received chronic administration of either 1 or 30 MU/m2.

No significant changes were seen in natural killer cell activity, antibody-dependent complement cytotoxicity, or monocyte cytotoxicity at any dose. Maximal stimulation of 2', 5'-oligodenylate synthetase occurred at low doses (12 MU/m2). Depressed bone marrow colony formation for CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM in vivo was noted. No objective antitumor responses were noted. This preparation of recombinant interferon-gamma can be given in doses as high as 400 MU/m2.

Asymmetric PCR provides a reliable means of simultaneously producing sufficient and uniform quantities of several template DNAs directly from bacterial colonies or bacteriophage plaques.

How is it that the two classes of lymphocytes, T cells with their T-cell receptors and B cells with their immunoglobulins, have the capacity to interact with virtually the entire universe of macromolecular determinants? Two distinct mechanisms have played an important role in generating the diversity in these lymphocyte antigen receptors. First, evolutionary diversification has resulted in the formation of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, which contains a variety of multigene families and single genes that include most of the receptors for the vertebrate immune response (Hood et al. 1985)(Fig. 1). Thus, the duplication of exons creating more complex genes and the duplication of genes themselves resulting in the formation of large gene families with a multiplicity of discrete gene segments provide the initial repertoire from …",P Concannon and E Lai and M Klein and S Siu and E Strauss and L Pickering and P Kung and R Gatti and L Hood,9,1274535594075182255,Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology,,785-795,Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press,"Human T-cell receptor genes: organization, diversity, and polymorphism",http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/51/785.short,51,1986,/scholar?cites=1274535594075182255,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:qmtmRrLr0tkC

13958,"Systems biology offers a holistic approach to deciphering physiology or disease by deriving and integrating biological information to delineate relevant networks and their dynamics. It enables medicine that is predictive, preventive, personalized, and participatory, with a focus on the two primary domains of health care—wellness and disease—using “deep phenotyping” to decipher the complexities of human health. This approach is defined by the longitudinal aggregation of high-throughput information on individuals, including digital health data; clinical laboratory tests; omics data that are based on the genome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome, and exposome; and the deployment of mathematical and statistical models for interrogation of biological networks. The integration of these data enables (i) the identification of actionable possibilities to improve individual health,(ii) personalized diagnostics to identify the earliest transitions from wellness to disease, and (iii) the ability to reverse pathophysiological changes before disease manifests using system-driven preventive measures. This strategy, including deep phenotyping of individuals coupled with data-informed actions to improve health and avoid or mitigate disease trajectories, is defined as “scientific wellness”(1).

Recent developments will permit a reduction in cost and time expenditure for such analyses. We describe a method, the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA), that used alone or in conjunction with target ampliﬁcation by PCR permits the rapid and standardized identiﬁcation of closely related DNA sequences. A majority of the sequence differences between homologous DNA segments in different individuals is limited to single nucleotide positions. Among 40 genes investigated for structural aberrations leading to human genetic disease, most of the sequence variants involved the substitution of one nucleotide for another (McKusick 1988). Likewise, a majority of sequence variations serving as markers for genetic linkage analysis are the consequence of point mutations, predominantly affecting noncoding areas of the genome (Kimura 1983). Therefore, an important requirement of a general gene detection technique is that differences in single-nucleotide positions may be readily detected.

It plays host to a variety of small molecules, from metabolites (compounds involved in metabolic reactions) to cell-free DNA and RNA. It also contains a diverse set of proteins arising from virtually every intersecting organ—by secretion, apoptosis, or enzymatic cleavage from cell membranes—that can serve as sensors for the state of their cognate organs. Accordingly, blood is a valuable window into health and disease. Thus, deconvoluting the blood proteome provides unique opportunities for understanding the physiological and pathological states of an …",James T Yurkovich and Leroy Hood,6,340595274611811926,Clinical chemistry,10,1204-1206,Oxford University Press,Blood is a window into health and disease,https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article-abstract/65/10/1204/5608266,65,2019,/scholar?cites=340595274611811926,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:aryKp6_dckwC

13991,"Phosphorescent zinc sulfide is a nonradioactive alternative for making orientation and identification markings on autoradiograms. Measurements with a luminometer show that light emission is linear with respect to ZnS concentration. A minimum activation time of 5 s has been determined, using an incandescent lamp as a light source. Emission decay kinetics show light emissions reached background levels within minutes, depending on the ZnS concentration. This time period is sufficient for X-ray films to be permanently marked. Because of its efficiency and nontoxicity, this autoradiogram marker could be extremely useful in many protocols, including high-throughput radioactive DNA sequencing. This nonradioactive marker will also be useful in protocols utilizing nonradioactive detection systems, such as those calling for biotinylated and chemiluminescent probes.",Donald Seto and Cliff Rohrabacher and Jason Seto and Leroy Hood,6,13270703124545961515,Analytical biochemistry,1,51-53,Academic Press,Phosphorescent zinc sulfide is a nonradioactive alternative for marking autoradiograms,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003269790900428,189,1990,/scholar?cites=13270703124545961515,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:QoJ_w57xiyAC
13992,"Polyethers are classified into biodegradable synthetic polymers. Among them, polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are most widely used as commodity chemicals in various industrial fields. Consequently, biodegradability studies have been primarily focused on PEGs. PEGs are aerobically or anaerobically metabolized by various bacteria. Biochemical routes have also been studied for aerobic degradation of the compound. On the other hand, bacterial degradation of polypropylene glycol and its metabolic route is suggested. Another polyether, polytetramethylene glycol, is also utilized by aerobic bacteria as the sole carbon and energy source.",Fusako Kawai,6,8791474803727981688,,,110-123,,Biodegradation of polyethers,https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/bk-1990-0433.ch010,,1990,/scholar?cites=8791474803727981688,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:X5YyAB84Iw4C
13993,"The introduction of cloned genes into cells has greatly increased our knowledge of the factors that regulate the transcription of these genes and of the function of the proteins that they encode. Recently, techniques have been developed that allow the incorporation of cloned genes into the germline of mice (Gordon et al., 1980 9; Brinster et al., 1981 3; Costantini and Lacy, 1981 7). The generation of such transgenic animals has advanced our understanding of the elements involved in regulating tissue specificity and developmental expression of the incorporated genes. Additionally, these studies have yielded insight into the involvement of the transgenes in the physiology of the animal (Palmiter and Brinster, 1986 24). The application of this technique to genes of neurobiological interest can provide insights into the role specific genes play in the organization and function of the mammalian nervous system.

13999,"THE precursor forms of prokaryote 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are larger than their mature counterparts by some 10%(refs 1–5). An analogous large precursor form of the bacterial 5S RNA exists (in at least some cases) 1, 3, 6, 7. The reason for the existence of these rRNA precursor forms is not known. They could merely reflect an aspect of the transcription process, or they could have evolved specifically to facilitate ribosome assembly. A more intriguing possibility is that they represent vestiges of ancestral rRNAs, retained because they are essential to ribosome assembly—which process must reasonably recapitulate, to some extent, ribosomal evolution. This last alternative gains some support from our discovery of a stable form of the 5S RNA some 30–40% larger than normal, in Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum.",LA Sutton and CR Woese,6,16151042351547467820,Nature,5512,64-66,Nature Publishing Group,Stable large variant of 5S RNA in Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum,https://www.nature.com/articles/256064a0,256,1975,/scholar?cites=16151042351547467820,TQ8RcVgAAAAJ:A7-hzOuI2KQC
