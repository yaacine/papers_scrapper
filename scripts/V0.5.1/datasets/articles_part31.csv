31000,The origin of living Homo sapiens has once again been the subject of much debate. Genetic data on present human population relationships and data from the Pleistocene fossil hominid record are used to compare two contrasting models for the origin of modern humans. Both genetics and paleontology support a recent African origin for modern humans rather than a long period of multiregional evolution accompanied by gene flow.,Chris B Stringer and Peter Andrews,1301,1890913100614665906,Science,4845,1263-1268,American Association for the Advancement of Science,Genetic and fossil evidence for the origin of modern humans,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/239/4845/1263.abstract,239,1988,/scholar?cites=1890913100614665906,DYH72nQAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C
31001,"Ever since the first discovery of their bones, the Neanderthals have provoked controversy. Who were they? How were they related to modern people? What caused their disappearance 35,000 years ago? The Neanderthals have become the archetype of all that is primitive. But what is their true story? Today Neanderthal specialists are locked in one of the fiercest debates in modern science. One side, the ""multiregional"" school, argues that the Neanderthals and their contemporaries evolved semi-independently into modern humans. Christopher Stringer leads the ""out of Africa"" school, which believes that the Neanderthals were replaced by modern people from Africa. Here he sets out his views for the first time, with the archaeologist Clive Gamble. Step by step the authors put forward their case. The Neanderthals had an anatomy crucially different from our own, adapted to Ice Age Europe. Neanderthal behaviour similarly points to fundamental differences. New genetic evidence strongly suggests a single origin for modern humans in Africa. The authors argue that, capable and intelligent as the Neanderthals were, they proved no match for the better-organized, better-equipped newcomers, and died out.",Christopher Stringer and Clive Gamble,939,9028179411308362967,,,,Thames and Hudson,In search of the Neanderthals: solving the puzzle of human origins,https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/391482,,1993,/scholar?cites=9028179411308362967,DYH72nQAAAAJ:LK8CI43ZvvMC
31002,"INTRODUCTION In 1976 WW Howells reviewed the evidence concerning the origin or origins of modern populations, and used the description'Noah's Ark'hypothesis for one possible explanation-the contention that all living populations have a single recent origin from a source population that was already modern. In developing this hypothesis Howells proposed that once these modern populations appeared, they spread rapidly and replaced indigenous populations over the inhabited world. The'Noah's Ark'hypothesis is not a classic punctuational scheme; the modem populations may not be a different species according to Howells' interpretation, and the population c1ivergence may not have been at the ecological or geographic periphery of the human range, as the punctuational model requires. Howells suggested'Noah's Ark'as one of several possibilities for the explanation of modern population origins, and was unsure as to which was correct. In the past ten years, interpretations of Dew genetic evidence have been brought forward to modify the'Noah's Ark'hypothesis into a much more focused statement of a rapid punctuational event at the origin of modern Homo sapiens. The interpretations of several different lines of genetic evidence are said to combine to suggest rhat modern populations originated within the last 200 000 years, all descencling from a common mother who lived in Africa and gave rise to a small population of a new species (cf. Stringer and Andrews 1988) with severely reduced genetic variability in their mitochondrial ON A (mt ON A).

31003,"The question of the mode of origin of modern humans (Homo sapiens) has dominated palaeoanthropological debate over the last decade. This review discusses the main models proposed to explain modern human origins, and examines relevant fossil evidence from Eurasia, Africa and Australasia. Archaeological and genetic data are also discussed, as well as problems with the concept of ‘modernity’ itself.

Ornaments such as shell beads represent some of the earliest objects of this kind. We report on examples of perforated Nassarius gibbosulus shell beads from Grotte des Pigeons (Taforalt, Morocco), North Africa. These marine shells come from archaeological levels dated by luminescence and uranium-series techniques to ≈82,000 years ago. They confirm evidence of similar ornaments from other less well dated sites in North Africa and adjacent areas of southwest Asia. The shells are of the same genus as shell beads from slightly younger levels at Blombos Cave in South Africa.

Our genes betray this secret of common racial heritage; further, the apparent racial distinctions of modern humans that have given rise to centuries of prejudice and inequality are shown to be merely geographical variants. Drawing on impressive fossil and genetic evidence and writing in an exceptionally readable style, Christopher Stringer, the primary architect of the Out of Africa model, and science writer Robin McKie challenge a long-held assumption that our species evolved separately as different races with ancient genetic roots, reaching back two million years. Instead, the authors go beyond the incomplete fossil record to the nuclear genome,"" from the bones of the dead to the blood of the living,"" to tell the dramatic story of how our species thrived while others, including Neanderthals, died out. They argue persuasively that though modern humans may not always look alike, our biological constitutions are unvarying: An Eskimo and an Australian aborigine, a Chinese and a Swede-people worlds apart-are more alike than two gorillas from the same forest.

This paper presents one such case study: Niah Cave in Sarawak on the island of Borneo, famous for the discovery in 1958 in the West Mouth of the Great Cave of a modern human skull, the ‘Deep Skull,’ controversially associated with radiocarbon dates of ca. 40,000 years before the present.

31010,"Remarkable changes have been seen recently in our perceptions about the origin and early evolution of anatomically modern Homo supiens (hereafter Homo sapiens or modern humans). Some of this change is the result of new approaches to the study of the palaeontological record, some to fossil discoveries, some to new genetic research on modern samples, and some to the development and application of dating techniques. These can for the first time cover the critical time zone of the later middle and early late Pleistocene where radiocarbon dating is inapplicable or of dubious value. This review examines the role of electron spin resonance (ESR) dating of tooth enamel, which, together with the related technique of thermoluminescence (TL) dating of burnt flint, has made the greatest single impact on chronologies. These techniques have demonstrated that the extensive early modern skeletal sample from Qafzeh Cave (Israel) is apparently; at about 90 to 120 ka, more than twice as old as many workers expected. The clear implication of these determinations is that Neanderthals and early modern humans were indeed separate and parallel evolutionary lineages, rather than ancestors and descendants. The repercussions of these results are still being felt. However, the age estimates are not yet universally accepted, with intimations that the dates cannot be verified independently and might be inaccurate (Trinkaus, in Bower 1988), are ‘still experimental’(Trinkaus 1991) or might ‘not stand the test of time’(Wolpoff 1989a, 104).In this review of ESR dating and recent human evolution, we introduce the ESR technique and discuss its particular …",Rainer Grün and Christopher B Stringer,391,18416306360593119456,Archaeometry,2,153-199,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,Electron spin resonance dating and the evolution of modern humans,http://in-africa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Grun-R-Stringer-1991-Archaeometry-ESR_AMH-origins.pdf,33,1991,/scholar?cites=18416306360593119456,DYH72nQAAAAJ:tYavs44e6CUC

Second, the evidence was relatively complete and well dated by"" reference to a framework of glacial chronology, biostratigraphic sequences, and archeological succes-sions.

Are modern humans a distinct species from ancient people such as the Neanderthals? And what contact did our ancestors have with them? How can we recognise modern humans behaviourally, and were traits such as complex language and art unique to modern humans? What forces shaped the origins of modern humans-were they climatic, dietary, social, or even volcanic? What drove the dispersals of modern humans from Africa, and how did our species spread over the globe? How did regional features evolve, and how significant are they?

Three scientists--Joseph Weiner, Kenneth Oakley, and Wilfrid Le Gros Clark--described their investigations into the important fossilized human remains found at Piltdown in Sussex in the early 1900s. Their conclusion was stunning: the remains, and the accompanying materials that supposedly verified them as ancient fossils, had all been faked. The discovery of Piltdown Man had been announced to the world in 1912 by an amateur fossil hunter, Charles Dawson, and the Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum in London, Arthur Smith Woodward, who had found fragments of a thickset skull and an ape-like lower jaw, along with other bones and stone tools. These fragments pointed to a species of early human who had lived in England a million years ago-a'missing link'between apes and modern man. But, as Weiner and his colleagues wereto reveal in 1953, the skull was a recent one, and the jaw had belonged to an orang-utan. These and many other'finds' from Piltdown had been deliberately stained and tampered with to make them appear ancient, and the scientific establishment had been well and truly fooled. Widely praised from its first publication in 1955, The Piltdown Forgery remains the classic account of this story and its many players.

31065,"Investigations at Happisburgh, UK, have revealed the oldest known hominin footprint surface outside Africa at between ca. 1 million and 0.78 million years ago. The site has long been recognised for the preservation of sediments containing Early Pleistocene fauna and flora, but since 2005 has also yielded humanly made flint artefacts, extending the record of human occupation of northern Europe by at least 350,000 years. The sediments consist of sands, gravels and laminated silts laid down by a large river within the upper reaches of its estuary. In May 2013 extensive areas of the laminated sediments were exposed on the foreshore. On the surface of one of the laminated silt horizons a series of hollows was revealed in an area of ca. 12 m2. The surface was recorded using multi-image photogrammetry which showed that the hollows are distinctly elongated and the majority fall within the range of juvenile to adult hominin foot sizes. In many cases the arch and front/back of the foot can be identified and in one case the impression of toes can be seen. Using foot length to stature ratios, the hominins are estimated to have been between ca. 0.93 and 1.73 m in height, suggestive of a group of mixed ages. The orientation of the prints indicates movement in a southerly direction on mud-flats along the river edge.

At the same time, human remains from this time period are scarce in Africa, and even rarer in West Africa. The Iwo Eleru burial is one of the few human skeletal remains associated with Later Stone Age artifacts in that region with a proposed Pleistocene date. We undertook a morphometric reanalysis of this cranium in order to better assess its affinities. We also conducted Uranium-series dating to re-evaluate its chronology.   Methodology/Principal Findings A 3-D geometric morphometric analysis of cranial landmarks and semilandmarks was conducted using a large comparative fossil and modern human sample. The measurements were collected in the form of three dimensional coordinates and processed using Generalized Procrustes Analysis. Principal components, canonical variates, Mahalanobis D2 and Procrustes distance analyses were performed. The results were further visualized by comparing specimen and mean configurations. Results point to a morphological similarity with late archaic African specimens dating to the Late Pleistocene. A long bone cortical fragment was made available for U-series analysis in order to re-date the specimen. The results (∼11.7–16.3 ka) support a terminal Pleistocene chronology for the Iwo Eleru burial as was also suggested by the original radiocarbon dating results and by stratigraphic evidence.

31102,"Background The use of human braincases as drinking cups and containers has extensive historic and ethnographic documentation, but archaeological examples are extremely rare. In the Upper Palaeolithic of western Europe, cut-marked and broken human bones are widespread in the Magdalenian (∼15 to 12,000 years BP) and skull-cup preparation is an element of this tradition.   Principal Findings Here we describe the post-mortem processing of human heads at the Upper Palaeolithic site of Gough's Cave (Somerset, England) and identify a range of modifications associated with the production of skull-cups. New analyses of human remains from Gough's Cave demonstrate the skilled post-mortem manipulation of human bodies. Results of the research suggest the processing of cadavers for the consumption of body tissues (bone marrow), accompanied by meticulous shaping of cranial vaults. The distribution of cut-marks and percussion features indicates that the skulls were scrupulously 'cleaned' of any soft tissues, and subsequently modified by controlled removal of the facial region and breakage of the cranial base along a sub-horizontal plane. The vaults were also ‘retouched’, possibly to make the broken edges more regular. This manipulation suggests the shaping of skulls to produce skull-cups.   Conclusions Three skull-cups have been identified amongst the human bones from Gough's Cave. New ultrafiltered radiocarbon determinations provide direct dates of about 14,700 cal BP, making these the oldest directly dated skull-cups and the only examples known from the British Isles.",Silvia M Bello and Simon A Parfitt and Chris B Stringer,84,9049765169217078915,PLoS One,2,e17026,Public Library of Science,Earliest directly-dated human skull-cups,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017026,6,2011,/scholar?cites=9049765169217078915,DYH72nQAAAAJ:g5m5HwL7SMYC

31114,"The study of modern human origins is marked by fundamental disagreements about the best methods for recognizing and analyzing the variation among fossil samples. Distinguishing intraspecific from interspecific variation is crucial for classifying Pleistocene Homo. Four recent proposals relevant to understanding modern human origins are discussed: that recognition of only three species of the genus Homo underestimates the true number of species; that Homo erectus should be sunk into Homo sapiens; that all Middle Paleolithic human fossils from the Levant represent variants of a single population; that the Skhul-Qafzeh samples are highly variable and have been mischaracterized as"" modern."" The most reasonable division of middle and later Pleistocene Homo is into at least four species: H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis, H. sapiens, and a common ancestor to H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis. This fourth species may be referred to as H. heidelbergensis, H. rhodesiensis, orH. helmei, depending on its precise composition.The recent ferment in the study of modern human origins has led to an unprecedented burst of scientific activity in the form of fieldwork and research, in debate, both in the scientific and popular media, and in a reexamination of fundamentals in the subject.
