10000,"Are trust and risk important in consumers' electronic commerce purchasing decisions? What are the antecedents of trust and risk in this context? How do trust and risk affect an Internet consumer's purchasing decision? To answer these questions, we i) develop a theoretical framework describing the trust-based decision-making process a consumer uses when making a purchase from a given site, ii) test the proposed model using a Structural Equation Modeling technique on Internet consumer purchasing behavior data collected via a Web survey, and iii) consider the implications of the model. The results of the study show that Internet consumers' trust and perceived risk have strong impacts on their purchasing decisions.

10001,"Journal of Marketing Research, about a then-revolutionary phenomenon:“... over 90% of those surveyed stated that the major attraction of telephone shopping is its convenience...”[5]. The phenomenon of the Internet shopping today is very much akin to telephone shopping when this comment was originally made. Given that the Internet as a commercial vehicle is a relatively new concept, there is bound to be much uncertainty regarding the value of services it provides. The consumer makes his choices under conditions of uncertainty and therefore maximizes his or her expected benefit. 1 A large number of papers in marketing deal with decisionmaking under conditions of uncertainty [7, 10]. An underlying construct of our approach is that different individuals would have different levels of risk acceptance (or aversion).

Our study is informed by the literature on IS adoption, protection-motivation theory, deterrence theory, and organisational behaviour, and is motivated by the fundamental premise that the adoption of information security practices and policies is affected by organisational, environmental, and behavioural factors.

10003,"Trust and satisfaction are essential ingredients for successful business relationships in business-to-consumer electronic commerce. Yet there is little research on trust and satisfaction in e-commerce that takes a longitudinal approach. Drawing on three primary bodies of literature, the theory of reasoned action, the extended valence framework, and expectation-confirmation theory, this study synthesizes a model of consumer trust and satisfaction in the context of e-commerce. The model considers not only how consumers formulate their prepurchase decisions, but also how they form their long-term relationships with the same website vendor by comparing their prepurchase expectations to their actual purchase outcome.

Although most organizations have long been using security technologies, it is well known that technology tools alone are not sufficient. Thus, the area of end-user security behaviors in organizations has gained an increased attention. In information security observing end-user security behaviors is challenging. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the end users have divergent security views. The inability to monitor employee IT security behaviors and divergent views regarding security policies, in our view, provide a setting where the principal agent paradigm applies.

It is elevating the online public community to the status of first responders who can collectively cope with social crises. However, at the same time, many warnings have been raised about the reliability of community intelligence obtained through social reporting by the amateur online community. Using rumor theory, this paper studies citizen-driven information processing through Twitter services using data from three social crises: the Mumbai terrorist attacks in 2008, the Toyota recall in 2010, and the Seattle café shooting incident in 2012.

Recently, the theory of incomplete contracts (IC)[2, 9] has emerged; it owes its intellectual roots to TCE but is more rigorous. This theory focuses on property rights and the issues that arise when contracts are incomplete.According to TCE and IC, there are several factors that determine the efficient governance mode: asset specificity, uncertainty, potential number of vendors, and frequency, among others. Williamson [24] argues that individuals have a limited informationprocessing capacity in an uncertain world amid opportunistic behavior.(Each individual discloses information in a selective and distorted manner for his or her own interest.

10026,"In the information society, it is important for firms to manage their core information resources securely. However, the difficulty of measuring the return on an IT security investment is one of the critical obstacles for firms in making such investment decisions. By utilizing event methodology, this study examines the value of an investment in IT security, based on stock market investors' behavior toward a firms' IT security investment announcements. Based on a sample of 101 investment announcements of firms whose stocks are publicly traded in the U.S. stock market between 1997 and 2006, we find substantial support for the hypotheses that information security investment leads to positive abnormal returns for firms. Interestingly, security investments with commercial exploitation tend to result in higher returns than those for IT security improvement.

However along with the adoption, there have been concerns about risky issues regarding privacy leakages and information sharing hazards. Such risks are partially due to the fact that seniors (knowingly or unknowingly) share private information that may be misused by others. In this paper we explore the privacy-preserving actions regarding information sharing for this demography on one social media platform — Facebook. Facebook is the largest social networking platform today and many of its privacy related practices have been in the news recently.

10103,"Successful disaster management requires efficient information sharing and coordination of multi-agency emergency response operations. This paper compares two types of multi-agency emergency response exercises where multiple relief agencies are required to collaborate, using a set of information communication technologies, in response to large-scale disaster scenarios. The analysis shows that many decision-makers and information managers suffer from a lack of information availability awareness and that the information flows are heavily regulated by the institutional structure and organizations involved in multi-agency emergency response, which may not achieve the full potential of the available ICTs’ technical capabilities. As a result, information systems should be conceptualized in a way that the system includes the underlying political and organizational structure, institutional rules/operational procedures, norms, and most importantly, the human actors.

The work of first responders was helped by micro-blogging services and crisis mapping systems that were deployed for rescue missions. These systems provided the capability to reshape the crisis response by facilitating collective response through citizen reports, visualization and interactive mapping by (1) enabling crisis information from the voluntary online public to be disseminated speedily,(2) offering new insights into events happening in near real-time, and (3) assisting humanitarian efforts related to community recovery from crises. In this research-in-progress paper, we focus on a participatory and collaborative crisis mapping system known as Ushahidi. We explore how the Ushahidi mapping system was utilized for collaboration in collective crisis response. Second, we suggest that two dimensions of the information quality framework are paramount in such crises: uncertainty reduction and urgency.

While such threats can significantly impact important factors for effective government operations such as citizens’ information demand and attitude toward the government, little is known about their potential effect on citizens’ acceptance of e-Government services. In order to fill this gap, this study examines the effects of perceived risks of terrorism and trustworthiness of the government, on citizens’ e-Government usage intentions. The data was collected through two surveys with a one-year interval: during and after the war in Iraq. The analysis revealed that citizens’ e-Government usage intentions can be significantly influenced by perceived risks of terrorism and trustworthiness of the supreme government, as well as other factors suggested by previous research. These relationships appear to vary depending on the domain and the type of the particular e-Government service.

Earlier studies on G2C service adoption have shown that private sector-oriented models can result in inconsistent findings when applied to different service types or circumstances. This paper argues that government-citizen relationships often go beyond underlying assumption of user acceptance models applied across different areas, and that a more generalizable model for various egovernment services is essential for understanding and improving citizens’e-government service acceptance.

Such preference information is obtained by the coordinator through an experimental process that entails interrogating each of the agents about their preference profiles.

10182,"The theory of questionnaires deals with the design of experiments for eliciting information with a view to making a decision. The need for eliciting information arises in the problem of allocation of discrete and indivisible scarce resources among consumers by a coordinator. Resource allocation is carried out based on consumer preference information about the discrete resources. This information is acquired by the coordinator by administering a questionnaire, a sequential experimental process that allows the mapping of consumer preference profiles. Questionnaires are comprised of paired comparison experiments.

10207,"The World Wide Web (WWW), as the platform for E-Commerce, is the breeding ground for innovative applications. It is also providing the impetus for development of newer building blocks of information systems (IS) platforms. Today, novel applications such as push-type delivery of information, television style channels, multimedia mail attachments, desktop video-conferencing, and other examples of electronic commerce exist on the web. None of these was in wide use even as late as 1996. How are these technologies different from host-based and client/server technologies? What is the impact, if any, of these technologies on the skills set that IS majors need to have? This paper attempts an answer to the above questions by adopting an adult learning framework. Using the framework, we trace the impact of technology changes on skill requirements and the curricula. An appreciation of the fundamental differences that separate host-based, client/server and web-based platforms and E-Commerce applications can help in understanding this impact.",Abhijit Chaudhury and Ho Raghav Rao,7,9885278020588069288,Journal of Information Systems Education,1-2,19,,E-commerce technologies and Information Systems Curricula,http://jise.org/Volume11/n1-2/JISEv11n1-2p19.html,11,2000,/scholar?cites=9885278020588069288,y1pwDooAAAAJ:_xSYboBqXhAC

10241,"The discrete resource allocation problem (RAP) examines the problem of allocation of discrete and indivisible scarce resources in a multiple agent environment from the point of view of a coordinator. The basis for resource allocation is preference information of each agent regarding the discrete resources. Such preference information is obtained by the coordinator through a sequential experimental process that entails interrogating each of the agents about their preference profiles. In this environment, where information is incomplete and has finite cost, two kinds of experimental schemes are investigated: one consists of pairwise comparisons between resource bundles about which there is incomplete a priori preference information, and the other consists of experiments that rank resource bundles about which there is incomplete a priori preference information.

10244,"The Zika Virus brought spread fear not only because of its direct impact on many lives but also due to the various cyber-rumor messages spread across social media (Valecha et al., 2017). It is not surprising that several medical societies, WHO, CDC, etc. have put in their best efforts in educating people about the situation. Due to the significant time taken by those organizations in providing factual information, there has been a widespread problem of rumors associated with health information. When health information is manipulated, it results in frustration, panic and disturbances among the lives of general people. It comes as no surprise that the Atlantic states,“of all the categories of [misinformation], health news is the worst.” 1The dark side of social media in the form of cyber-rumors has motivated many researchers in behavioral Information Systems to study the core nature of the message (Oh et al., 2018). A key element for successful health-related cyber-rumor management is “to understand what makes citizens prone to engaging in [health-related] cyber-rumor sharing”(Kwon & Rao, 2017; p. 307). Prior literature in the rumor context has investigated polarity of a rumor in a news channel (Oh et al., 2013). It has found that most of the rumors that spread in case of a disaster scenario possess negative sentiment. In this paper, we focus on another characteristic of the cyber-rumor message–distance from point of interest (Kwon et al., 2017).",Tejaswi Volety and Rohit Valecha and Naga Vemprala and Hazel Kwon and Raghav Rao,4,9535058929098325629,,,,,Cyber-rumor sharing: the case of Zika virus,https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2018/DataScience/Presentations/1/,,2018,/scholar?cites=9535058929098325629,y1pwDooAAAAJ:IfvCfoBprpQC
10245,"The purpose of this study is to methodologically replicate the model presented by D’Arcy et al.(2014) using a new sampling frame that consists of employees in a single organization–a large academic institution in Canada (N= 150). This is in contrast to the original study, which used a large, demographically diverse sample of online panel respondents that spanned multiple organizations and industries. Our replication results confirm the results of the original study, and in doing so, support the theoretical position that security-related stress induces moral disengagement of information security policy (ISP) violations, which in turn increases ISP violation intention. The findings also indirectly support the viability of online panel respondents for studies of employees’ security-related intentions. Having established the robustness of the D’Arcy et al.(2014) model across two sampling frames, we recommend future conceptual replications that employ alternate measures of security-related stress and more rigorous research designs that capture the relationships between security-related stress, moral disengagement, and ISP violations.",John D’Arcy and Tejaswini Herath and Myung-Seong Yim and N Kichan and HR Rao,4,12059155159776008251,AIS Transactions on Replication Research,8,1-17,,Employee moral disengagement in response to stressful information security requirements: a methodological replication of a coping-based model,https://aisel.aisnet.org/trr/vol4/iss1/8/,4,2018,/scholar?cites=12059155159776008251,y1pwDooAAAAJ:5-tCjTwfAdEC
10246,"The Protection Motivation Theory is a leading framework to study individuals’ information security behaviors such as identity theft protection, but the effects of its two components, namely threat appraisal and coping appraisal, vary across studies. This study examines the issue based on an integrated Protection Motivation-Precaution Adoption Process Model. We suggest that the effects of perceived threat (including perceived vulnerability and perceived severity) and perceived coping efficacy (including perceived response efficacy and self-efficacy) on individuals’ intentions to adopt identity protection service are influenced by the stage of the person in the behavioral change process: for individuals in the action stage, their intention is influenced more by perceived coping efficacy but less by perceived threat, compared to those in the pre-action stage. An online survey via Qualtrics Research Suite partially confirms our expectation.

10248,In this document we describe a theoretical approach to modeling public emotional response cycles to crisis events. We also provide a preliminary theoretical approach to modeling crisis communication propagation that is counter intuitive to existing belief and literature regarding emotionally charged language and discussion artifact dispersion. The data set used to test these theories is contextualized by the OPM data breach of 2015 and consists of twitter data corresponding to the ensuing discussion following public notification that the breach had occurred. The resulting analysis reveals that an adapted Kübler-Ross model fits the aggregated public emotional response cycle and that emotionally charged language is negatively associated with messages the disperse more than average.,Eric Bachura and Rohit Valecha and Rui Chen and Raghav H Rao,4,9029982497658979399,,,,,Modeling public response to data breaches,https://aisel.aisnet.org/amcis2017/InformationSystems/Presentations/43/,,2017,/scholar?cites=9029982497658979399,y1pwDooAAAAJ:GCDlZl827dEC
10249," Social Network Services (SNS), for example Twitter, play a significant role in the way people share their emotions about specific events. Emotions can spread via SNS and can spur people’s future actions. Therefore, during extreme events, disaster response agencies need to manage emotions appropriately via SNS. In this research, we investigate the Twitter verse associated with an event - the Boston Bombing context. We focus on tweets in the context of hazard-describing keywords (Explosion, Bomb), important event timelines, and the related changes in emotions over time. We compare the results with a corpus of tweets collected at the same time that are not associated with the above hazard- describing keywords. A sentiment analysis shows anger was the most strongly expressed emotion in both groups.

Among our findings: intermediaries find it optimal to offer registration fee incentives and derive revenues from transaction fees from successful matches; as switching costs increase, incumbent utilities increase and entrant utilities decrease; expertise, modeled as the ability of mediators to assess vendor attributes accurately, is a powerful competitive weapon for entrants to erode the incumbent intermediary's first mover advantage.

Two government compliance services in two different service domains were examined in a questionnaire survey that yielded 150 usable responses from current or prospective users of the services. The results suggest that citizens adopt different decision criteria for different types of e-Gov compliance services. More specifically, functional usefulness of an e-Gov service becomes a more important criterion when the compliance service involves difficult tasks. In contrast, if the task of compliance is simple, the e-Gov service provider's competence in online operations becomes a more important factor of potential users' decisions.

Emergency events such as natural disasters and manmade accidents are characterized by their rare occurrence and the high risk of negative consequences if decisions in response to the emergency are slow, uninformed, or inadequate (Ajenstat et al. 2007). As emergency management typically involves complex network of tasks, resources, and actors, coordination emerges as a critical management aspect which should be used to address the embedded interdependencies for smooth and efficient response operations (Turoff 2002).Coordination is a specific form of decision making wherein the problems associated with the different possible responses are interdependent (Malone 1994; Malone et al. 1990). Challenges ranging from limited information, unpredictable development, short time windows, and high risks all threaten the response organizations in their ability to make rapid and sound coordination decisions. The governmental reports of coordination in recent rare events, such as 9/11 attack and Hurricane Katrina, reveal enormous failures, calling for further research to improve coordination practices (Townsend 2006).",Rui Chen and Raj Sharman and H Raghav Rao and Shambhu J Upadhyaya and Catherine P Cook-Cottone,2,13741870724917856968,,,1-19,,Organizational Coordination in Extreme Events: A Case Study of October’06 Snowstorm in Western New York,http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.511.2598&rep=rep1&type=pdf,,2007,/scholar?cites=13741870724917856968,y1pwDooAAAAJ:lmc2jWPfTJgC

Each member of an enterprise information portal EIP) can undergo three distinct types of learning processes: learning-by-investment, learning-by-doing, and learning-from-others. Through these three types of learning processes, each member achieves specialized knowledge that is related to his or her own task. Cumulative knowledge resulting from the learning processes is considered in terms of two distinct attributes: depth and breadth of knowledge. This paper formulates a mathematical model and defines the goal of an EIP member as maximizing the net benefits of knowledge resulting from individual investment and effort. Numerical examples are provided to analyze patterns of optimal investment and effort plans as well as the resulting accumulated knowledge. The results provide useful managerial implications. In business conditions characterized by high interest rates or high internal rate of returns, it is preferable for members to delay spending their resources for learning. Intensive investment and efforts to obtain knowledge are preferable when the discount rate of costs is high, when knowledge is durable, when the value of knowledge is high, when the initial level of knowledge is high, when the productivity of the learning process is high, and when sufficient knowledge is transferred from other members.

Taguchi evaluates quality in terms of costs incurred, including inspection and adjustment costs apart from quality loss. Using these costs, he determines an optimal interval for periodic inspection of products. At each inspection, the first item on the process line is checked for defects. If no defects are found, the process is assumed to be under control. On the other hand, if the first item turns out to be defective, the process is immediately stopped and adjusted.
