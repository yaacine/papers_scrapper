21003,"Spectral analysis considers the problem of determining the spectral content (ie, the distribution of power over frequency) of a time series from a finite set of measurements, by means of either nonparametric or parametric techniques. The history of spectral analysis as an established discipline started more than a century ago with the work by Schuster on detecting cyclic behavior in time series. An interesting historical perspective on the developments in this field can be found in [Marple 1987]. This reference notes that the word “spectrum” was apparently introduced by Newton in relation to his studies of the decomposition of white light into a band of light colors, when passed through a glass prism (as illustrated on the front cover). This word appears to be a variant of the Latin word “specter” which means “ghostly apparition”. The contemporary English word that has the same meaning as the original Latin word is “spectre”. Despite these roots of the word “spectrum”, we hope the student will be a “vivid presence” in the course that has just started!This text, which is a revised and expanded version of Introduction to Spectral Analysis (Prentice Hall, 1997), is designed to be used with a first course in spectral analysis that would typically be offered to senior undergraduate or first–year graduate students. The book should also be useful for self-study, as it is largely self-contained. The text is concise by design, so that it gets to the main points quickly and should hence be appealing to those who would like a fast appraisal on the classical and modern approaches of spectral analysis.

It leads to simple closed-form solutions for transmission over frequency-selective multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, which are scalable with respect to the number of antennas, size of the coding block, and transmit average/peak power. The scheme operates as a block transmission system in which vectors of symbols are encoded and modulated through a linear mapping operating jointly in the space and time dimension.

In particular, while many previous works on space-time coding assume that the channel is a stochastic quantity, we find that a deterministic channel model can have some advantages for the receiver design. Finally, we illustrate our results by numerical examples.

21107,In this paper we consider the use of differential detection when there aremultiple transmitter and receiver antennas. Our differential scheme is based on the theory ofSpace-Time Block Codes that are used to achieve space-time diversity. Compared to the existingdifferential schemes for multiple antennas our scheme has a much smaller computationalcomplexity. It has the same encoding and decoding complexities as the coherent detection based on space-time block codes and achieves the same rate for up-to 8 transmitterantennas. The performance of the differential detector (which assumes no knowledge of the flat fading channel) is 3 dB less than that of the coherent detector (which uses exact channelstate information for reception). We also show that the proposed receiver is a Maximum Likelihood detector.,Girish Ganesan and Petre Stoica,114,5551461176597070902,Wireless Personal Communications,2,163-180,Kluwer Academic Publishers,Differential detection based on space-time block codes,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015627131302,21,2002,/scholar?cites=5551461176597070902,g8rknqcAAAAJ:_wawhP5Vwy0C

Furthermore, if a minimal parameterization is used, then the true predictor is the unique limit model both for PEM and for PLR.",Petre Stoica and Torsten Söderström,19,405827536230950817,Systems & control letters,6,325-331,North-Holland,Uniqueness of estimated k-step prediction models of ARMA processes,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167691184800730,4,1984,/scholar?cites=405827536230950817,g8rknqcAAAAJ:h0mLeC6b6wcC
21326,"Wide-band spectral sensing is a challenging task that will be required in future cognitive radio and radar applications. Recent research has shown that sampling using only one-bit of amplitude precision can be realized at an extremely high rate [1] in an affordable manner. In this work, one-bit sampling using time-varying thresholds is considered for line spectral estimation. The time-varying thresholds allow for amplitude estimation. A novel one-bit RELAX algorithm is developed for multi-tone parameter estimation. This algorithm is shown to have excellent performance via a numerical example.",Christopher Gianelli and Luzhou Xu and Jian Li and Petre Stoica,18,2090943849736937748,,,1-5,IEEE,One-bit compressive sampling with time-varying thresholds for multiple sinusoids,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8313172/,,2017,/scholar?cites=2090943849736937748,g8rknqcAAAAJ:sK9NQJKSZRcC
21327,"Clock synchronization is ubiquitous in wireless systems for communication, sensing, and control. In this paper, we design a scalable system in which an indefinite number of passively receiving wireless units can synchronize to a single master clock at the level of discrete clock ticks. Accurate synchronization requires an estimate of the node positions to compensate the time-of-flight transmission delay in line-of-sight environments. If such information is available, the framework developed here takes position uncertainties into account. In the absence of such information, as in indoor scenarios, we propose an auxiliary localization mechanism. Furthermore, we derive the Cramer-Rao bounds for the system, which show that it enables synchronization accuracy at sub-nanosecond levels. Finally, we develop and evaluate an online estimation method, which is statistically efficient.",Dave Zachariah and Satyam Dwivedi and Peter Händel and Petre Stoica,18,733510385652508889,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,6,3536-3546,IEEE,Scalable and passive wireless network clock synchronization in LOS environments,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7880672/,16,2017,/scholar?cites=733510385652508889,g8rknqcAAAAJ:LqrXEw5M15gC
21328,"In this paper, we propose a new approach to the design of training sequences that can be used for an accurate estimation of multi-input multi-output channels. The proposed method is particularly instrumental in training sequence designs that deal with three key challenges: 1) arbitrary channel and noise statistics that do not follow specific models, 2) limitations on the properties of the transmit signals, including total power, per-antenna power, having a constant-modulus, discrete-phase, or low peak-to-average-power ratio, and 3) signal design for large-scale or massive antenna arrays. Several numerical examples are provided to examine the proposed method.",Mojtaba Soltanalian and Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh and Nafiseh Shariati and Petre Stoica and Babak Hassibi,18,10650704342565922066,IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications,2,1135-1143,IEEE,Training signal design for correlated massive MIMO channel estimation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7782871/,16,2016,/scholar?cites=10650704342565922066,g8rknqcAAAAJ:0PPYGq5nos8C
